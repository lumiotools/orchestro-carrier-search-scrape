By tapping centralized data and predictive reports, you can proactively and systematically reduce that necessary overhead.\nFleet GPS tracking gives you the ability to see what really happened and can help you save time and money, while also protecting your drivers, maximizing efficiency, and gaining peace of mind. Regular GPS data by itself can only tell you so much, but when you incorporate live driver footage into your operations via a fleet dash cam, you can have total control of your fleet like never before.\nA fleet dash cam system from FleetOptix can verify that your drivers are following safety protocols so you can keep your vehicles on the road and your operations running smoothly. Our  fleet GPS tracking provides standard features along with video for driver-side and/or road-facing cameras.\nImprove Fleet Safety\nHaving real-time data at your fingertips will help you spot potential problems — accident-prone drivers, lease mileage issues, upcoming repairs — before they happen. The system transmits videos simultaneously from all cameras within seconds of an incident, providing instant visibility and the ability to quickly resolve liability. With a comprehensive set of data, you can also track money-saving and expense-reducing trends.\nCloud-connected GPS tracking fleet dash cameras from FleetOptix deliver continual high-quality video clips and night vision via a searchable online dashboard. In addition, the front and rear-facing cameras provide a 360-degree view. You can also run reports based on date/time for a detailed picture of the distance and time the vehicles have traveled.\nThe right fleet dash cam system will help you protect and track your vehicles in real time while also allowing you to create geo-fences and get real-time notifications on any device. You can also automatically upload event videos as-they-happen and create reports to view and print at-a-glance totals for distance driven, idle time, speeding incidents, and more.\nReal-Time Tracking\nThe FleetOptix fleet GPS tracking system gives you an intuitive way to track your fleet in real time and notify you of events — speeding, impact accidents, harsh acceleration, sudden braking. You will receive a notification and the ability to look at a number of still images taken at the time of the event. You will also get the opportunity to view a video file from the fleet dash cam.\nWith fleet GPS tracking, you can record the road and the interior of the cab, which can lead to a decrease in risky driving. Fleet dash cameras can also spot seat belt violations, distracted driving, littering, and other inappropriate driver behaviors.\nArchived video can be used to develop driver coaching and customize instruction according to the individual’s needs. Additionally, you can use the data to identify cost outliers or investigate damage or other quotas.\nBy using tools such as geofences — powered by Google and our interactive maps as well as our fleet telematics solution — you can monitor your fleet’s whereabouts. You can also maintain control of locations you’ve set as off-limits — bars, adult entertainment facilities or even the driver’s home. Fleet management from FleetOptix gives you 24/7 coverage that powers and protects your business.\n81% of Truckers Are Found Liable in Accidents!Protect your drivers and your fleet against accident claims with our GPS camerasGet a free quoteSee What Your Drivers See With A Fleet Dash Cam with GPS tracking\nWhen you own or manage a fleet of trucks or vehicles, you need to keep track of a lot of information — from who is where and in which truck to what the mileage is between points. There are times of arrival to monitor, data to analyze, regulations to stay on top of, and maintenance to schedule. And that’s just for starters.\nOne way busy fleet owners and managers stay on top of their myriad responsibilities is to leverage technology-powered tools like a dash cam with GPS tracking system. Fleet dash cameras put you in the driver’s seat so you can see what your drivers see in real-time and/or video playback.

The right GPS tracking camera system gives you the ability to mediate tough situations with fast accuracy.\nProtect Your Drivers Against Accident Claims!Our cameras have reduced disputed claims from 40% to 2% for fleet ownersGet a free quoteFleet Dash Camera systems from FleetOptix capture the entire scene\nFleet dash cameras from FleetOptix capture the entire scene, inside and out.

Said:\nNo hassle and Reduced Cost\nGoShare is my now go-to for transporting materials. We manufacture building materials that require testing at 3rd party test facilities.  Before we would fly someone into the town and rent a truck.  Now with GoShare we simply arrange a day before and the next morning materials are delivered with no hassle and reduced cost on our end. Thank you GoShare!!!\nCarmen A. Said:\nLove GoShare\nLove GoShare! I purchased furniture at Homegoods.  I was in direct communication with a GoShare rep as it was July 2 a holiday weekend. I driver accepted for next day when Homegoods opened.  I spoke to the driver and you get updates to your cellphone.  I will continue to use GoShare for all me delivery needs. The cost of transport was very reasonable too!\nRebekah B. Said:\nGreat, No Hassle Service\nThis is a great service. We booked online and the request was accepted within minutes. A few hours later our driver picked up our couch at Home Sense with no issues and delivered on time at our home shortly after.  Such a great no hassle service and our delivery guy was great!\nCrystal B. Said:\nSuper Easy, Convenient and Fast\nSuper easy. Convenient and fast. I was needing a pickup and delivery of a package so of course I went to Google and found GoShare. Being reluctant,  I did it, and the outcome was great. If you are in need of a quick, super easy and convenient delivery company GoShare is your company.  I'm from Atlanta, GA I did try reaching out to other companies before this with no response.  GoShare allowed me to do everything straight from the app, including track my package.  Thank You GoShare.\nDimitar B. Said:\nPrompt, Professional, Friendly\nGoShare was recommended in store by Bob's Discount Furniture. Signing up through the Apple iPhone App Store was easy. The process is intuitive and as simple as possible. I requested a service before we left the store - 10 minutes from start to finish. We were linked to a transport company within 10 minutes before we managed to leave the plaza. The service we received was prompt, professional, friendly, accurate and with great care. Will recommend to any friend who needs fast, reliable transport avoiding the overpriced premiums of others. Will definitely use again.\nFrancesca P. Said:\nGoShare is incredible\nGoShare is incredible.  I have used them three times now and every time they are getting me out of a bind in such an efficient and cost effective way!  This third time I used bigger truck - with one day's notice! - that was clean and big and the driver and helper were fantastic.  And it was a long distance delivery!  I am so tired of the pricing and rigidity of the traditional moving industry.  I am so grateful for GoShare.\nBrittany L. Said:\nHelpful and Professional\nGreat service! Downloaded the app and my furniture was picked up and delivered in about an hour! Musa, our driver, was helpful and professional. It's kinda like the Uber for furniture (or other heavy duty items) delivery! Highly recommend.\nAndy S. Said:\nOn Demand Courier and Freight Services\nI had been looking for a service that could provide on demand courier and freight services for my business. I came across GoShare through a Google search and could not be happier with the service thus far. I've done about a dozen orders in the past few weeks and each time the driver has been on time or early, friendly, and very helpful.\nWill J. Said:\nGreat App\nGoShare is the Uber of when you need a \"truck or a van and a guy\". Great App. Fast Response. and reasonably priced. This will become more & more popular when the word gets out. I had a guy come out with a beautiful new cargo van he bought just to be a GoShare Driver.  Great attitude and excellent service.\nBeth V. Said:\nGreat Service!\nI have found pieces of furniture at Home Goods in the past but neglected to purchased due to not having the right truck to transport- yesterday I found 2 gorgeous pieces to use in our rental home at the beach & was so happy to see the advertisement right there on top of the tv cabinet I wanted- I signed up while waiting in line & just had both pieces delivery by Henry! Very professional & punctual! Love this service & will ask for Henry in the future!\nCurran D. Said:\nAmazing Service, Fair Prices\nLoved my first experience with this company and app. The driver was able to pick up the furniture on his own without me having to meet at the store I bought the furniture from, which was convenient with my busy schedule. The driver took very good care of the furniture, using blankets and tie downs. The driver also helped move it into my house, and wow was it heavy. The driver went above and beyond, I couldn't be more pleased with this app. Thanks for running a great service.\nM. Panday Said:\nProfessional and Punctual\nHad a wonderful experience using GoShare to get a power recliner sofa with 6 big boxes delivered from local Costco store to my apartment. The individuals were very professional and punctual. The Goshare platform was simple and straight forward and I got response within minutes of submitting move request. I would recommend anyone looking to do moves or pickup to use their services. In fact while at Costco many people enquires about how and what I am using to move. The plus was that the platform allows you to add a helper to your request.

With a bold vision and trailblazer determination, they founded HYPR, in 2014, as the Passwordless Company.\nIn a short 10 years, HYPR has grown to become the gold-standard in passwordless authentication tested and proven in some of the most complex and demanding enterprise environments and successfully supporting more than 20 million global users.\nBuilding on this foundation of success, HYPR is expanding its mission and is tackling a bigger broader problem -  creating trust in the identity lifecycle.\nThe HYPR team used their expertise and experience to imagine a brand new approach to identity security that builds on the foundation of passwordless authentication with adaptive risk mitigation, automated identity verification and a simple, intuitive user experience. We call this Identity Assurance.\nCompanies Modernizing Their Identity Security With HYPR\nPrevious Slide\nNext Slide\nJoin Us\nWe built HYPR and our company culture around three specific character traits that we believe to be instrumental; grit, empathy and humility. Grit – the drive to solve previously unsolvable problems. Empathy – the ability to understand another person’s challenges. Humility – knowing that mistakes are inevitable so it’s important to move forward by learning and taking ownership. If this sounds like you, consider joining us on our quest to eliminate passwords and create trust with identity assurance.\nExplore Careers\nMeet Our Leadership Team\nHYPR is led by an experienced team of technologists, security experts and business leaders working closely together to empower and support our customers on their identity assurance journey.\nLearn More\nBojan Simic\nCEO\nLearn More\nRoman Kadinsky\nPresident & COO\nLearn More\nBaljeet Sandhu\nCTO\nLearn More\nRobert Panebianco Jr.\nChief Architect\nLearn More\nVy Chen\nVP of People\nLearn More\nRich Gibsen\nVP of Product Management\nLearn More\nAnton Gurov\nChief Information Security Officer\nLearn More\nSabrina Armer\nVP of Finance\nLearn More\nWilliam Field\nVP of Customer Success\nOur Investors\nStay Up To Date\nPress Release\nNew Report Reveals: Customer Loyalty at Stake for Financial Institutions Due to Rise in Identity-Based Attacks\nHYPR, the Identity Assurance Company, today announced a $30 million investment from Silver Lake Waterman.\nNews\nHYPR Unmasks a Fake IT Worker: North Korea Isn’t the Only Threat\nHYPR recently experienced a fake IT worker attempting to gain employment.

However, it is possible for anyone to use the Nash Wallet to store coins you have bought elsewhere or take advantage of our own exchange or our integration with 1inch to trade on decentralized exchanges at the best rate.Please join our mailing list when registering your account and we will inform you when you can invest in Cryptocurrency in your region using Nash.\nWhich payment methods can I use?\nThe easiest to use is the Nash EURO IBAN account, it is free and all transactions are settled instantaneously. Alternatively, you can also use Credit Cards, manual SEPA transfers or SEPA instant, if your bank is already supported.\nHow long until I receive my money?\nThat depends on your transaction method. For a slow, manual SEPA transfer it can take between 1 to 4 business days to complete. For all other methods you should have your funds much quicker and usually within a couple of minutes. If it takes a little longer, please be patient, your funds are safe and the process will complete soon.\nIf I buy Crypto via SEPA transfer (not an instant purchase), is the rate I am offered final, or does it change if the Crypto price changes while my transfer clears?\nThe rate can change. If the Crypto price falls, giving you a better deal, Nash automatically sells you more Crypto than we originally quoted using the new price. If the Crypto price rises, and we can no longer fill your order at the original quoted rate, we will offer you a new quote at the current rate, or the option to cancel your order.\nCan I have the coins I purchase sent to an external wallet directly, rather than to my Nash wallet?\nThe quickest and easiest way is to use a Nash Wallet, however, you can also use our Nash Widget to get the funds delivered to another wallet of yours.\nI can’t buy or sell Crypto on Nash in my region yet. Can I still use the wallet?\nYes, you can still use the Crypto wallet to store your coins. You can also take advantage of other Crypto tools and services integrated in the app, like Wallet Connect or use the wallet to track the price of your portfolio.When you create your account, you can join our mailing list and we’ll let you know when you can invest in cryptocurrency on Nash in your region.\nCan I claim GAS from NEO?\nYes. Simply click on NEO within Nash wallet and you will see a button allowing you to claim GAS.\nNash Wallet\nDoes Nash control my Crypto assets?\nNo. Nash never has access to the private keys that control your Crypto assets. You are always in control of your funds, which is why it is important to back up your 12-word wallet seed phrase.\nCan I access my Nash Crypto accounts in other wallet applications by exporting my private keys?\nYes. It is possible to extract your private keys for Bitcoin, Ethereum and other blockchains from your 12-word wallet seed phrase and import these into other applications. These keys can be viewed in the Nash webapp, but not in the mobile app.However, we do not recommend users do this. Nash is the safest Crypto wallet for your phone because we never reveal your private key and offer the ability for users to sign transactions using multi-party computation. It is more secure to keep your private keys hidden and to use your Nash Wallet.\nCan Nash block my account if someone steals my private keys?\nNash is a non-custodial exchange. This means that we do not have access to or control over assets on your account. The user is in full control of their assets. All Nash can do is prevent an account from trading on the Nash Exchange. This means that, if someone steals your private keys, they are able to withdraw assets from your Nash account.If your private keys are stolen, we recommend that you move all your assets immediately to another wallet. Please contact our support team immediately to report the case.\nWhich Crypto assets are supported by the Nash wallet?\nAt present, Nash supports all assets stored on the Bitcoin, Ethereum, NEO, Polygon, Arbitrum and Avalanche AVAX-C chains: BTC, ETH, NEO, GAS, AVAX and all ERC-20, NEP-5 and ARC-20 tokens.\nCan I export my transaction history?\nNo. You can view your transaction history but Nash does not yet provide a tool for exporting it as a CSV or similar file.\nNash isn’t displaying one of my Ethereum tokens. Can I manually add ERC-20 tokens to the wallet so they display?\nNo, this is not possible. Please contact our support team and we will add it for you.\nHow do I connect to dapps with WalletConnect?\nWalletConnect can be accessed under ‘Settings > ‘Connect with WalletConnect’. All WalletConnect transactions are signed via multi-party computation, making Nash the best digital wallet for dApps.\nCan I import an external private key into the Nash wallet?\nNo this is not possible because all individual private keys are derived from a main account which comes from the twelve secret words. If you import a random wallet not derived from the 12 words, it would break the pattern and therefore make the wallet unusable.\nCan I use a hardware wallet to secure my funds within the Nash platform?\nNash is not compatible with hardware wallets at the moment, given the way our accounts system is structured. At present, Ledger does not offer any solutions compatible with our technology.Nash has upgraded our client protocols to generate signatures with secure multi-party computation (MPC), the technology behind our decentralized API keys. Our non-custodial blockchain wallets can now offer hardware-level security at no cost!Read more here.\nNash Earn\nWhat are Crypto-powered earnings and how do they offer such high interest rates?\nLending money generates interest. When you save with a traditional bank account, you get a portion of the interest the bank earns when it lends out your money. The issue: interest rates on these savings accounts are controlled by central banks. And that’s why most banks offer very low interest rates at the moment: it’s how government policy encourages people to spend.But what if you don’t want to spend? What if you’d rather make money?Today, many people are looking for ways to make passive income beyond traditional savings accounts. But while interest rates are very low, you can still make your money work for you – with Crypto.Crypto-powered earnings, like bank savings, generate interest through lending money. But with Crypto, there are no central banks forcing low rates: blockchain platforms let you lend money at rates set by the market. That means that if more people want to borrow a particular currency, rates on loans for that currency go up – and these rates are often much higher than those offered by banks. That’s how Crypto earnings let you save money faster than traditional accounts.\nHow do Crypto earnings on Nash work?\nIt’s pretty straightforward. Nash simplifies access to Crypto earnings protocols Aave and BEEFY. These platforms give you so-called ‘interest-bearing tokens’ when you deposit funds to them, which track your interest. As Nash sells you these tokens directly, this process is faster and simpler.\nWhat are the risks?\nWe simplify access to the blockchain-based lending platforms. Our system effectively lets you deposit cash to them directly to earn interest. The good news: borrowers on these platforms typically provide more collateral than the actual size of their loans, so they should always be able to pay them back. But it’s never fully risk-free. The main risks of earnings on Nash are:Hacks of smart contracts belonging to Nash or the crypto earnings protocolsLarge exchange rate fluctuations between your national currency (e.g. EUR) and the stablecoins deposited to crypto protocols (e.g. USDC), which underlie the ‘aTokens’ purchased by Nash usersStablecoins might lose their peg and become less valuable than the represented national currency (e.g. USDC becomes less valuable than USD)It’s important to review these risks when deciding if Nash is the best savings app for you.\nIn which countries are Crypto-powered earnings available?\nCrypto-powered earnings are currently available in the European region (EU + EEA + Switzerland).\nAre my Crypto earnings on Nash insured?\nAt present, we’re not able to offer insurance on Crypto earnings.\nDo the rates change?\nYes, they can. We offer a choice between a number of Crypto earnings protocols. Rates may fluctuate independently for each of them. You can add funds to a mixture of protocols as part of your earnings portfolio and Nash will calculate your current and 30-day average Annual Equivalent Rate.Annual Equivalent Rate (AER), is used to show what you would earn in interest from different savings accounts over a year. AER makes it easier to compare savings accounts that might have differences between them. It's a bit like how APR works for borrowing products such as loans.\nCan I deposit my existing Crypto (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Stablecoins) to earnings on Nash?\nUnfortunately, that’s not possible. Our system only lets you add funds in the form of national currency. But you have the option to deposit your existing Crypto to a platform like Aave or BEEFY with WalletConnect.\nHow can I withdraw my funds if Nash goes down?\nIt’s best to wait for Nash to come back online. If you’re a tech-savvy expert user, you can interact with our earnings smart contracts directly by programming a transaction, but we definitely don’t recommend this. You can find more information here. You can monitor the status of Nash here.\nIs my balance compounded?\nYes, it is. Balances are compounded constantly with every new Ethereum block (roughly every 10–20 seconds), so you can save money even faster.\nNash Crypto IBANs\nHow does Nash protect my fiat money?\nNash has partnered with Modulr an electronic money institute (EMI), who maintains all customer funds inside a safeguarding account, legally separated from Modulr itself. This is in line with the European requirement of safeguarding customer funds. More information is available on Modulr’s “How we keep your money safe” document.\nWhat happens to my money if Nash goes bankrupt?\nYour money is safe! If Nash or Modulr go bankrupt, your money is not affected. More information is available on Modulr’s “How we keep your money safe” document.\nWhat happens if I send to the wrong IBAN account?\nAlways make sure that the recipient is the recipient you want to send the money to. However, if you make a transfer to the wrong account we can try to contact the bank and reclaim your money but cannot guarantee we will be successful.\nCan I send funds internationally to non-IBAN accounts like SWIFT?\nNo, we currently only support transactions to IBAN accounts.\nCan my Nash Crypto IBAN account be hacked?\nNash has undergone an extensive IT security audit to avoid any sort of misconduct on our platform. Further, both Nash and Modulr monitor for unusual transactions to ensure that no illicit transactions happen on the platform.\nCan Modulr steal my funds?\nYour funds are outside of the control of Modulr. The funds are stored in a separate entity with the single purpose of keeping your funds safe.\nWhy did my SEPA transfer fail?\nSeveral factors can lead to a failed SEPA transfer. Some common reasons include:Insufficient funds: If your account does not have enough funds to cover the transfer amount, the transaction will failIncorrect account details: Entering incorrect or incomplete beneficiary account information, such as the IBAN (International Bank Account Number) or BIC (Bank Identifier Code), can cause a transfer to fail.Technical issues: Occasionally, technical glitches or system maintenance by the involved banks or financial institutions can lead to failed transfers.\nWill my direct debit go through if I am low on funds?\nYou can fully use all the money you have on your account but if your balance is too low for the transaction amount, then this transaction will not go through.\nHow do I get an account statement?\nPlease contact support and we will send you your statement.Compliance and RegistrationNash was the first Crypto Platform in Europe registered by the Financial Market Authority (FMA) of Liechtenstein.

In one touch. Dreams or reality?\nThis is the mission we are fully dedicated to. We have a vision to introduce sustainable last-mile delivery Logtech anywhere in the world.\nManaging a delivery shouldn’t take more than a few clicks!\nAbout Us: From Driving Experience To Delivery Experience\nAt VanOnGo, we're driven by innovation and a proven track record of success. Our co-founder’s team's solid experience in the automotive industry has already revolutionized the way we navigate with cutting-edge AR technology*, putting a premium on the driving experience.\nNow, we're channeling that same passion and expertise into logistics. In both automotive and logistics, our focus is on delivering excellent experiences. Today, logistics is about more than just moving goods; it's about creating digital experiences for customers and helping businesses thrive.\nWe've seen firsthand how innovation can transform industries and are dedicated to fundamentally changing the logistics landscape. Join us in shaping the future, where every delivery is an exceptional experience.\nWith our SaaS you're joining a movement to redefine logistics for a digital age. Be part of something extraordinary. Join us on the mission, and let's revolutionize logistics together, bringing a commitment to excellence from driving experience to delivery experience.\n*Founding Team was a part of the Apostera - the Mixed Reality Munich based startup who has disrupted the Driving Experience in Automotive by bringing AR tech to HUDs, thus merging the physical and digital worlds together. Success story: from idea to mass production with premium German OEM just in 4 years. Samsung acquired the company at the beginning of 2022.\nMilestones\nOur journey began in the vibrant city of Tallinn, Estonia back in August 2019. From the very start, we set out with a consumer-centric vision.\nIn November 2020, we made a bold move and pivoted our model to serve businesses. This shift allowed us to spread our wings and extend our product portfolio to cater to a wide array of merchants with OnGo Business, and delivery fleets with OnGo Fleet.\nFast forward to December 2021, and we were celebrating a significant milestone - 150,000 successful deliveries. In December 2022, we marked another incredible achievement with 500,000 deliveries, expanding our reach to include Germany, Romania, and Poland.\nThrough dedication, innovation, and a commitment to serving our clients, we've transformed from a local startup into a global force in logistics. And the best part? Our story is still unfolding, with new chapters waiting to be written. Join us as we continue to shape the future of logistics, making it simpler, smarter, and more efficient for everyone.\nSome Of Our Trusted Customers\nWe got a good reliable partner with whom we can open other markets.

Ita soon realized that the biggest opportunity in e-commerce lay in the period that was least in retailers’ control: the journey from warehouse to doorstep. Veho was created to challenge the received wisdom of the entire logistics industry—to promise that delivery and returns can be a critical, and, most importantly, enjoyable part of the e-commerce experience.We’re driving commerce forward.

The world needs supply chains that are integrated,  adaptable, and resilient.\nThat’s where 7bridges comes in. Our platform creates outcome-driven, smarter supply chains that benefit everyone.\nBut don’t just take our word for it. We’ve won a host of awards across the industry.\nWe work with visionary, high-growth businesses from all sorts of industries\nThe 7bridges platform can work with all manner of supply chain data, no matter how complex.\nWe’ve helped businesses in med-tech, healthcare, retail and manufacturing reinvent the way they think about their supply chain.\nFrom maximising revenue to improving performance and reducing emissions, our platform gives you the power to make your supply chain perform exactly the way you need it to.\nMeet our founders\nPhilip Ashton\nFounder & CEO\nLinkedIn\nMatei Beremski\nFounder & CTO\nLinkedIn\n7bridges was founded to create powerful change through supply chains and software.\nDeep in the belly of a large logistics provider, Phil had front row seats to the amount of waste that went into supply chains, even as supply chain leaders tried to wrestle them into an efficient state. When he brought the problem to data-focused Matei, they discovered that this wasn’t an industry-specific or location-specific issue. This is a problem for all supply chains everywhere. And it is one that impacts a lot more than a business’ bottom line.\n“Inefficiency is no longer a concept that you feel you should care about. It’s become something that affects real people in the real world.” (Philip Ashton, CEO)\nAnd so 7bridges was born. Determined to turn the preconceptions of how to run a supply chain on their heads, 7bridges now makes supply chains smarter and better prepared to tackle any potential disruptions.\nToday, after a successful Series A funding round and the growth from three to almost 100 supply chain experts, 7bridges is on a mission to help businesses create the best version of their supply chain: So people can always access the best product.

One truth prevailed regardless of the role or industry: it was a mess. There were way too many emails, tons of moving pieces, and needless cooks in the kitchen. Somehow, it was easier to transport from Nigeria to NYC than it was to get something from Brooklyn to Manhattan.Her final straw was a project that required getting a hard drive from Brooklyn to Jersey in 2 hours. The ask wasn’t insane, but the $300 quote was. Joshe’s ingenuity got the hard drive to Jersey on time and for 1/5 of the cost. This was her aha moment: give the old school NYC courier service a 21st century update. On that day, Airpals was born and happy customers were made.The brains behind it allJoshe OrdóñezCEO & Founder Joshe Ordóñez started her fashion career quickly after graduating college. Her creativity and expertise drew in invitations to speak at events, including one at the United Nations.\nIn fashion and other operational-heavy fields, one issue always came up for Joshe: internal logistics. After solving an expensive local logistics ask with a reasonable solution, she pivoted from fashion to tech in order to create Airpals. Joshe’s knack for marrying simplicity and design allow her to make Airpals incredibly user-friendly and reliable. Google agrees. Joshe was 1 of 50 to be awarded from Google’s Latino Funders Fund.\nWhen she’s out of the office, Joshe loves reading Latino/Latina success stories and enjoying the city. NYC provides her with endless inspiration and interesting people that contribute to solutions for Airpals.The Airpals approach to courier serviceThe Airpals approach to courier serviceAirpals takes a triple bottom-line, sustainable approach to NYC’s B2B courier service industry. We care about people first, then the planet, then profits. Caring about people nourishes your community. Our workers earn a liveable wage and we love uplifting women and people of color. Empathy is one of our core values, that’s why we have ‘pals’ in our name.For the planet, we use smart, efficient routes to lower carbon emissions. Our sustainability goes beyond the environment. Airpals wants to have natural growth with a positive impact on society.We also love to question. Questioning outdated courier delivery service led to our creation and guides our future. We wonder how things can be done better. Our customers think the same way when they’re at work; that’s why they reach out to us.We do B2B with personalityWe do B2B  with personalityUnsung operational heroes work at front desks and behind the scenes.

Many retailers had a hard time keeping up with rising customer expectations, and did not have a reliable, affordable solution for 2-day delivery. The founders of Better Trucks noticed that many retailers were frustrated with level of service and prices of traditional 3PLs such as FedEx and UPS. Delivery was expensive, slow, and overall delivered a very lackluster experience to the end consumers.\nTHE SOLUTION\nWe created Better Trucks, a lean, technology-focused organization that helps your Brands thrive in this NOW or NEVER economy. We recognize that every package delivered must represent your Brand and provide to your customers a memorable customer experience. We keep this in mind and accommodate costs to help you exceed those expectations while growing. Behind every package is a family, a life, a human being, who is relying on us to safely deliver.

Our software delivers a fully digital solution connecting all stakeholders within the inbound gate-to-gate process.\nHow it Works\nFreightSmith is revolutionizing how businesses manage their warehouse receiving process by providing a comprehensive suite of digital freight management services that are easy to use yet powerful enough for even the most complex operations. From its remote pre-check capability of up to 24hrs in advance of delivery, and 24/7/365 customer support, to its real-time updates at the receiver level for all deliveries along with instant access to all digital unloading receipts including a comprehensive load management tool supporting door assignment and PO/load resolution. FreightSmith has everything warehouse managers need to remain competitive in today’s ever-evolving supply chain landscape. With its innovative technology solutions directly linked to other operating systems via API FreightSmith is setting a new standard for digital freight management services.\nFreightSmith IMS – Inbound Management System\nThe FreightSmith IMS warehouse portal is the key to any receiving manager’s success in expediting inbound operational flow. The IMS solution allows staff to communicate directly with drivers as they provide gate passes for trucks to enter their facility as well as assign doors and notify drivers immediately when a door is available and ready.\nThe IMS tool time stamps and tracks every step of the way for each load, allowing receiving managers to monitor inbound progress, track staged vehicles, and proactively reduce detention exposure at their entire facility.\nFreightSmith completes the chain and provides the data linkage that can be used to optimize any warehouse receiving process eliminating the black hole in the supply chain path.\nLearn More\nFreightSmith – Mobile App\nThe mobile app is available for free in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.\nOnce the driver downloads the application on their smartphone, they will be able to check-in remotely for their scheduled appointment as well as gain access to full visibility of the gate-to-gate process for their delivery. The FreightSmith check-in process can be completed away from the facility at a convenient time and location to optimize the driver’s HOS. Most valuable to drivers and carriers is that they can process unloading payments from within the app with digital receipts supplied that can be accessed later as needed. The digital documentation can easily be shared with shippers and carriers ensuring a complete record of the delivery in a timely manner.\nAll of this can be done from the safety and comfort of the cab of their truck.\nLearn More\nFreightSmith SchedulePro\nFreightSmith SchedulePro is the ultimate solution for streamlining and simplifying warehouse appointment scheduling – the dynamic, yet cost-effective tool designed by experts from inbound warehouse operations.

We are committed to providing our customers, regardless of their locations, with fast delivery times, affordable costs, and exceptional customer service.\nInternational Bridge traces its roots back to 1997, when we embarked on a remarkable journey, connecting distant corners of the world through the power of shipping. It all began with our vision to bridge the gap between the United States and Japan. Back then, we specialized in shipping exquisite vintage clothes from the US to Japan, fostering a bridge of trust with our customers. This commitment to connecting people and businesses across borders became the cornerstone of International Bridge, and we have carried this spirit forward ever since. Today, as our company name suggests, we continue to facilitate seamless e-commerce experiences, proudly connecting businesses and customers since 1997.\nIn 2003, International Bridge began changing the small-parcel shipping paradigm by efficiently reaching consumers in non-continental areas such as Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, US territories, and military addresses. Since then, we have gone the extra mile for our customers, who have been instrumental in the growth of our shipping network. Today, we provide high-volume shippers, both domestic and international, with the ability to reach consumers in all parts of the United States through a variety of shipping solutions.\nBeing the bridge for e-commerce\nThe key to the growth of our shipping programs is leveraging technology in all aspects of our business.

Our commitment to being people-centric is the foundation of our business strategy. With dedicated employees, innovative technology, and a passion for going the extra mile, we are changing the small-parcel shipping paradigm.

I would not hesitate to recommend this company!!Jackie CThe extra level of service by a regional carrier such as LSO makes the difference in gaining and maintaining clients.John TOur firm, McCall, Parkhurst & Horton, has been an LSO customer for 30 years, and we have always appreciated your service and staff, but tonight your employees went way beyond your great company and service, and we thank you. Please let the San Antonio courier Manager, the Customer Service Representative, and the courier know how much we appreciate getting our package picked up after it was accidentally deposited in the LSO bin shortly after the 6:00 pm deadline. We called customer service to see if the courier could come back, and they did!! Your dutiful customer service rep, Andrea (I think that is her name) and your night Manager and the pickup person, should all be acknowledged as exemplary team members and recognized by LSO. Again, thank you, and we are loyal customers and so appreciate your loyalty to us to get the job done of delivering our package to Austin Monday morning. Again, so grateful, and thank you for having employees that care.Kathy S. cooperOur trust in them has been unblemished.keith patricioWe have exceptional response times with LSO. The nature of our business, plus our steady business growth, requires a number of capabilities in the regional shipping partner we choose – reliability, responsiveness, flexibility and price – to name a few.Maryann StoddardWe take shipping seriously. Lone Star provides consistent and reliable service day in and day out.Norma Linda hortadoLSO is outstanding their level of service goes beyond what FedEx and UPS can even dream of providing. On-time always and outstanding. Thank you LSO! We are happy!Normand doverI had a problem with delivery. Two days that nobody showed up after waiting those full days. The tracking said resident, not at home which was not true. My husband is very handicapped which is why I have things delivered. I called customer service and spoke with Peggy who was a Godsend! She went out of her way to make sure my package is delivered today. It’s very refreshing to know there are still people around in this day and age who are outstanding in the jobs they hold. Thank you, Peggy, for caring enough!!!Patricia MuellerPartnersWe have partnered with leader carriers who provide services similar to LSO throughout the rest of the country. By forming these strategic alliances, we can provide nationwide service with the flexibility, customization, and personalized service of a regional carrier.thanks a dozenCustomer Cookie ProgramClaim your rewardMy accountShip with LSOInformationShip a packageCreate an LSO accountSchedule an LSO pickupService center locatorShipping suppliesCustomer ServiceAbout usLSO shipping ratesContact SalesCookie programHolidaysPartnersFuel SurchargesConnect with usFacebookTwitterInstagramLinkedinYoutubeGot a question?Contact usEmail customerservice@lso.comCall us (888) 688-69092800 E Plano Parkway, Suite 300, Plano, Texas, 75074© Copyrights 2021 LSO Inc.

Each type is designed with functionality and aesthetics in mind, ensuring that your product not only arrives safely but also presents beautifully to your customers.\nWhat's the difference between stock packaging and custom packaging?\nStock packaging refers to pre-made, standard-sized packaging readily available for use. It's cost-effective but lacks brand-specific design. Custom packaging, on the other hand, is designed specifically for a brand, allowing for unique sizes, designs, and branding elements like logos.\nHow long does it take to produce and deliver custom packaging orders?\nOur production and delivery timeline is optimized for efficiency. The exact timeframe depends on factors like order size, customization complexity, and shipping destination. We strive to balance swift delivery with maintaining the highest quality standards in your custom packaging.\nHow do I get my tracking info?\nLog onto Arka account\nIs there a minimum order quantity for custom packaging?\nWe understand that businesses have varying needs, so we offer low minimum order quantities to make our services accessible to both small and large businesses. This flexibility helps you manage inventory and costs effectively.\nCan I get a prototype or sample of my custom packaging before placing a large order?\nYes, we provide prototypes and samples so you can assess the quality and fit of your custom packaging. This step ensures that you are completely satisfied with the design and material before committing to a larger order and designing you ideal custom boxes.\nDo you offer any after-sales support or customer service for custom packaging orders?\nCustomer satisfaction is a top priority for us. We offer comprehensive after-sales support and customer service to address any questions or concerns you may have post-purchase. Our team is committed to ensuring your complete satisfaction with your custom packaging.\nHow should I share my custom colors with Arka?\nCMYK or HEX.Read more about custom colours here\nRead more\nCan you provide estimated turnaround times?Turnaround times are dependent on the type of packaging selected.\nMailer BoxesDigital Proofing: 1-2 daysEstimated Standard Production: 7 to 10 business daysEstimated Rush Production: 3 to 6 business daysOrders of 1000 units or more may extend lead times by up to a weekShipping: 2-14 daysCartonsDigital Proofing: 6-7 daysEstimated Production: 4-5 weeksShipping: 2-14 daysKeynotes:Going into production is dependent on the digital proof approval, if you need to make any tweaks the digital proofing timeline starts again.\nBags Digital Proofing: 1 - 2 daysEstimated Production: 4 - 8 weeksShipping: included in production turnaround timeSamplesDigital Proofing: 1-2 daysProduction: 15 business daysShipping: 2-14 days\nEverything is made in the USA so shipping varies between 2 to 7 days for parcel shipping and 2 - 14 days for freight shipping depending on where the items need to travel to.\nComplete FAQs\n(619) 612-5931\nCustom Design\nCustom Boxes\nAll Products\nInspiration\nSustainability\nAffiliate Program\nRequest Custom Quote\nRequest Dieline\nAbout Us\nCustom Boxes\nBlog\nPartners\nContact Us\nFAQ\nTerms & Conditions\nDownload Your Packaging Checklist\nPackaging 101 Guide\nTypes of Packaging\nPackaging Ideas\nBigCommerce App\nSquare App\nShipbob Integration\n14 Day Free Shopify Trial\nSign up for tips & tricks\njoin\nChoosing a selection results in a full page refresh.",

With real-time safety tracking, AI-powered inspections, and automated quality checks, we're not just processing goods; we're ensuring they meet the high standards our clients deserve. This partnership has elevated our operations, enhancing both efficiency and client satisfaction.\nCory Mack\nDirector of Operations at Holmatro\nArvist has done a fantastic job helping Holmatro see opportunities to utilize AI software. They originally came in to help with safety and ergonomics and ended up helping improve our building security and receiving process. They were very patient with us and listen to our needs. The software engineers not only took our information and created something great but they also added features we didn’t think possible. They have really gone above and beyond what we originally thought possible.\nLeo Chen\nDirector of IT at Bloomsung\nArvist helped us design and implement a system to monitor the inbound traffic to our yard using our existing security cameras. We are able to monitor 24/7 now instead of relying on security guards to collect all the information we need. The Arvist team is very constructive and responsive.

The company has strong growth, good financial sustainability and thus contributes to leading the focus on sustainability in logistics.  For Centiro, employees are the company's most important resource and great emphasis is placed on creating a culture where everyone feels involved in the company's success. The strong culture means that there is courage to challenge traditional norms and established approaches to building value-creating services and processes.Through innovative solutions and dedicated customer teams, Centiro has developed its processes and working methods in a unique way and created a customer-oriented business development that is world-class. Centiro is a very good role model and a worthy recipient of the Swedish Quality Award. Gustaf Stawåsen, CISO at Centiro says, “I believe our unique way of working with our culture, our colleagues at heart, and a partner-driven customer focus – challenge traditional structures and non-value metrics. The process with SIQ has been comprehensive in many steps, with an amazing evaluation team and great questions and discussions. A rare, rewarding and enlightening experience”.  The Swedish Quality Award highlights role models and is given to organizations that have demonstrated significant results from their successful quality work. The operations are illuminated from a holistic perspective where strengths and opportunities for improvement are identified in detail based on the SIQ Management model, which is a basis for how organizations achieve success with their operations. SIQ – the Swedish Institute for Quality is the national center for business excellence in Sweden. They are a non-profit organization founded in 1990 with the support of the Swedish Government as well as their members association, private companies, institutions, and the public sector. Niklas Hedin, Centiro CEO says, “Challenging status quo and norms, even in quality management, to reach better outcomes for our customer, with a strong people- and culture focus has been our DNA from day one. The tireless efforts of our amazing colleagues, and a crisp vision of how we want to push the possible has now brought us to the top.

To understand, make sense. The industry nomenclature around supply chain software systems is no different. Categories and distinctions were created in a time when the world was different. And the nomenclature around parcel management, first- and or final mile has yet to catch up.\nAnd by the way, you may or may not agree, this is my opinion. But it’s well-founded. A couple of things are making sure the maps have to be updated, and perhaps new categories invented. Digitization, Pandemic, well, I think I’ll stop right there.\nSure, we have a cloud offering in the space of Parcel Management. It does what it says on the tin really well. It’s just that it is used to do so much more, or perhaps even for other reasons than to just ship a box, and few of our customers – many of which who are changing the game out there as you read this – use that nomenclature. Piling bricks or building a cathedral? I know the winners out there think different.\nIntelligent balancing of network capacity across partners. Real time, consumer-facing optimization that takes network capacity, carrier service portfolio, economy and sustainable aspects into consideration while maintaining that the important part – the promise for a given delivery date – is kept. Double-digit percentage savings while increasing capacity, reach and on-time performance. Rapid on-boarding of network partners and thousands of stores to create a virtual, digitally connected network that executes far and beyond your own assets, increasing inventory availability while shortening distance to market, resulting in strategic supply-chain capabilities on par with the biggest and best in the market. Parcel Management? Perhaps. I suggest it’s more than that.\nAnd yes, at the core lies strong functional capabilities that seem trivial at first glance. Of course, there are additions and modules you can extend our Parcel Management offering with like visibility, financial control etc. - still functional, useful and value-creating. Couple that with a clever strategy and assemble the parts and systems in a different way than normal. Boom - that’s when magic happens, and Parcel Management as a tool and even category can move from a System of Record and Execution to become a System of Innovation – a strong catalyst that is core to the empowerment of disruptive strategy, where timelines from ideation to business impact and excellence, shrink. Where differentiation truly happens. I have a lot of good observations, which involves anything from seemingly trivial items like clothes and shoes and transformation of retail to seriously important items like enabling and controlling the distribution of vaccines to fight the corona virus.\nSo those are my two cents. There is of course more to talk about. There are lots of things to do, to change and to make better, smarter and faster. Perhaps you are in the middle of these challenges and are wondering how to get a grip and structured thought on what to do. Well, don’t be a stranger. This is in fact our daytime job, to help and to modernize supply chains.\nIn the meantime, I present you with a market guide for Multi Carrier Parcel Management Systems. It’s a good read, and our company is in it. Modules, geographic coverage and all. But I wouldn’t stop there. I encourage you to reach out, as there is so much more to talk about. We’re on a mission. Are you?\n{{cta('38967cde-b2f3-48a8-8751-0aaf4db673d5','justifycenter')}}17FebRead more   ReportsCentiro recognized as Representative Vendor in Gartner Market GuideCentiro recognized as representative vendor in Gartner 2021 Market Guide for Multicarrier Parcel Management SolutionsWhat is in the Report\"Parcel delivery levels and returns are accelerating.

Inventory is the lifeblood of your business, make it strategic.\nOur company.\nWhile most platforms offer segmented solutions, ChannelApe provides a holistic approach to inventory operations. Instead of navigating through multiple vendors for integration, management tools, and business intelligence, brands can find everything they need with ChannelApe. Our offering is not just better; it's distinctively different.\nWe're pioneering the future by introducing the Strategic Inventory Operations market. In an era where retail brands navigate the complexities of global inventories and multi-channel sales, ChannelApe is setting the benchmark for how modern brands can turn operations into a super-power for growth.\nThe future of retail isn't solely about flashy marketing; it's about the meticulous precision of strategic inventory operations. In our eyes, for a brand to truly make its mark, it must master both facets: dazzling marketing and impeccable operations. This vision underscores the critical role of inventory operations in shaping a brand's trajectory to success.\nImagine a post-COVID world where retail brands, burdened with excess inventory, grapple with unprecedented challenges. While many scoured for answers in obsolete ERP systems, we conceived a forward-thinking approach: Strategic Inventory Operations. ChannelApe's inception stems from the conviction that contemporary obstacles demand innovative solutions. Our narrative is one of empowerment, enabling brands to navigate and prosper in today's volatile market.\nEvery nuance of ChannelApe, from its seamless integrations to its insightful visualizations, resonates with our ethos of strategic inventory operations. Brands that ally with ChannelApe aren't merely accessing a tool; they're embracing a paradigm shift in inventory thinking.\nIn the bustling realm of retail, two fundamental pillars delineate a brand's success trajectory: Marketing and Operations. As brands funnel substantial resources into marketing, they often neglect the archaic operational systems that tether them. ChannelApe's perspective is unequivocal: For a brand to truly realize its potential and valuation, it must champion strategic inventory operations with the same fervor as its marketing endeavors.\nIn the ever-evolving tapestry of retail, Strategic Inventory Operations isn't a mere option; it's an imperative. Brands that discern and champion this truth are not destined to merely survive; they are poised to dominate.\nOur mission\nWe are dedicated to empowering retail brands in the modern marketplace. By pioneering Strategic Inventory Operations, we provide a comprehensive approach to navigate complex inventories, ensuring brands not only adapt but thrive in the evolving retail landscape.\nDo your life's best work with us.\nJoin a worldwide team, dedicated to empowering brands with purpose-driven solutions that make a positive impact.\nSee open positions\n228 Park Ave SPMB 82108New York, New York10003-1502\nProduct\nLogin\nAPI docs\nKnowledgebase\nStatus\nSupport\nCompany\nBlog\nFulfillment partner program\nCareers\nBranding Guidelines\n© 2022 ChannelApe  Privacy Policy Terms of Service",

CloudSort offers a game-changing solution that not only streamlines logistics operations but also delivers substantial cost savings compared to traditional shipping options. Read MoreARTICLEThe Multiple Advantages of Reusable Containers in TransportationAdoption of reusable containers is trending higher within the transportation industry. While the primary incentive for adopting reusable transport packaging tends to be cost savings related to reduced consumables spend, other factors have also contributed to the increased adoption of reusable containers. Read MoreARTICLEUnlocking the Full Potential of Zone SkippingToday's supply chains are increasingly complex, leading to a maze of touchpoints that can introduce inefficiencies and raise costs. For every additional touch—each time a package is handled, sorted, or stored—the risks of delays, damage, and ballooning costs escalate. This fragmentation also degrades the overall customer experience. How can businesses minimize these issues?Read MoreInsightsSolving Logistics Challenges with Container TrackingThe logistics industry faces numerous challenges daily, from managing complex supply chains to meeting customer expectations for fast, accurate deliveries. One of the most persistent problems in logistics is the lack of visibility and control over shipments, particularly during the middle mile—the vital link between warehouses, distribution centers, and fulfillment hubs. This lack of control leads to delays and missing shipments resulting in customer dissatisfaction, revenue loss, and a variety of other problems.Read MoreInsightsPurpose-Built Containers Can Enhance the Effectiveness of Your Cross-Dock StrategyCross-docking can streamline operations, reduce handling time, and accelerate delivery to meet rising customer expectations. In the context of transporting goods such as packages or inventory, cross-docking refers to when these goods are transferred from one load to another without individual items being sorted. CloudSort containers help organizations increase cross-dock opportunities - transforming how goods are handled, stored, and distributed.Read MorePressCloudSort Containers honored in Fast Company Innovation By Design Awards 2024!CloudSort was honored in Fast Company's Innovation by Design Awards for 2024 in the Best Circular Design category and Best Design in North America category.

We are inventing a new model for the middle mile, driving efficiency, flexibility, and scalability through a trusted network that breaks the stalemate and delivers results—for everyone.Our ValuesImagine better.

I could see from our initial demo that it was going to meet our needs, but the icing on the cake was the fact that DesktopShipper customized the last few features we asked for. They worked hand-in-hand with us to make a program that quite literally does EVERYTHING we need it to. In a world of close box software solutions, this was so refreshing.\nShipWise is the third shipping software we've used in production environment over the last 7 years, and is by the far the best I've encountered. As a 3PL, we ship thousands of packages per day, with the need to account for a multitude of variables in our order data at any given time. DSX has inherently been able to handle these situations in most cases, and the ShipWise team has generally been able to accommodate even our edge cases. Not only would I recommend the software, I have provided real time demonstrations of its usage to mutual 3rd parties.Nick E.\nApplication Support Analyst, eFulfillment\nApplication Support Analyst\neFulfillment\nOut of the box, DSX was a solid solution for us.

We have been using ShipWise for almost 10 years and there is a reason we are still with them. No one can print labels faster!

According to us, the only acceptable solution to a problem is not the easy one, but the best one for our users, no matter how difficult the challenge might be. Therefore, our ambition is to build an AI-based system which really helps people do their job more efficiently rather than replace them.\nOur name  : Kardinal\nFrom “Cardinal”, it relates to cardinal points used for finding your way around, just like our AI companion helps our clients take the best decisions.\nMoreover, it also refers to the cardinal concept in Mathematics, namely the number of elements in a set. Our name expresses our vision of being a guidance for decision making, as well as a powerful tool for handling infinite complexity.\nOur values\nAt Kardinal, we aggregate the most talented people around our one genuine goal: helping our clients get the most efficient tours, no matter what.\nWe dareTake on every challenge.Make a meaningful impact. Aim high.\nWe supportEach other in our lives and in our jobs.Humans with our technology. Our clients in transforming their business.\nWe growIndividually by honing ourselves.As a team by sharing successes.Responsibly through sustainable choices.\nGet the latest news from Kardinal!\nRead our latest articles to learn more about the logistics industry.\nBy submitting this form, I confirm that I agree to receive communications from Kardinal.\nKardinal\nUse Cases\nIndustries\nARO – Always-On Route Optimization Solution API\nTAO – Territory Analytics & Optimization\nAbout us\nClients testimonials\nSectoral Case Studies\nVideos and reports\nFAQ\nBlog\nContact us\nGet started\nENFRDEES\nKardinal, better tours no matter what©2023 • All rights reservedLegal Notices\nSolutions\nUse Cases\nIndustries\nKardinal\nAbout Kardinal\nThe Kardinal Team\nOur commitments\nPartners\nResources\nBlog\nClients cases and testimonials\nCase Studies\nDownloadable reports and videos\nFAQ\nContact\nENFRDE\nKardinal, Better tours no matter what©2019 • All rights reserved",

We offer web-based shipping, inventory and\ndropshipping apps that help ecommerce sellers take their businesses to the next level. Our mission is to\nequip\nsmall and medium-sized businesses with apps that help accelerate their growth.\nFor over a decade, thousands of online merchants have trusted us to help them\nmanage and grow their businesses.\nFun Facts\n2010\nOrdoro launched\n15\ncurrent employees\n$1.7 billion\nGMV processed (past 12\nmonths)\n16.6 million\nSKUs tracked (past 12\nmonths)\nWant the long version? Learn how we went from MBA class\nproject to self-sustaining, cash flow positive business with thousands of active customers.\nRead our Starter\nStory\n→\nSmall Team. Big Results.\nHow does a tiny team tackle the ginormous problems of the “unsexy” side of ecommerce? Simply put, we take our\njobs way more seriously than we take ourselves.\nSure, it’s a daunting mission, but we’ve rallied around it by fostering an inclusive and collaborative\nenvironment for our employees, customers, and partners. We’re VERY passionate about creating, supporting, and\nselling our software and have a lot more fun working here than we should.\nProduct\nProduct decisions are heavily-guided by customer feedback.\nEvery member of Ordoro is encouraged to record and track product feedback while interacting with\ncustomers, partners, vendors, and advisors — no matter what team they’re on. This gathered data is\nfrequently analyzed and incorporated into our monthly engineering sprints. This methodology creates a\ngreater sense of ownership of our platform and also allows us to release and iterate on features more\nefficiently. Our customers are also kept in the loop as we openly share our product roadmap with them.\nDesign\nOur Design team handles both our UI/UX as well as our graphic design.\nTheir main focuses are to design and build (yes, they actually code) elegant experiences in our platform\nwhile also pushing our brand forward by overseeing all of our creative marketing initiatives. This\nmultidisciplinary approach is crucial to the iterative methodology we practice with all of our projects\nand also lends itself to a much more cohesive brand journey for our new customers.\nEngineering\nOur Engineers work directly with all of our teams (and some customers).\nOur cross-functional Engineering team handles all things technical with the platform (building new\nfeatures, managing the infrastructure, answering api forum questions, etc) while also working closely\nwith all other groups at Ordoro for gathering requirements and testing. Truly collaborative, they work\niteratively and release code weekly, fostering a continuous feedback loop with our users.\nMarketing\nOur scrappy Marketing team is equal parts creative and equal parts analytical.\nThey love crafting authentic brand content just as much as they love analyzing how much impact it has on\ngrowing our business. They understand this is a crowded space, so they work tirelessly to reach the\nright people at the right time and showcase our unique set of offerings. By the time a potential\ncustomer is talking with our Sales team, they should be feeling pretty excited about getting on board\nwith Ordoro.\nSales\nOur Sales team’s focus is to learn your business needs to determine if Ordoro is the right\nsolution for you.\nOur Sales team’s first priority is to ensure that the potential customer and Ordoro are a good fit —\neven if that means turning some away and recommending alternative software to them. This is accomplished\nby first digging in and discovering the customer’s needs, designing the solution to meet those needs,\nand then helping the customer create a path to transition into Ordoro. They are also supported by the\nrest of the company in this endeavor. Our customers tell us that it’s a refreshing, conversational\nexperience, and we can see why.\nCustomer Support\nYou will always talk to an actual Ordoro employee when you contact Customer Support.\nThis dedicated team knows the ins-and-outs of our platform and also partners with our customers to\nunderstand the needs of their businesses. They handle all of the testing and QA of our weekly releases,\nso they’re always up to speed on new features and bug fixes that go into the wild.

We provide a holistic view of the business and and are able to produce actual value. We always have an eye towards the operational and financial sides of your business to help discover what investments you’re looking for.\nAnti-Consulting Consulting Firm\nWe don’t hire a lot of “traditional” pie-in-the-sky consultants.  We hire creative, data-driven, trusted operators.  No matter the need, we will find the right operator, team, or talent to fill that gap.  Instead of working with MBA students fresh out of college, you get experienced eCommerce operators who have been in the space and understand what it takes to be profitable and make intelligent investments.\nHear From Our Clients\nNick Pendrous, CIO & GM eCommerce at H2 Brands Group“I was seeking a consulting partner to provide a health check on our staff resources, IT systems and the operational capabilities supporting our growing eCommerce business. We were seeking both strategic insight coupled with recommended tactical steps to bridge identified gaps. Early on, we identified RMW Commerce as the \"more steak than sizzle\" partner we were looking for. They brought to the assignment indisputable industry experts in our product categories plus, when compared to other mid-market consulting firms we evaluated, a demonstrably greater understanding of the marketplace domain in which we operate. Definitely check out Rick and his team if you are looking for similar types of evaluation.”\nEffy Zinkin, COO, General Counsel of WHP Global\n“Over the 6 months I have been working with Rick Watson, he is a gem and best-in-class expert in the E-Commerce world.  His references come across as a “Who’s Who” in the world of E-Commerce, and they are all accurate.”\nEddie Capel, President & CEO, Manhattan Associates\n\"Rick, really appreciated your time yesterday and of course all the work you put in running up to our session. I found your comments and counsel very insightful.”\nJason Caldwell, CEO, GracoRoberts\n“When we were engaged in due diligence to purchase an eCommerce company, I was introduced to Rick Watson by one of my Board of Directors to help swiftly identify any red flags. Rick and his team focused on exactly what we needed and met the tight timelines that due diligence often requires.  Furthermore, his firm's analysis identified one important issue that we had missed entirely up to that time.  I would definitely work with RMW Commerce again in the future.”\n\"They have helped us better frame how we approach and sell to enterprise clients\"\n-\n\"Rick is a thought leader in eCommerce.\"\n-\n\"Astounding depth of knowledge and relationships in e-commerce, SaaS and B2B enterprise technology.\"\n-\n\"Rick has deep insights into the world of eCommerce, shipping and logistics.\"\n\"They have helped us better frame how we approach and sell to enterprise clients\"\n-\n\"Rick is a thought leader in eCommerce.\"\n-\n\"Astounding depth of knowledge and relationships in e-commerce, SaaS and B2B enterprise technology.\"\n-\n\"Rick has deep insights into the world of eCommerce, shipping and logistics.\"\n\"They have helped us better frame how we approach and sell to enterprise clients\" - \"Rick is a thought leader in eCommerce.\" - \"Astounding depth of knowledge and relationships in e-commerce, SaaS and B2B enterprise technology.\" - \"Rick has deep insights into the world of eCommerce, shipping and logistics.\"\nAs Seen In\nHow Can an E-commerce Consultant Improve Your Business?\nFeatured\nConsulting, eCommerce, eCommerce Consulting\nWhat was H2 Brands’ Mission for RMW Commerce?\nConsulting, eCommerce, eCommerce Consulting\nHear from Nick Pendrous of H2 Brands, as he describes his experience working with RMW Commerce Consulting: The mission was simple — audit the company’s eCommerce infrastructure from end to end, with a particular focus on Amazon 3P marketplace,  helping the company understand areas of relative weakness and strength.\nConsulting, eCommerce, eCommerce Consulting\nStrategic Planning, eCommerce Consulting\nWhat Is The Best Checklist for Your eCommerce Strategy?

Then You Need More Than Simple Label Printing.\nGone are the days of relying on a single parcel carrier to handle all your deliveries. Higher shipping costs, omnichannel fulfillment, and customers demand for faster, flexible, and free delivery options are making shippers diversify their carrier service offering. But deciding how, when, and where to use those carrier services has become increasingly complex.Finally, there is a way to automate intelligent decision-making throughout your fulfillment processes: Sendflex Parcel TMS.\nLEARN MORE ABOUT SENDFLEX SOLUTIONS\nCOMPLEXITY SIMPLIFIED\nSendflex Parcel TMS Adds a Data-driven Layer of Intelligence to Your Shipping Processes\nSure, legacy shipping systems do a good job weighing, rating and label printing. But with costs and complexity increasing that isn’t enough anymore. Sendflex’s Parcel TMS platform enables you to diversify your carrier network and automate cost-effective decision-making in eCommerce storefronts, order allocation, fulfillment, and, of course, shipping and returns.Best of all, Sendflex’s no-code wizards enable managers to configure and apply instructions to orders to reduce cost and waste, while optimizing capacity and customer delivery experiences. Use Sendflex instructions to run “what if” simulations against historical shipping data. And then easily re-configure instructions to adapt your operations to changing business conditions. No more costly programming and long project timelines.\nLEARN MORE ABOUT THE SENDFLEX PLATFORM\nCONTROL COSTS, CAPACITY, CARBON, AND CUSTOMERS DELIVERY EXPERIENCES\nHow Sendflex Works for You\nDiversified Carrier Network\nWith eCommerce still in its early growth stage (only 19% of retail), parcel volumes are expected to double in the next two years. That means you need a more resilient carrier network to reduce the risk of delivery disruptions. Our powerful optimization engine makes it easy to manage our extensive network of final mile carriers.\nSuperfast Carrier Rating\nWhen you are quoting delivery costs in shopping carts, optimizing plans, or running simulation models, you don’t have time to “ping” carrier rating APIs. They are too slow and unreliable, and carriers are starting to levy surcharges for overuse. Sendflex Parcel TMS features an onboard rating engine that will accurately calculate over 20,000 rates per second.\nOptimized Carrier Selection\nSendflex enables you to configure instructions to simplify complex carrier service selection processes based not only on carrier rates, but also on transit time, shipment attributes (SKU size, fragility, hazmat, order value, etc.), carrier performance (on-time delivery, damage, etc.), DIM factors, customer preferences, and more.\nCarrier Contract Compliance\nThe gap between expected shipping costs and actual invoice costs is widening. That’s because rating is becoming increasingly dynamic and complex with incentive tiers, surcharges, and daily pickup limits. Sendflex monitors shipping activity in real time and automatically controls routing to alternative carrier services based on your primary carrier commitments.\nOptimize Cartonization\nUnexpected dimensional weight adjustments on carrier invoices are eating into shippers’ margins. Sendflex automates transportation cost-effective packing by applying cartonization algorithms and rules to reduce dimensional fees, waste, corrugated costs, and ensure a better customer sustainability experience.\n“What if” Simulations\nIT professionals have “sandboxes” to test new programs and technology. Sendflex Simulator enables logistics managers to test the cost and service impact of their decisions against historical data. Ex: “What if I had used a regional carrier last November?”, “What if I had fulfilled these orders from a different location?”, “What if I had used different sized cartons?”.\nPOWERFUL RESULTS\nSendflex Makes Everyone a Winner\nLogistics\nAutomate data-driven decisions to expand capacity, control shipping costs, and make and keep your delivery promises using a more diverse carrier network.\nIT\nReduce cost of ownership and time to benefit with secure, cloud-native deployments. No-code configurations and connectors eliminate long IT project timelines and costs.\nFinance\nNo upfront license fees and minimal pro service costs. Only pay for what your organization needs to use with no hidden costs.\nMarketing & Sales\nTake the guesswork out of freight quoting. Instantly calculate rating and time in transit for more carrier options in shopping carts. Make and keep your customer delivery promises.\nCarriers\nUse Sendflex Simulator to prove your service’s cost savings and delivery improvements compared with your customer’s existing carrier historical performance.\nShipping System Vendors\nEnhance your offering by minimizing complex, inflexible scripting, and long IT project timelines. Sendflex shifts control of business rules from IT to logistics managers.\nLEARN\nDownloadThe Case forParcel TMS Simulators\nEBOOK\nHow Intelligent Packing and Parcel Optimization Rules Reduce Margin Erosion, Carbon Emissions, and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nDiscover how Sendflex and Paccurate's combined technologies optimize every stage of the order-to-delivery process, significantly improving margins and sustainability.

Fill in your information and we will be in touch to schedule a demo.       Ready to talk now?Contact Us: (805) 335-2432  ShipHawk’s Company Culture: The Three H’sShare:April 3, 2015 / Claire EastburnShipHawk’s Company Culture: The Three H’sThe first thing you see when you walk through the doors at ShipHawk are the three H’s: Heart, Hustle, Humility. As Tony Hsieh, the CEO of Zappo’s said, “Your brand is your culture.” Every day at ShipHawk we strive to embody these values. They are reflected in our work, office environment, and brand identity.HeartYour work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.—Steve Jobs Always doing what is in the customer’s best interest. We do whatever it takes to keep our customers happy. Our company culture and brand identity are a reflection of who we are as individuals, where we strive to be, and what makes ShipHawk different.Caring about the customer and all our Team Members. Customers will always be treated with respect, keeping the Golden Rule in mind. ShipHawk Team Members are a family, first and foremost. These relationships extend beyond the office, where we get to know one another on a deeper level.Communicating profoundly and deeply. One of the biggest pain points for our customers is the lack of communication when dealing with the shipping industry. To help our customers, we strive to communicate effectively and efficiently. We move beyond the surface of just asking questions by learning our customers’ stories.Having fun! Work hard, play hard. It may be work but that doesn’t mean we can’t have fun doing it. We laugh, play, prank, compete, and push each other to have fun with what we do. We have fun with our customers and have fun with one another.HustleThings may come to those who wait, but only the things left by those who hustle.—Abraham LincolnKeeping up the intensity. We are fiercely competitive and always demanding more of ourselves, our vendors, and our partners. With such high expectations of ourselves and those around us, we know they demand the same of us.Being clever. We find unique ways to solve complex problems by delivering creative solutions through our technology and customer service.Living a healthy and active lifestyle. Health is a vital part of keeping the hustle alive. By staying physically active, monitoring nutrition, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance, we are able to stay healthy, happy, and strong.Staying educated. Knowledge is power. In order to stay ahead of the curve, we learn about the latest trends in our industry. One can never know too much, so we strive to read, research, and take the initiative to become active minds and learners.HumilityHumility is the solid foundation of all virtues.—ConfuciusOwning mistakes. We admit to our failures. Turning a mistake into a lesson requires fixing it, learning from it, and developing a plan to prevent it from happening again.    Being open and honest. Everyone has their limits; it’s better to under-promise and over-deliver. Staying honest with our customers, Team Members, and ourselves keeps us grounded. If a task is too much, we get help. If we don’t know an answer, we’ll find it.Whether it’s having the heart to create innovative programming, hustling to finish a project on time, or having humility when confronted with an unhappy customer, every department and person at ShipHawk permeates the three H’s—heart, hustle, humility.TAGS: Company Culture , Heart , Humility , Hustle , ValuesPost navigation< NEWER  OLDER >Recent postsRenew Wellness Brands uses ShipHawk to reduce errorsRenew Wellness Brands uses ShipHawk to keep up with peak seasonThe Growth Playbook: How to Scale Systems for High-Growth Product-Focused Companies10 Competencies of Best-In-Class WarehousesCapture Weights & Dims, Cut Costs with ShipHawk Dimensioner         © ShipHawk 2024, All Rights Reserved     Fulfillment Management SolutionsWarehouse Management SystemReceive, Putaway, & Cross-DockPick OptimizationCycle CountShipping SoftwarePacking OptimizationShipping Rate OptimizationShipping APIShopping Cart Shipping SoftwareParcel & Freight AuditShipHawk DimensionerERP IntegrationsNetSuite – WMSNetSuite – ShippingAcumatica – WMSAcumatica – ShippingInfor – WMSInfor – ShippingMicrosoft Dynamics – WMSMicrosoft Dynamics – ShippingSage – WMSSage – ShippingSAP – WMSSAP – ShippingResourcesResources, Events and WebinarsCustomer StoriesBlogShipping CarriersAbout UsCareersSystem StatusContact UsPressPrivacy Policy    [brb_collection id=\"14947\"]",

Since then, it has felt like the speed of advancement has accelerated every year, leaving virtually everyone else behind.After college I bought a small pack and ship store where I found myself right in the middle of this global transformation. Shipping software was old, the results were unpredictable, and my customers were counting on me to have all the answers. My phone was literally ringing off the hook with customers asking me the same question, \"What is the shipping cost?\"Most of today's shippers find that their second highest expense, second only to cost-of-goods, is shipping! Yet they are entering each transaction blind. They have inaccurate data and their entry-level shipping software lacks the controls they need to impact these costs. ShipHawk was founded to level the playing field, to give control back to the shippers, the retailers, manufacturers, and distributors who need these levers to stay competitive.The stakes have never been higher. Our mission is to create a world where shipping positively impacts society without thrashing workers, our environment, or the bottom line.Today we do this by focusing on warehouse automations specifically around parcel and LTL order fulfillment, but we won't stop building until our customers have equal access to enterprise-level efficiencies throughout the supply chain.Jeremy Bodenhamer Co-founder & CEOREAD MOREOur History2012ShipHawk is Founded ShipHawk was founded on October 16, 2012.2013TechCrunch DisruptShipHawk won the Audience Choice Award at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2013.2015Kyiv Office OpenedIn May 2015, ShipHawk opened an office in Kyiv.2017SDCE Green Supply Chain AwardIn 2017, ShipHawk won the Green Supply Chain Award by Supply and Demand Chain Executive.2017Deloitte Technology Fast 500In 2017, ShipHawk ranked #8 on Deloitte's Technology Fast 500.2017 and 2018 Inc. 5000ShipHawk ranked #12 on the 2017 Inc. 5000.ShipHawk ranked #192 on the 2018 Inc. 5000. 2012ShipHawk is Founded ShipHawk was founded on October 16, 2012.2013TechCrunch DisruptShipHawk won the Audience Choice Award at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2013.2015Kyiv Office OpenedIn May 2015, ShipHawk opened an office in Kyiv.2017SDCE Green Supply Chain AwardIn 2017, ShipHawk won the Green Supply Chain Award by Supply and Demand Chain Executive.2017Deloitte Technology Fast 500In 2017, ShipHawk ranked #8 on Deloitte's Technology Fast 500.2017 and 2018 Inc. 5000ShipHawk ranked #12 on the 2017 Inc. 5000.ShipHawk ranked #192 on the 2018 Inc. 5000. 2012ShipHawk is Founded ShipHawk was founded on October 16, 2012.2013TechCrunch DisruptShipHawk won the Audience Choice Award at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2013.2015Kyiv Office OpenedIn May 2015, ShipHawk opened an office in Kyiv.2017SDCE Green Supply Chain AwardIn 2017, ShipHawk won the Green Supply Chain Award by Supply and Demand Chain Executive.2017Deloitte Technology Fast 500In 2017, ShipHawk ranked #8 on Deloitte's Technology Fast 500.2017 and 2018 Inc. 5000ShipHawk ranked #12 on the 2017 Inc. 5000.ShipHawk ranked #192 on the 2018 Inc. 5000.

Rather, it is a useful addition when street addresses are not accurate enough, and an instant, scalable solution where addresses do not exist.\nCompared to current street addressing systems, 3 word addresses are far more accurate, as they refer to a specific 3m x 3m area. As the entire what3words grid is fixed, the 3 word address for a particular location will never change even if buildings or streets are redeveloped.\n3 word addresses are unique, unlike street names which are often duplicated, and they are easier to communicate and share with others.\nwhat3words is much faster to set up and more cost-efficient than any regular street addressing system, as every 3 word address has already been pre-assigned, providing an instant, scalable solution.\nwhat3words is the only addressing system optimised for voice, making it the ideal location system for the voice-enabled solutions of the future.\nwhat3words AutoSuggest prompts intelligent suggestions based on the user’s location, making it a truly human friendly solution.\nWhy did you use three words?\nTo make what3words precise enough to refer to an entrance or parking spot, it needed to be accurate to a 3m square. This meant we needed 57 trillion addresses to cover the world, and three words allowed us to create 64 trillion addresses – covering the entire world with quite a few spare! If we’d used only two words, we’d only have had enough for 1.6 billion squares.\nCan I type a what3words address into Google Maps?\nOn a smartphone, simply enter the what3words address into the free what3words app, then tap ‘Navigate’ and select ‘Google Maps’ to open the location in Google Maps.\nDoes the what3words app work without signal?\nWithout phone signal, the app functions the same as when you have no data connection: you can view the location of any what3words address you enter. You can also navigate to it using compass mode.\nTo share a what3words address over the phone or in a text message you need phone signal. To load maps, or share in other apps or social media, you need a data connection.\nWatch our CEO Chris explain how what3words works offline\nhere.\nSee all FAQs\nFollow us\nSign up to receive our latest updates",

South Orlando is lucky to have a successful startup here who is invested in the community and actively working to keep our quality-of-life index high.”\nNick Poole, JLL Orlando Managing Director\nFreon frustration leads to startup inspiration.\nAnyone who knows Bill knows that the inspiration for OneRail began with a refrigerator. To hear the full story, listen to his interview on the What the Truck? podcast, live from the 3PL Summit.\nWhile brainstorming on what makes OneRail unique in the early days, Bill found that each of his bullet points began with the word one. Since the beginning, he set out to make deliveries run like a financial transaction, with many stakeholder and partners virtually shaking hands in milliseconds. With that in mind, the word rail became evident, a term frequently used to describe payment rails.\nTeam OneRail Delivers\nStrengthening our community is built into our daily work. What we achieve where we are headquartered in Orlando means a great deal to us, because our success is the City of Orlando’s success. As we grow, we aim to be instrumental in helping the Orlando community continue to achieve excellence in job growth.\nEvery month in Orlando, as well as in our offices in North Carolina and Atlanta, Team OneRail dedicates time and resources to build resiliency in the places we call home.\nHead over to our Team OneRail Delivers page to see our community involvement in action.\nHear from our team about working  at OneRail, in their own words.\nWatch the Video\nLast Mile, Delivered.\ninfo@onerail.io\n(407) 792-6327\nPlatform\nDelivery Order Automation\nMultimodal Optimization\nAutomated Rate Shopping\nReal-time Last Mile Delivery Tracking\nCustomer Experience\nActionable Data\nResources\nResource Center\nBlog\nNewsroom\nCompany\nTrust Center\nAbout\nLeadership\nPartnerships\nCareers\nContact Us\nSupport\nLegal\nTerms\nPrivacy Notice\n© 2024 OneRail.

จากนั้นให้คิดต่อยอดไปที่เรื่องของผลกำไรในวันนั้นเท่ากับอัตราที่ได้เสีย เพราะนั่นคือ ผลกำไรที่แท้จริง มันแสดงออกถึงความสำเร็จขั้นต้น หากมองเพียงแค่เม็ดเงินอาจจะดูน้อยเกินไป แต่มองอีกมุมนึง

Saltbox gets 5 stars!\"Sarak LeskoExecutive Director\"Saltbox is more than just a space to do business out of, it’s a space for community, inspiration, support, and motivation! The Saltbox team has provided us with the support needed to help us focus on scaling, expanding our offerings, and streamlining our processes.\"Katherine DunnFounder\"Saltbox really enables us to flex up when needed without having to take on undue amounts of costs and hiring employees. If it wasn't for them, we would have made expensive mistakes and just been Googling random things to figure out how to best capitalize on high-traffic ecommerce events.\"Brea FullertonFounder & CEO\"Before I found Saltbox my entire condo, garage, and spare bedroom at my parents' house was lined with boxes and garbage bags full of inventory and I didnt know how to even open and sort thru everything. When I went looking for options for a storage and/or work location for my business, Saltbox not only offered me space at a reasonable rate but they host small business crash-courses on-site and have so many answers to logistics I didn't even know I was going to encounter as I started really scaling my business. I absolutely love the staff at my location and the flexibility they offer for scaling up or down is such a mental relief. I love being a member at Saltbox!\"Michelle MildredFounder\"One of my favorite features with Parsel is its ability to batch orders. We ship out a lot of orders with Good Morning America and other large-scale media opportunities, and it's inevitable that we'll miss a batch in our fulfillment queue. Parsel's notifications made it easy to find what missing orders needed attention and allowed us to quickly recitify that so that we were still within our contracted ship window.\"Brea FullertonFounder & CEO“As a small business, it’s easy to focus on market growth. However, operational challenges and associated costs often distract from this focus.

Mindful Mobility is how we provide a seamless experience across North America, resulting in significant pricing advantages without sacrificing quality. We are focused on disrupting the logistics industry with our business model and technology platform—we prioritize core values, innovation, and exceptional service.At Ziing, we don't operate with a mission. We're driven by a sense of purpose. We think of mobility as a breeding ground for collective change. We saw an opportunity to be the first logistics company that didn't just integrate digital technology into our operations we founded our entire business upon it. Harnessing the power of data, integrated systems, clean technology, and Al-driven automation, we help our clients deliver on their promise of excellent customer service.\nGet in Touch\nLocal Experts, Customized Network\nZiing transcends traditional logistics, acting as a trusted partner in streamlining delivery experiences. Leveraging local expertise, cutting-edge technology, and a widespread North American network, Ziing strives to customize and simplify the world of logistics. Combining human expertise with data-driven automation, Ziing offers a hassle-free, fully transparent, and highly customizable mobility ecosystem.\nZiing’s Core Values\nHumble\nMindful\nHungry\nFuture-Forward Technology, Powered by ziing.ai\nZiing leads the charge in logistics innovation, fusing fleet operations, a Transportation Management System(TMS), and a Warehouse Management System (WMS) into a potent “Mindful Mobility System” called ziing.ai.\nZiing.ai harnesses Generative AI, cloud, and mobile technologies to streamline operations, ensuring efficient driver management, precise asset tracking, seamless package handling, real-time client interaction, and holistic integration, culminating in a truly unparalleled logistics experience.\nChampioning Collaboration\nIn the dynamic world of logistics, Ziing is the driving force that passionately fosters connections between clients and a network of service partners with existing assets. We’re more than just catalysts; we’re collaborators on a shared platform. Our aim is a consistent and seamless experience, whether partnering with a single service provider or orchestrating a symphony of collaborations across different markets in North America.\nZero-Emission Deliveries\nNearly 80% percent of consumers agree that a sustainable lifestyle is important. A sustainable mindset helps us all reduce waste, better manage our energy consumption, and reduce our carbon footprint. At Ziing, zero-emission vehicles, coupled with technology that drives efficiency, reduce GHG emissions and help create profitable environmental solutions. To learn more about our sustainability initiatives.\nLearn more\nThe Business Case for Sustainable Transportation\nProtect the planet or boost your bottom line. Not so long ago, businesses felt that they had to choose—and their sustainability goals often lost out. Now, we can debunk the myth once and for all. Purpose and profit can get along together.\nOptimized Routing Coupled With the Right Asset\nRoute Optimization is the first step in realizing great service levels, cost efficiency, and reducing your carbon footprint. The second step is to find the right asset on the road.Route Optimization, simply put, is the fewest kilometres in the shortest window. It’s about maximizing density—the fewest kilometres between stops. One or two additional kilometres between stops may not seem like much. Multiply those extra kilometres across thousands of stops and many vehicles, and suddenly, the carbon footprint has grown exponentially. Ziing’s optimization maximizes your density and minimizes your carbon footprint.The right asset aligns the proper vehicles for the requirements to serve your customer. Many carriers, if not most, will utilize the assets available in their fleet. Using a cube van when a small passenger car is sufficient creates an unnecessarily larger carbon footprint and drives costs higher. Ziing’s Service Partner model utilizes the right asset to meet your economic needs and minimizes the subsequent carbon\nZero Emissions & Alternative Fuels\nThe future will be powered by two equally important pathways: Clean power and clean fuels. Additionally, many regions will require a minimum percentage of vehicles to have zero emissions by 2026, increasing generally to 50% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. In other words, the transition is necessary.EVs are clearly making their mark and are especially efficient with shorter, dense routes in smaller assets. Sometimes, we forget about alternative fuels, like hydrogen. Hydrogen is powering larger assets over longer routes and gaining traction.*We are seeing market forces from several directions:\nConsumer awareness: More and more customers are concerned about the environment.\nGovernment regulation: CFR, LCFS, IRA, Zero Emissions Zones, Commercial Fleet Mandates, Compliance & Emissions Reporting\nSignificant incentive programs for Climate Action & Cleantech—e.g., grants, tax rebates, carbon markets, and other funding initiatives generate economic feasibility.\nIncreasingly more compelling economics for Zero Emissions Vehicles & Low-Carbon Fuels\nCarbon-Neutral Deliveries\nNot every delivery can be performed with a Zero Emission Vehicle. What if your customer requires service in a timely manner that requires an asset that simply cannot be Zero Emissions?Does this necessitate a heavier carbon footprint? Absolutely not.Ziing can align your organization with reputable Carbon Offsets. By investing in Carbon Offsets, you can completely negate your once-necessary carbon footprint and still meet the required service levels for your customer.Ziing is here to help you synchronize your service levels and reduce your carbon footprint.\nCapitalize on Low-Carbon Incentives\nInvesting in clean technology is not purely an expensive experience. Government incentives can reduce the asset cost, and revenue opportunities exist in the form of Carbon Credits.Any carrier can leverage government incentives to reduce the asset cost of a new EV, often at the point of purchase. Carbon Credits are where you turn your electrified fleet into an additional revenue stream.When you own the charging network, such as having chargers at your facility, Ziing will develop your Carbon Credits and market them on your behalf, thereby creating annual revenue streams of Carbon Credit Income. Each Province and State has their own programs in addition to Federal Incentives, and Ziing can do the complex work for you. You get the reduced operating costs and brand recognition of a green fleet and also improve the return on your asset.A green fleet and Carbon Credits epitomize a “win-win” situation for all involved.\nMeet the Team\nWe were founded by supply chain and technology experts.

The human element, Premonition claims, is worth an average 30.70% increase in win rate, which translates to substantial savings for clients.”\n“Law has historically been a credence good. This means the market relies on elite credentials and firm reputation as a proxy for skill.”\nProfessor William Henderson, Maurer School of Law\n“I do not have to tell you the significant and revolutionary role Premonition.ai is playing in altering the landscape of the profession.”\nProfessor Michael Hunter Schwartz, University of Arkansas at Little Rock\n“Like other disruptive technologies, Premonition has the capacity to completely recalibrate the way in which clients instruct legal professionals and legal professionals instruct each other.”\n“For our legal financing opportunities, Premonition delivers a quantitative analysis of legal risks that is unique and provides invaluable insight.”\nAdrian Chopin, ORCHARD GLOBAL Asset Management LLP\n“Told my attorney she had a great record in front of Judge Doherty and the Plaintiffs Counsel did not. She was floored I had the information and where I got it from… allowed us to move forward and focus on the case and the strategy around the case.”\nRyan Fitzgerald, President, Spring Creek Development Group\n“We constantly search for tools to bring transparency to the Courts and success in our legal battles. The most powerful analytical technology we’ve come across in the litigation arena is Premonition. It is the most cost-effective analytical tool ever invented.”\nEnlightened Zebra Society\n“The most vital factor in Litigation is your Counsel’s prior Win Rate before your Judge. Premonition is the only company that has that data. If you have to hire an Attorney, why not hire a great one?”\nBenjamin Wolkow, ESQ. General Counsel\n“General Counsel can’t hire a big firm and hope anymore. It’s vital to know your Litigator’s Win Rate.”\nRichard Waserstein ESQ.

Kudos to you and her!Dave GarciaA Texas-based company with Texas employees, providing stellar Texas-friendly service on a daily basis. I use LSO three times a week and usually, everything gets to its destination on time or early, but the important part is that, if something goes wrong, I can reach a live person almost instantly and they always stay with my problem until it’s solved.

I am extremely pleased with the service that our company received. Kevin first communicated with another employee from my company. I was then given Kevin's contact information and quote. Within the hour, everything was all set up, and within less than 2 hours - the item was picked up from the warehouse and on its way to the customer. Kevin was very professional, thorough in his communication, and very friendly and pleasant to speak with on the phone. I will definitely be doing business with them again in the future!!\nAffiliated Water\nWonderful experience — Kevin Carpenter is a fabulous customer service rep. We needed the services for an URGENT IMMEDIATE SITUATION. He and his team jumped right on it and got everything taken care of very quickly and so professionally. We made our deadline time even with lots of hiccups on the pickup location and they still came through. I would recommend this company to anyone.\nLisa Carter\nSun-Maid Growers of California\nWow is all I can say! Found you through Google. Filled out the online request and received a PROMPT reply. The quote was received quickly. We were able to book with you faster than we had anticipated. BOL was also provided - saving us time and hassle. And the shipment status was relayed to us throughout its journey. The pick up driver was courteous and the custom van was rigged to slide a palletized shipment in effortlessly! And talk about good old fashioned customer service — it is alive and well with your employees! Thank you Chris Noe!!! You are the BOMB! I know who we will call if we ever need a \"hot shot\" shipment service again! Thank you for having your \"act\" together with your service!\nColumbus Fan & Machine Corp.\nI had an emergency shipment that needed a non-stop hot shot delivery run from Texas to California and they were able to get it picked up from the warehouse within one hour of me calling. I worked with Justin P., and received great service and communication, and these guys are awesome in a rush. Everything went smoothly and delivery was made right on time. Would recommend!\nThomson Air Conditioning\nAn absolute lifesaver. Steve was a dream to work with. I phoned him after leaving our passports in a Las Vegas hotel and needed a same day pick up and delivery to Los Angeles in order to make our flight home that night back to New Zealand. Dealing with some very unhelpful Hotel staff, Steve's fantastic driver diligently located and collected my items and swiftly had them to me personally at our Los Angeles Hotel lobby. I am extremely grateful to have found a company who were able to help me out of a very stressful situation. They are caring, professional and I would highly recommend using them.\nMag & Turbo\nBest service for product transport and delivery! Kevin was in touch with me via text constantly with updates and responses as soon as I sent them! He got me the highlight piece for a wedding overnight from New York to San Francisco, CA! Something no one was willing to guarantee! He made sure I got my delivery done at night, when I even gave him leeway for an early morning delivery if it came to it! I mean this company and especially Kevin are amazing! And really really came through! Plus they were reasonable as compared to FedEx and UPS! And much much MUCH easier and more personal to work with! I didn't have to talk to hear a computer or navigate through a pre-automated answering service!

Dan Boaz, an entrepreneur with a strong personal connection to the transportation industry, founded both SameDayDelivery.com and its parent organization, AirFreight.com. He came up with the strategy behind these organizations’ success, basing it on his experience with:\nTruck Driving- Dan started his career back in 1985 as a package car driver driving for UPS. He thus has a keen sense of exactly what it’s like to be a driver, in addition to which resources are needed to help drivers do their jobs most effectively. Dan understands how important it is for a driver to get his deliveries made on-time, have access to well maintained and reliable vehicles, and have backup from a driver support team. Dan makes sure his drivers have all of this, so they are able to operate safely and effectively on any job.\nLogistics Management- After working as a truck driver, Dan took a management position at UPS, and later had a similar position with Associated Global Systems. This gives him additional insight into the opportunities and constraints of a delivery service. Not only does he know what it’s like to be a driver, but he understands the challenges that managers face responding to drivers’ needs. He is thus able to take both perspectives into account when planning for success.\nThe Rise of the Internet- Given the timing of his career, Dan has observed the Internet throughout its history. He saw how shipping businesses and other companies tried to take advantage of it, what opportunities it created, and what problems it caused. Based on this, he came up with a plan to use the Internet for coordinating shipping services. By connecting customers to trucks and planes using a series of online platforms, he can make complex, quick deliveries without needing to buy any vehicles directly. In this way, he has raised the efficiency and effectiveness of modern shipping.\nSameDayDelivery.com represents the culmination of this experience. By taking into accounts the needs of drivers, the challenges of management, and the opportunities of the Internet, Dan has created a company that can ship pallets, machinery, equipment, and a variety of other large freight items in record time.\nServices\nLocations\nResource Center\nBlog\nBecome An Agent\nAbout Us\nTestimonials\nContact Us\n© 2023 SameDayDelivery.com.

Lanter® played aggressively and successfully in that space until it became a purely price- driven marketplace, dominated by a handful of extremely large corporate players. By the end of that decade, we decided it was time to find a new approach for growing our business.\nThe opportunity we were looking for opened up in 1995, when Lanter® was approached by one of the nation’s largest agricultural manufacturers. They were looking to solve a complex logistics problem that their current provider wasn’t addressing. Lanter’s® team of experts went to work, and the overnight, unattended delivery solution was born.  We rapidly created a distribution network that guaranteed the overnight delivery of parts by 8:00 A.M. After a successful launch, the program expanded to Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas, NE regions and beyond.\nThe overnight, unattended delivery solution spawned what has become known as the Lanter® Shared Network. This is a logistics system that gives us tremendous flexibility and efficiency when crafting a custom solution for our clients. It allows the use of both dedicated and shared services to exceed client expectations and increase productivity.\nIn the late 1990’s, we brought this proven, road-tested solution to the auto industry. Our success in that field has established Lanter® as a premier overnight, unattended delivery solution provider in the transportation and logistics industry.Lanter Delivery Systems® is the classic American business story. Starting in 1981 with one man and truck, we have grown to become a major player in the country’s supply chain serving businesses nationwide.Play VideoFacebookTwitterPinterestTumblrCopy LinkLink CopiedToday, our business demands efficiencies in cost and logistics combined with unmatched quality and reliability.Lanter’s® strategic, process-driven approach has been embraced by the marketplace, and it is setting new service standards for the automotive, agricultural, heavy industrial, and heavy trucking industries.\nWe now have a nationwide footprint, operating in every state throughout the continental U.S., and there’s no place we can’t go to meet the logistical needs of virtually any type of business.  That achievement is a tribute to the value we prize above all else – building deep, enduring relationships with our Lanter team and our customers.We see a bright future on the road before us, and we are looking forward to bringing our proven solutions to many new industries. We will continue to build long lasting relationships as we push ahead and live by the culture embodied in our Non-Negotiables.SERVICE OFFERINGS–  Night Unattended Delivery\n–  Scheduled LTL (less than a truckload)\n–  Pool DistributionINDUSTRIES WE SERVE:–  Automotive\n–  Agricultural\n–  Heavy Trucking\n–  IndustrialVISIT US13075 Manchester Road\nSuite 300\nDes Peres, MO 63131© 2024 Lanter Delivery Systems, LLC®.Designed by Cairo DesignPRIVACY POLICYbottom of page",

I had never hired a courier service before and needed to deliver some equipment that I couldn’t fit in my car. These guys were prompt, professional, and friendly. The courier picked up and delivered all within under an hour. Definitely wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them.Steve W.Our company needed to transport pallets and large crates for a trade show that was a few states away due to a last minute shipping hiccup, so we were on a tight deadline. California Courier Services arranged a cargo van to come and pick up my pallets and boxes and delivered it to the trade show in time for us to set up. Thanks again guys.Michael B.We used these guys to transport some medical samples after our regular courier dropped the ball. They arrived earlier than expected and delivered the samples way quicker than our usual courier. We have since switched over to using California Courier Services for all of our medical sample and specimen deliveries. 5 stars!Annete F.I needed a same day filing in district court, and unfortunately the lawyer responsible for it wanted the most amount of time to complete it before filing. I called California Courier Services and they printed up my filing and then took it to the clerk of courts and had it filed in under an hour, during rush hour traffic. For any legal filings I couldn’t recommend them anymore.Mason W.I’m beyond impressed with how quick California Courier Services responded to my request and completed it. I had a bit of an unusual request after FedEx messed up my shipment on the weekend, and they were there to pick up my package and deliver it in a fast manner. I was surprised since they were one of the only couriers that were still open on the weekends and managed to complete my delivery in a faster time than they originally promised.Kim W.My company shipped a large pallet same day air through one of the airlines at to the airport. The freight weighed 1000 lbs and needed special delivery that required a box truck with a lift gate. Luckily, California Courier Services managed to get it taken care of and delivered to my customer in time. Would totally use them again and recommend everyone else to use them too.Trisha F.Amazing service and they have never missed a deadline every time we have used them. Their customer service always follows up and is super helpful. For a courier service I wouldn’t use any other company.Nathan B.My company uses them for all of our STAT medical deliveries. We are talking samples, devices, trays with equipment that need cleaning, and implants and we have never had any complaints. Not only do these guys follow through with every order they also make sure all of our deliveries get the highest priority which means that our STAT orders aren’t waiting for a driver to come by to pick up and deliver.Daniel S.I am an out of town but needed some paperwork to be delivered to one of our clients and signed off on and then shipped back to me. I contacted California Courier Services and they not only got the job done right (even though their driver had to wait a bit more at the client’s place than expected) they also kept their promise and made sure everything got taken care of and sent back. I even received a digital copy of the document right away. Amazing courier service and if I need their services again I wouldn’t hesitate to use them.Amanda I.We needed to have some medical equipment delivered from our location to a major California hospital, and contacted a bunch of couriers who quoted us ridiculous rates and said they couldn’t guarantee it would be delivered on time. This was for immediate use by the hospital by the way. California Courier Services picked up the phone on me and reassured me it would not only get delivered on time but also much cheaper than I was quoted everywhere else. They not only delivered on their promises, they also received a life time client and we now use them for all of our deliveries.AVAILABLE 24/7/365Our ServicesCalifornia Courier Services has rush delivery and courier services to meet your every need.

While a quote may appear inexpensive, what are the hidden costs to you, your company, and your customers? …How can you limit the frequency of these unwanted expenses?Learn more by exploring the insights below.missing freightWhy do carriers lose my freight?Other carriers use the same barcode on each piece of your shipment. When pieces go missing, they’re difficult to locate because each scan looks identical. In contrast, our TRUETRAKTM system assigns a unique barcode to each handling unit. This gives us more precise tracking so you have fewer headaches with missing freight.Start Shipping With UsDamaged freight Why do carriers damage my freight?Reasons a carrier might damage your freight.1Load CapacityEvery carrier tries to maximize load capacity (cubic space and weight), as they should-- it's fiscally and environmentally responsible. What sets carriers apart is their technique in pursuing this target. Many stack freight directly on top of your product or try to cram freight into tight spaces.We securely mount freight onto load bars, avoiding the potential of crushing freight beneath it. This precaution helps us fill trailer volume while reducing damage so we can deliver freight to your customer instead of a landfill.2CultureHuman error accounts for a portion of unintentional damage by carriers. How well does your carrier manage the frequency and severity of this human error?We carefully hire like-minded individuals who have a balanced attitude towards safety, quality, and productivity. Then we give them the tools and training to successfully protect your product in a fast-paced LTL environment.3PackagingLTL freight is handled many times in transit and shares trailer space with various other commodities. Packaging your product adequately to withstand the rigors of LTL shipping will reduce the likelihood of damage. Some of the most common packaging oversights are freight that overhangs the pallet, unprotected loose freight, product that's not properly secured to the pallet, and top-heavy freight with an insufficient base.We dislike claims just as much as shippers. Damage not only involves freight but also injures reputations and relationships. Our Sales and Operations team members can provide valuable input while partnering with you to protect your product.Start Shipping With UsDelayed freight Why do carriers delay my freight?There are three main reasons carriers delay your fright.1Low Route DensityMost carriers only deliver to rural locations when they have enough freight built up, leaving your customer wondering when or if they'll receive their shipment. For predictability, our remote points get a scheduled service day, so customers know exactly when to expect their freight. In addition, our high-density coverage allows us to service rural locations more frequently and consistently than competitors.2MisroutesAnother reason freight could get delayed is misrouting. Human error while loading trailers is unavoidable. Generally, carriers catch these errors once freight reaches the incorrect terminal which often causes your freight to be delayed multiple days.Through use of barcode scanning on our docks, if freight is initially misloaded, system alerts notify us immediately. This allows us to correct the mistake before it becomes a service issue.3Lane CapacityYour freight could also be delayed due to lane capacity. When carriers see an influx in requests, your freight may not receive top priority, causing your shipment to be held until capacity becomes available.Two-thirds of our customers submit requests electronically. Our drivers also send electronic versions of BOLs while on their route. This allows us to see early indicators of heavy lanes with time to react and adjust capacity when possible.Start Shipping With Ustruckloadsolutions thatdeliver results tailored solutions   •   dedicated service   •   trusted partnersWe've expanded See Our Locations\nNew ShipmentsQuoteQuick Pick UpSet-Up ShipmentsAddress BookShippedTrack A ShipmentShipping HistoryEmail AlertsFile a ClaimInvoices‍Shipping PortalResourcesTransit TimesLocationsPoints LIst XLSPoints List PDFDensity CalculatorRules TariffTerms of UseAccessorial ChargesFormsFuel SurchargeHoliday ScheduleAPI/EDI DocumentationTeam ResourcesPrivacy PolicyAboutWho We AreLocationsNewsCareersOpen PositionsWhy Join Us?ContactPhone: (800) 521-0287cs@ccfs.com©CrossCountry Freight SolutionsREVIEW US ON FOLLOW US ONShipping Portal / Log InNew to our online tools?

The cost of transport was very reasonable too!\nRebekah B. Said:\nGreat, No Hassle Service\nThis is a great service. We booked online and the request was accepted within minutes. A few hours later our driver picked up our couch at Home Sense with no issues and delivered on time at our home shortly after.  Such a great no hassle service and our delivery guy was great!\nCrystal B. Said:\nSuper Easy, Convenient and Fast\nSuper easy. Convenient and fast.

If you are in need of a quick, super easy and convenient delivery company GoShare is your company.  I'm from Atlanta, GA I did try reaching out to other companies before this with no response.  GoShare allowed me to do everything straight from the app, including track my package.  Thank You GoShare.\nDimitar B. Said:\nPrompt, Professional, Friendly\nGoShare was recommended in store by Bob's Discount Furniture. Signing up through the Apple iPhone App Store was easy. The process is intuitive and as simple as possible. I requested a service before we left the store - 10 minutes from start to finish. We were linked to a transport company within 10 minutes before we managed to leave the plaza. The service we received was prompt, professional, friendly, accurate and with great care. Will recommend to any friend who needs fast, reliable transport avoiding the overpriced premiums of others. Will definitely use again.\nFrancesca P. Said:\nGoShare is incredible\nGoShare is incredible.  I have used them three times now and every time they are getting me out of a bind in such an efficient and cost effective way!  This third time I used bigger truck - with one day's notice! - that was clean and big and the driver and helper were fantastic.  And it was a long distance delivery!  I am so tired of the pricing and rigidity of the traditional moving industry.  I am so grateful for GoShare.\nBrittany L. Said:\nHelpful and Professional\nGreat service! Downloaded the app and my furniture was picked up and delivered in about an hour! Musa, our driver, was helpful and professional. It's kinda like the Uber for furniture (or other heavy duty items) delivery! Highly recommend.\nAndy S. Said:\nOn Demand Courier and Freight Services\nI had been looking for a service that could provide on demand courier and freight services for my business. I came across GoShare through a Google search and could not be happier with the service thus far. I've done about a dozen orders in the past few weeks and each time the driver has been on time or early, friendly, and very helpful.\nWill J. Said:\nGreat App\nGoShare is the Uber of when you need a \"truck or a van and a guy\". Great App. Fast Response. and reasonably priced. This will become more & more popular when the word gets out. I had a guy come out with a beautiful new cargo van he bought just to be a GoShare Driver.  Great attitude and excellent service.\nBeth V. Said:\nGreat Service!\nI have found pieces of furniture at Home Goods in the past but neglected to purchased due to not having the right truck to transport- yesterday I found 2 gorgeous pieces to use in our rental home at the beach & was so happy to see the advertisement right there on top of the tv cabinet I wanted- I signed up while waiting in line & just had both pieces delivery by Henry! Very professional & punctual! Love this service & will ask for Henry in the future!\nCurran D. Said:\nAmazing Service, Fair Prices\nLoved my first experience with this company and app. The driver was able to pick up the furniture on his own without me having to meet at the store I bought the furniture from, which was convenient with my busy schedule. The driver took very good care of the furniture, using blankets and tie downs. The driver also helped move it into my house, and wow was it heavy. The driver went above and beyond, I couldn't be more pleased with this app. Thanks for running a great service.\nM. Panday Said:\nProfessional and Punctual\nHad a wonderful experience using GoShare to get a power recliner sofa with 6 big boxes delivered from local Costco store to my apartment. The individuals were very professional and punctual. The Goshare platform was simple and straight forward and I got response within minutes of submitting move request. I would recommend anyone looking to do moves or pickup to use their services. In fact while at Costco many people enquires about how and what I am using to move. The plus was that the platform allows you to add a helper to your request.
