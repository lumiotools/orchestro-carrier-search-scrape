Enter Ship-from-Store (SFS), a fulfillment model that leverages the power of your brick-and-mortar stores to fulfill online orders, unlocking a treasure trove of benefits for both retailers and customers.\nWhat is Ship-from-Store?\nSimply put, SFS allows you to ship online orders directly from your physical stores instead of solely relying on centralized warehouses. This means customers living closer to your stores can receive their purchases quicker and in some cases, on the same day. Additionally, products that might be out of stock online due to warehouse limitations can still be available if they're present in nearby stores, leading to fewer missed sales opportunities.\nWhy Should Indian Retailers Consider SFS?\nThe Indian retail sector is witnessing a digital boom, with e-commerce sales expected to reach a staggering $350 billion by 2030. To cater to this burgeoning online demand, retailers need efficient fulfillment solutions that prioritize speed, convenience, and affordability. SFS offers a compelling value proposition in this regard:\nFaster Deliveries: By leveraging geographically closer stores, SFS enables significantly faster deliveries, especially in metro cities and densely populated areas. This can be a game-changer for customers who increasingly expect swift product delivery. A study by PwC revealed that nearly 70% of Indian online shoppers consider fast delivery a crucial factor in their purchase decisions.\nWider Product Availability: With SFS, your online product catalog expands beyond your warehouses, encompassing the combined inventory of all your stores. This means customers can access a wider variety of products, even those with limited stock in warehouses, leading to increased sales and customer satisfaction.\nCost Savings: SFS can reduce shipping costs, especially for smaller orders fulfilled from nearby stores. Additionally, it minimizes the need for costly inventory transfers between warehouses and stores, further optimizing your logistics spend.\nThe Rise of SFS in India: Statistics and Trends\nThe adoption of SFS is gaining momentum in the Indian retail space, driven by increasing consumer demand for faster deliveries and the growing presence of omnichannel retail strategies. Here are some key statistics that highlight this trend:\nA 2023 report by Retailers Association of India (RAI) states that over 40% of Indian retailers are planning to implement SFS by 2025.\nA RedSeer Consulting study predicts that SFS will contribute to 20% of all e-commerce orders in India by 2025.\nLeading Indian retailers like Myntra, Flipkart, and Big Bazaar have successfully implemented SFS, experiencing significant improvements in delivery times and customer satisfaction.\nThese numbers paint a clear picture: SFS is not just a fad, but a strategic imperative for Indian retailers to thrive in the competitive e-commerce landscape.\nImplementing SFS Effectively: Unleashing the Full Potential\nBuilding upon the exciting introduction to Ship-from-Store (SFS), let's dive deeper into the practicalities of implementing this transformative strategy. As with any new endeavor, careful planning and execution are crucial to ensure a smooth transition and reap the maximum benefits. This section will guide you through the key steps involved in successfully bringing SFS to life in your Indian retail operation.\nAssessing Your Readiness: Before You Take the Plunge\nBefore embarking on your SFS journey, it's vital to conduct a thorough evaluation of your existing infrastructure and capabilities. Here are some key aspects to consider:\nProduct Types: Analyze your product portfolio to identify items suitable for SFS. Fragile items or those requiring special handling might be better suited for warehouse fulfillment. Conversely, smaller, readily available items are ideal SFS candidates.\nStore Distribution: Assess your store network's geographical spread and customer density. Stores located in high-demand areas are prime candidates for SFS implementation.\nOrder Management System (OMS): Ensure your OMS can seamlessly integrate with your store inventory management system (IMS) to provide real-time inventory visibility and facilitate efficient order fulfillment across channels.\nTechnology Infrastructure: Evaluate your technology infrastructure's ability to handle increased order volume and ensure smooth communication between stores, warehouses, and the OMS. Upgrading systems and investing in robust data security measures might be necessary.\nWarehouse Operations: Streamline your warehouse processes to ensure timely replenishment of store inventory for SFS orders. Consider implementing a central warehouse model or strategically positioning smaller fulfillment centers closer to your stores.\nStaff Training: Train your store staff on efficient picking, packing, and shipping procedures specifically for SFS orders. Equip them with the necessary tools and technology to fulfill orders accurately and quickly.\nBy conducting a thorough readiness assessment, you can identify potential challenges and address them proactively, setting yourself up for a successful SFS implementation.\nIntegration and Technology: Your Digital Backbone\nSFS hinges on seamless integration between various systems and technologies. Here are some crucial elements:\nOrder Management System (OMS): The OMS acts as the central nervous system, receiving online orders, routing them to the appropriate fulfillment location (store or warehouse), and tracking their progress throughout the process. Choose an OMS with robust SFS capabilities, allowing for efficient order allocation, inventory management, and communication with stores.\nInventory Management System (IMS): Ensure your IMS provides real-time, accurate inventory data across all stores and warehouses. This transparency is crucial for effective SFS order allocation and prevents overselling unavailable items.\nWarehouse Management System (WMS) (Optional): If you have a central warehouse or multiple fulfillment centers, a WMS can optimize inventory management, picking, and packing processes within these facilities.\nMobile Apps and Devices: Equip your store staff with mobile apps or devices to access order details, scan inventory, and process shipments efficiently. This streamlines store-based fulfillment and minimizes errors.\nAPIs and Data Exchange: Ensure seamless data exchange between your OMS, IMS, WMS, and other relevant systems through APIs. This real-time data flow is essential for accurate inventory visibility and smooth order fulfillment.\nInvesting in the right technology is an essential step towards creating a robust and efficient SFS operation.\nInventory Allocation and Replenishment: Striking the Right Balance\nEffective SFS relies on a well-defined strategy for allocating inventory across stores and ensuring timely replenishment. Here are some key considerations:\nDemand Forecasting: Implement accurate demand forecasting techniques to anticipate product demand in different store locations. This helps allocate inventory strategically and minimize stockouts.\nABC Analysis: Classify your inventory based on value and demand (e.g., A for high-value, high-demand, B for moderate, and C for low). Allocate high-demand items (A) to stores with higher sales, while less-demanded items (C) can be stocked centrally or replenished less frequently.\nSafety Stock Levels: Maintain optimal safety stock levels at stores to buffer against unexpected demand surges and prevent stockouts. Regularly review and adjust these levels based on sales data and historical trends.\nReplenishment Strategies: Develop efficient replenishment strategies to keep store inventory levels optimal. Consider options like continuous replenishment programs (CRP) from warehouses or direct shipments from suppliers to stores for specific items.\nCentralized Management: Establish a centralized team to manage inventory allocation and replenishment across all stores, ensuring consistency and efficiency.\nBy implementing a data-driven approach to inventory allocation and replenishment, you can ensure optimal stock levels in your stores, leading to faster fulfillment and higher customer satisfaction.\nPicking and Packing: Optimizing for Speed and Accuracy\nStore-based order fulfillment requires efficient picking and packing processes to meet customer expectations for fast delivery. Here are some strategies to optimize these operations:\nPicking Optimization: Implement zone picking or batch picking strategies to minimize travel time within the store and optimize picker productivity. Utilize barcode scanners and mobile devices for accurate order picking and real-time inventory updates.\nPacking Efficiency: Train staff on proper packing techniques to ensure items are secure and protected during transit. Standardize packaging sizes and materials based on product types and shipping distances. Consider using eco-friendly packaging options to align with sustainability practices.\nQuality Control: Implement a quality control process to ensure orders are picked, packed, and shipped accurately. This can involve visual inspections, weight checks, and verification of item descriptions.\nTechnology Integration: Integrate picking and packing processes with your OMS and IMS for real-time order tracking, inventory updates, and label generation. This streamlines operations and minimizes errors.\nBy optimizing picking and packing processes, you can ensure faster order fulfillment, reduce errors, and enhance customer satisfaction.\nShipping and Delivery: Tailoring Options for the Indian Market\nOffering a variety of shipping and delivery options tailored to the Indian market is crucial for SFS success. Here are some key considerations:\nLocal Courier Services: Partner with reliable local courier services to ensure efficient and cost-effective delivery within cities and nearby areas. Consider offering express delivery options for faster turnaround times.\nNational Carriers: For intercity deliveries, partner with established national carriers like India Post, DTDC, or Blue Dart to ensure wider reach and reliable service.\nIn-Store Pickup: Offer in-store pickup as an option for customers who prefer to collect their orders themselves. This can be particularly appealing for larger items or for customers who value immediate gratification.\nClick-and-Collect: Enable click-and-collect, where customers order online and pick up their purchases at a nearby store. This combines the convenience of online shopping with the immediacy of in-store pickup.\nCash on Delivery (COD): Consider offering COD as a payment option, especially in areas with limited online payment penetration. This can increase order conversions and cater to customers who prefer cash transactions.\nDelivery Timeframes: Be transparent about delivery timeframes based on customer location and chosen shipping method. Offer real-time tracking options to keep customers informed about their orders.\nBy providing a variety of shipping and delivery options that cater to diverse customer needs and preferences, you can enhance the overall SFS experience and drive customer satisfaction.\nOptimizing Your SFS Strategy for Maximum Impact\nHaving established the core principles of implementing SFS, let's now explore how to optimize your strategy and maximize its impact on your Indian retail operations.\nReal-time Inventory Visibility: The Cornerstone of Success\nReal-time visibility into your inventory across all stores and warehouses is the cornerstone of successful SFS. This transparency allows you to:\nAccurately allocate orders to the store with the closest available stock.\nPrevent overselling by dynamically updating inventory levels as orders are processed.\nOptimize replenishment strategies by identifying stores needing stock and prioritizing shipments.\nImprove customer satisfaction by providing accurate delivery estimates based on real-time stock availability.\nInvest in technology solutions that provide real-time inventory updates, such as:\nRFID tags on products for automatic tracking.\nIntegration between your OMS, IMS, and store systems for seamless data flow.\nMobile apps for store staff to access and update inventory levels in real-time.\nBy ensuring real-time inventory visibility, you empower informed decision-making, streamline operations, and ultimately enhance customer satisfaction.\nDemand Forecasting: Anticipate, Don't React\nAccurately forecasting demand is crucial for optimizing your SFS strategy. This allows you to:\nPre-position inventory in high-demand stores to avoid stockouts.\nPlan replenishment schedules efficiently, minimizing unnecessary stock transfers and storage costs.\nAllocate staff resources effectively in stores based on anticipated order volume.\nImplement data-driven demand forecasting techniques, considering factors like:\nHistorical sales data from individual stores and regions.\nSeasonal trends and upcoming promotions.\nLocal events and holidays that might impact demand.\nNational and regional economic indicators.\nBy proactively anticipating demand fluctuations, you can ensure smooth SFS operations, minimize stockouts, and optimize resource allocation.\nPromotions and Markdown Management: Leveraging SFS for Increased Sales\nSFS can be a powerful tool for managing promotions and markdowns effectively. Here's how:\nTargeted promotions: Run targeted promotions based on specific store inventory, offering discounts on products available in nearby stores for faster delivery.\nMarkdown optimization: Identify slow-moving items in individual stores and offer targeted markdowns to clear inventory and free up space for faster-selling products.\nPromotional bundling: Bundle products available in the same store for faster delivery and create attractive offers to drive sales.\nBy leveraging SFS for promotions and markdowns, you can increase sales, optimize inventory management, and enhance customer satisfaction with faster delivery options.\nCustomer Experience: Seamless Omnichannel Integration\nA seamless omnichannel experience is key to maximizing the benefits of SFS. Here are some key considerations:\nIntegrated online and offline experience: Ensure consistent product information, pricing, and availability across your website, mobile app, and physical stores.\nClick-and-collect and in-store pickup options: Offer convenient click-and-collect and in-store pickup options to cater to customers who prefer immediacy or want to avoid delivery charges.\nReal-time order tracking: Provide customers with real-time order tracking capabilities, allowing them to easily monitor the progress of their SFS orders.\nReturns and exchanges: Streamline returns and exchanges by allowing customers to return or exchange SFS orders at any of your stores, regardless of the purchase location.\nBy integrating SFS seamlessly with your overall customer experience strategy, you can build customer loyalty and trust, leading to repeat business and increased sales.\nMeasuring Success: Tracking Key Metrics and KPIs\nMeasuring the success of your SFS strategy is crucial for continuous improvement. Here are some key metrics to track:\nOrder fulfillment time: Track the average time it takes to fulfill SFS orders from the moment they are placed to the moment they are shipped or picked up.\nInventory turnover rate: Monitor inventory turnover rate across your stores to ensure optimal stock levels and avoid overstocking or stockouts.\nDelivery costs: Measure SFS delivery costs per order and compare them to traditional warehouse fulfillment costs to assess cost savings.\nCustomer satisfaction: Track customer satisfaction with SFS delivery times, product availability, and overall experience to identify areas for improvement.\nSales conversion rate: Monitor the conversion rate for orders fulfilled through SFS compared to warehouse fulfillment to assess the impact on sales.\nBy regularly tracking these key metrics and analyzing the data, you can identify areas for improvement, refine your SFS strategy, and maximize its impact on your business goals.\nEnhancing customer satisfaction and driving sustainable growth.\nBy carefully planning, implementing, and optimizing your SFS strategy, you can reap these significant benefits:\nIncreased customer satisfaction: Faster deliveries, wider product availability, and convenient pickup options lead to happier customers who are more likely to return and recommend your brand.\nImproved omnichannel experience: SFS bridges the gap between online and offline channels, creating a seamless shopping experience for customers regardless of their preferred purchase method.\nCompetitive edge: By offering faster deliveries and wider product choices, you can differentiate yourself from competitors and attract new customers.\nReduced costs: SFS can lead to cost savings on shipping, warehousing, and inventory management.\nBoost sales and revenue: Faster deliveries, wider product availability, and improved customer satisfaction ultimately translate to increased sales and revenue growth.\nThe Indian retail landscape is at an exciting crossroads, and SFS presents a unique opportunity to embrace the future and thrive in the ever-evolving market. By taking the initiative and implementing a well-defined SFS strategy, you can unlock the full potential of your physical stores, enhance your online presence, and deliver an exceptional customer experience.\n  Stay on top \u2013 Get the daily news from Indian Retailer in your inbox\nRetail & Business\nTop Gift Ideas for Retail Employee Day 2024: Show Your Appreciation\nBY - Ria Duneja\nMT Editorial\nNov 22, 2024 / 20 MIN READ\nFollow Us\n  Your employees are the spine of your success, working tirelessly to perform extraordinary duties to have things in order.

It has a market value of over $19.30 billion in 2023 globally and is continually expanding due to higher exports, growing health consciousness, and a need for genuine flavours. \nAlso Read: Top 7 Green Tea Brands in India\u2014Sip Your Way to Health\nTop 8 Geyser Brands in India for a Warm Winter\nBenefits of Spices  \nSpices are more than just flavor enhancers.

Here\u2019s a breakdown of the key differences:\n1. Form and Texture\nSpices: These are typically ground or powdered forms of various plant parts like seeds, roots, or bark. Ground spices are convenient but can lose flavor over time due to oxidation. Examples include ground turmeric, ground cumin, and chili powder.\nWhole Spices: Whole spices are the unprocessed forms of the spice that are intact in their natural state. They include whole cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks, bay leaves, and mustard seeds. These spices retain their oils and flavors much longer.\n2. Flavor Intensity\nSpices: Ground spices have a more intense flavor, but they can also lose potency quickly once exposed to air. To retain their strength, they must be used within a short period after grinding.\nWhole Spices: Whole spices tend to have a milder flavor initially but release their full potential when crushed or ground just before use.\n3. Shelf Life\nSpices: Ground spices have a shorter shelf life compared to whole spices. Their flavor diminishes after 6 months to a year, especially if not stored properly.\nWhole Spices: Whole spices last much longer, typically up to 2-3 years if stored in airtight containers in a cool, dry place. The whole form helps preserve the volatile oils that contribute to the spice's flavor.\n4. Usage in Cooking\nSpices: Ground spices are often used in curries, gravies, or sprinkled over dishes as they dissolve quickly and blend well into the food.\nWhole Spices: Whole spices are usually added to dishes early in the cooking process (such as when tempering oil) to infuse their flavor into the oil or broth. \nKnow more: 10 Best Indian Coffee Brands for Coffee Lovers\n10 Best Coffee Brands in India That Will Boost Your Mornings\nLesser-Known Facts About Spices\nTurmeric has been used in Ayurveda for over 4,000 years.\nIndia produces 70% of the world\u2019s spices.\nKashmiri chili is known for its vibrant red color, not its heat.\nList of the Top 8 Spices Brands in India\nDiscover your taste with these brands and make your every meal unforgettable. \n1.

The blending of online and offline retail is no longer a nice to have. We\u2019ve moved past the point of omnichannel fulfillment being optional. It is now the only way forward. All of the world\u2019s retail bigwigs have recognized that seamless integration between online and digital channels is the future.\nBreaking Boundaries\nThe urgency around adopting omnichannel fulfillment is becoming increasingly clear: the lines between online and offline shopping are not just blurred\u2014they've disappeared entirely. The crux of the matter is, that today\u2019s shoppers don\u2019t care where they buy from as long as they get a unified, fast, and curated experience.\nThe pandemic didn\u2019t just speed up the digital revolution; it changed how customers interact with brands\u2014forever. This shift in consumer behavior has placed enormous pressure on retailers to rethink their operations. The challenge of implementing omnichannel is manifold, on top of syncing inventory across channels in real-time, brands must also provide experiential shopping experiences, and keep everything running smoothly all the time. Are the stakes higher than ever? You bet they are, but there\u2019s no other option. It\u2019s a go big or go home.\nWhat It Takes To Become Truly Omnichannel\nOne thing without which omnichannel is virtually impossible is the presence of a unified inventory. Yes, omnichannel fulfillment can radically transform shoppers\u2019 journeys but for that to happen brands must first adopt strategies like using their physical retail outlets as dark stores or utilizing local Kirana stores as mini-hubs or fulfillment centers. When your physical stores double as fulfillment centers, you\u2019re no longer bound by geographical limitations. A shopper in Delhi could get their product from a Mumbai brand, shaving days off delivery times.\nIn times when you can lay your hands on the brand new iPhone 16 within 10 minutes of ordering thanks to quick commerce platforms like Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto, lightning-fast deliveries are non-negotiable.\nBut there\u2019s more to omnichannel than speed. Omnichannel isn\u2019t about mastering any one thing. It\u2019s about providing a holistic brand experience for the customer at every touchpoint.\nPhygital innovative strategies like BOPIS (Buy Online, Pick-Up In-Store) and BORIS (Buy Online, Return In-Store) are pivotal to fostering customer loyalty. Why? Because you\u2019re meeting the customer on their terms. Whether customers want to pick up an item, return it in person, or have it delivered in a flash, these are the touchpoints where loyalty is built.\nThe Omnichannel Factor: Days of Future Present\nRetailers must note that the benefits of omnichannel fulfillment extend beyond customer convenience. These strategies also drive operational efficiencies, lower logistics costs, and unlock untapped inventory.\nMoreover, the omnichannel approach is especially effective in tackling one of e-commerce\u2019s biggest challenges\u2014returns. It\u2019s ultimately these post-purchase interactions between the brand and the customer that help businesses find new ways to grow and serve.\nIt has become apparent that omnichannel could potentially overhaul the way we shop today. In 2024 and beyond, omnichannel fulfillment is not a luxury, it\u2019s a survival strategy for brands wanting to stay relevant in the ever-evolving ecommerce marketplace.  The future belongs to those who can deliver consistent, personalized experiences wherever their customers choose to engage, online, offline, and everywhere in between.\n  Authored By\nPrashant Gupta, Co-founder, ClickPost\n  Retail TrendsfutureomnichannelOmni Channel Retail\nNext Story\nRetail & Business\nThanking Retail Heroes: Unique Celebration and Theme Ideas for Retail Employee Day\nBY - Ria Duneja\nMT Editorial\nNov 21, 2024 / 15 MIN READ\nFollow Us\n  International Retail Employee Day also known as \u2018RED\u2019 is celebrated on December 12 and is a fantastic opportunity to show appreciation for the efforts of the retail staff.

With a projected revenue increase of 10-12 percent, the retail sector is gearing up for a transformative phase, driven by improved occupancy rates, steady rental escalations, and resilient balance sheets. These insights from recent analyses highlight the growing significance of malls as retail anchors in both Tier-I and Tier-II cities.\nNumbers That Speak for Themselves\nMall operators are capitalizing on the momentum from last fiscal\u2019s remarkable 15 percent revenue jump. This year, growth is supported by factors such as contractual rental increases of 4-5 percent, a rise in tenant revenues, and a surge in occupancy levels. Malls launched over the past two years are beginning to see significant ramp-ups, contributing to an estimated overall occupancy rate of 92-93 percent this fiscal, up from 89 percent last year.\nFor established malls, the occupancy rate remains robust at approximately 95 percent, with timely lease renewals reinforcing stability. This consistency underscores the growing confidence of retailers in malls as prime locations to reach their target audiences.\nRetail Consumption\nWhile retail consumption growth in these malls moderated to 3-5 percent in the first half of this fiscal, a stark drop from the 12.5 percent recorded in the same period last year, this is largely attributed to a high base effect and the heat wave that impacted footfalls. Tier-I cities, in particular, bore the brunt of this slowdown. However, the narrative is set to shift in the second half, with an above-normal monsoon and the festive and wedding seasons expected to drive a resurgence in consumer activity.\nImportantly, revenue sharing with tenants, which constitutes 10-15 percent of total mall revenue, mitigates the impact of consumption dips. This revenue diversification strategy ensures that mall operators remain insulated from short-term consumption fluctuations.\nBalancing Growth with Stability\nThe financial health of mall operators remains strong, underpinned by efficient operations and prudent debt management. EBITDA margins, a key indicator of operational efficiency, have consistently held firm at around 70 percent over the past few years and are expected to remain stable this fiscal.\nDebt levels, too, are under control. Even with ongoing capital expenditure plans aimed at adding 2-3 million square feet of retail space over the next 2-3 years, cash accruals are sufficient to fund these expansions. Consequently, the debt-to-EBITDA ratio is projected to improve to 2.6-2.8 times by the end of this fiscal, compared to 2.9 times last year.\n\u201cHealthy operating performance, underpinned by rising occupancy and anticipated rental growth, will help improve the debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.6-2.8 times by the end of this fiscal from 2.9 times last fiscal,\u201d says Snehil Shukla, Associate Director, CRISIL Ratings.\nTier-I vs. Tier-II Cities\nOne of the most interesting dynamics this fiscal is the divergence between Tier-I and Tier-II cities. While Tier-I cities have experienced a sharper moderation in retail consumption, Tier-II cities have shown resilience, supported by a growing appetite for organized retail. As malls in smaller cities continue to gain traction, they represent a key growth avenue for operators looking to diversify their portfolios.\nUpcoming Challenges and Watch Points\nWhile the outlook is positive, certain challenges warrant attention. The expansion of mall portfolios through new projects and acquisitions necessitates careful financial planning. Any large debt-funded acquisitions could strain balance sheets, even as operators work to maintain their strong credit profiles.\nSays Gautam Shahi, Director, CRISIL Ratings, \u201cOverall occupancy for malls is expected to increase to 92-93 percent this fiscal from 89 percent last fiscal. This will be driven by a surge in occupancy for malls that were launched in the last two fiscals, while occupancy for established malls will remain stable at ~95 percent, with timely renewals.\u201d\nA Stable Future for Retail Spaces\nAs retail continues to adapt to evolving consumer preferences, shopping malls are set to remain a cornerstone of the industry. By focusing on maximizing occupancy and leveraging revenue-sharing models, mall operators are creating resilient business models that can withstand external shocks.\nWith credit profiles stable, operating margins strong, and a clear strategy for growth, the retail sector is poised to benefit significantly from these developments. The future of malls lies not just in their physical spaces but in their ability to blend experiences, drive consumer engagement, and adapt to the changing retail landscape. \n  biggest mallConsumer trendsretail India\nNext Story\nRetail & Business\nIndia's BPC Market Set for 8 pc CAGR Growth in Four Years\nBY - Vaishnavi Gupta\nAssistant Editor, IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\nNov 20, 2024 / 12 MIN READ\nFollow Us\n  The Indian Beauty and Personal Care (BPC) market is on an exhilarating growth trajectory, reflecting the diverse and evolving preferences of the country's vast consumer base. As the 6th largest BPC market globally, India's contributions are steadily rising, driven by favorable socio-economic factors, increased online penetration, and the adoption of global trends. Despite currently contributing only 4 percent to the global BPC market, India is one of the fastest-growing markets in the world, with an anticipated 8 percent CAGR in the next four to five years, according to BDO India. The sector's transformation underscores a dynamic interplay of premiumization, digitalization, and a growing consumer base across urban and rural geographies.\nKey Drivers of Growth\n1. Rising Disposable Incomes and Urbanisation\nIndia\u2019s burgeoning middle class, coupled with increasing disposable incomes, has significantly boosted per capita expenditure on beauty and personal care products. In 2023, the per capita spend on BPC stood at $15, with projections to reach $27 by 2030. This shift signifies an evolution in consumer priorities, as grooming and wellness gain prominence alongside traditional essentials.\n2. Youthful Demographics and Workforce Participation\nWith the largest youth population globally, India is uniquely positioned to harness its demographic dividend. The growing participation of women in the workforce has further accelerated the demand for premium and masstige products that cater to professional and personal grooming needs.\n3. Digital Transformation and E-Commerce Growth\nDigitalization has been a game-changer for the Indian BPC market. E-commerce platforms, combined with increasing smartphone penetration, have made beauty products accessible to consumers across urban and rural areas. This has not only expanded market reach but also allowed brands to implement data-driven strategies, catering to evolving consumer preferences.\nOnline platforms also serve as a powerful tool for product discovery, with beauty influencers and social media campaigns shaping purchasing decisions. This digital-first approach has revolutionized the traditional retail landscape, fostering brand engagement and loyalty.\nEmerging Trends in the Indian BPC Market\n1. Natural and Organic Products\nThe demand for natural, organic, and sustainable products has surged as consumers become increasingly conscious of ingredient safety and environmental impact. This trend aligns with global movements, yet uniquely leverages India's rich heritage of Ayurveda and traditional beauty practices.\nBy blending ancient Indian remedies with modern scientific formulations, brands are carving out a niche that resonates with both domestic and international consumers. The result is a market teeming with opportunities for brands committed to transparency, sustainability, and ethical production.\n2. Premiumisation and Masstige Expansion\nPremiumization is a dominant theme, with a growing consumer base seeking high-quality, effective products. The masstige segment, which bridges the gap between mass and prestige offerings, has witnessed remarkable growth, catering to aspirational yet value-conscious consumers.\nAdditionally, the emergence of Indian celebrity-owned beauty brands, inspired by Western counterparts like Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty and Kylie Jenner\u2019s Kylie Cosmetics, has further fueled consumer interest in premium products. Notable domestic examples include Priyanka Chopra\u2019s Anomaly, showcasing the appeal of homegrown brands with global standards.\n3. Inclusivity and Personalisation\nInclusive beauty has gained momentum, particularly in the makeup and skincare segments. Brands are increasingly catering to diverse skin tones and specific concerns, reflecting India's multicultural fabric. This shift underscores the growing demand for personalized solutions, driven by a consumer base that values individualized care.\n4. Technology and Innovation\nTechnological advancements, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality (AR), are reshaping the BPC landscape. AI-powered recommendations, virtual try-ons, and diagnostic tools have enhanced the consumer experience, bridging the gap between physical and digital retail.\nAnother emerging trend is nutricosmetics, which integrate beauty and wellness, offering supplements that promote skin health, hair growth, and overall vitality. This fusion of beauty and nutrition aligns with the holistic approach favored by modern consumers.\nMarket Dynamics: Incumbents vs. New-Age Players\nThe Indian BPC market, traditionally dominated by multinational corporations, has become a competitive battleground with the entry of new-age domestic players. While the top 20 brands hold 32 percent of the market, the landscape is evolving rapidly. Seven of these top brands are homegrown, and several startups have surpassed the INR 1,000 million revenue mark in the last decade.\nNotably, these new-age companies have demonstrated remarkable agility, achieving over 30 percent CAGR in recent years. Their success lies in leveraging omnichannel strategies, embracing digital innovation, and responding swiftly to changing consumer demands.\nChallenges and Opportunities\nWhile the Indian BPC market offers immense potential, sustainable and capital-efficient growth remains a critical challenge. With increasing competition, brands must navigate:\nEvolving Consumer Preferences: Staying relevant in a market driven by rapidly shifting trends.\nRural Penetration: Reaching underserved areas requires innovative distribution models.\nSustainability Mandates: Aligning with global standards for ethical sourcing and production.\nHowever, the market also presents abundant opportunities. The fusion of traditional Indian practices with scientific breakthroughs offers a competitive edge, while the growing demand for ethical, natural, and personalized products provides fertile ground for innovation.\nRole of Distribution Channels\nLast-mile access has become a cornerstone of growth, with tier II and III cities emerging as significant contributors. Brands are tapping into these markets through partnerships, enhanced supply chains, and targeted marketing efforts.\nThe omnichannel approach, integrating offline and online touchpoints, is increasingly adopted by both incumbents and challengers. Physical stores remain relevant for experiential retail, while online platforms cater to convenience and wide-scale reach.\nREAD MORE: How India\u2019s Beauty Industry is Thriving on D2C and Digitalization\nFuture Outlook\nSamir Sheth, Head of Deal Advisory Services at BDO India, highlights the sector's favorable conditions, stating, \u201cThe Indian beauty sector is uniquely positioned to build brands with lasting impact.

From reimagining product lines to executing impactful marketing campaigns, McVitie\u2019s is setting new benchmarks in the highly competitive indulgent snacks category. In this exclusive feature, Pawan Jagnik, Head of Marketing, McVitie\u2019s, Pladis India shared insights into the strategies that have fueled McVitie\u2019s success, the innovative campaigns that have captured consumers' hearts, and the future roadmap for the brand in India.\nRelaunching a Legacy\nOne of the brand\u2019s most successful recent initiatives has been the relaunch of its indulgent Cookies and Creams range under the global McVitie\u2019s Tasties brand. According to Jagnik, \u201cIn just three months, we revitalized the entire product line. This was instrumental in reviving our distribution network and expanding our range-selling capabilities.\u201d\nThe relaunch wasn't just a product refresh\u2014it was a strategic endeavor that combined rigorous planning, efficient execution, and seamless cross-functional coordination. \u201cThe impact was phenomenal,\u201d Jagnik recalled. \u201cIt significantly boosted the brand\u2019s visibility, reignited consumer interest, and strengthened our position within the indulgent snacks category. This initiative didn\u2019t just increase sales\u2014it reinforced the global brand\u2019s resonance in India and contributed to sustained growth.\u201d\nWinning Hearts with Creative Campaigns\nMcVitie\u2019s campaigns are a testament to its innovative approach to consumer engagement. Among its most impactful efforts was McVitie\u2019s Premier League \u2013 Game Tumhara, Take Humara campaign, executed during the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\u201cWhat set this campaign apart was its creativity,\u201d shared Jagnik. \u201cWe brought our biscuits to life as commentators, each offering a unique perspective on the matches. These animated biscuits shared fun and quirky match updates, adding a delightful twist to our content.\u201d\nThis initiative resonated strongly with cricket-loving audiences, reaching 2.9 million people and generating over 1,26,000 engagements, with an engagement rate of 4.3 percent, well above the industry benchmark of 3 percent. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just about visibility,\u201d said Jagnik. \u201cThe campaign deepened consumer engagement and reinforced brand loyalty, making it a pivotal moment in our marketing journey.\u201d\nAdaptability\nIn an ever-evolving market, McVitie\u2019s has successfully maintained a consistent brand image while adapting to changing consumer preferences. A prime example is the introduction of North Indianized flavors like Butter Jeera. \u201cButter Jeera was developed to resonate with regional tastes, particularly for tea-time consumption, which is deeply ingrained in Indian culture,\u201d explained Jagnik. \u201cWhile the North has always been a strong market for us, this product\u2019s success has led to increased demand across other regions as well. It\u2019s a perfect example of balancing core brand values with local innovation.\u201d\nThis strategy has not only reinforced McVitie\u2019s brand equity but also strengthened its distribution network, ensuring the brand remains relevant across diverse consumer segments.\nDriving Loyalty Through Authenticity and Focus\nFor McVitie\u2019s, building consumer loyalty hinges on authenticity and a clear brand stance. \u201cConsumers appreciate brands that are genuine and transparent,\u201d highlighted Jagnik. \u201cWe focus on staying true to our messaging and actions, which helps build trust.\u201d\nThe brand\u2019s commitment to its core values\u2014health, quality, and taste\u2014has created a strong emotional connection with consumers. \u201cBy focusing on what we stand for, we differentiate ourselves in a crowded market,\u201d Jagnik noted. \u201cThis clarity fosters loyalty, ensuring our consumers keep coming back for more.\u201d\nInnovating to Stay Ahead\nInnovation is at the heart of McVitie\u2019s strategy to stay ahead of the competition. One standout initiative has been tailoring its offerings for different consumer cohorts. \u201cWe\u2019ve identified specific consumer segments, such as frequent travelers, who resonate with products like Thins, Nibbles, and Coated Digestives,\u201d Jagnik explained. \u201cTo cater to their on-the-go lifestyles, we\u2019ve made these products available through quick commerce platforms.\u201d\nAt the same time, McVitie\u2019s remains deeply rooted in Indian traditions. \u201cOur Butter Jeera biscuits celebrate the timeless ritual of dunking biscuits in tea, creating moments of togetherness with family and friends,\u201d asserted Jagnik. \u201cFor health-conscious consumers, products like McVitie\u2019s Hobnobs Chocolate offer indulgence without guilt.\u201d\nConsumer Feedback: The North Star\nConsumer feedback plays a pivotal role in shaping McVitie\u2019s marketing initiatives. \u201cOur campaigns, particularly on social media, are informed by what our consumers tell us they love,\u201d shared Jagnik.\nThe McVitie\u2019s Premier League campaign is a case in point. \u201cWe tapped into India\u2019s passion for cricket to create a campaign that was both engaging and relevant,\u201d he noted. The brand has also embraced meme marketing to connect with Gen Z, building conversations around the McVitie\u2019s Tasties range.\n\u201cThis approach ensures our campaigns resonate with our audience, fostering deeper connections and driving engagement,\u201d Jagnik added.\nThe Road Ahead\nLooking forward, Jagnik sees several trends and technologies shaping McVitie\u2019s future success. \u201cCreating content that resonates with specific demographics will remain crucial,\u201d he said. \u201cMemes work wonders with Gen Z, while long-form content like podcasts appeals to niche audiences. Platforms like Snapchat offer unique opportunities to connect with older consumers.\u201d\nInfluencer marketing, especially regionally targeted efforts, is another area of focus. \u201cAs consumers travel more, they seek experiences that resonate when they return home,\u201d Jagnik observed. \u201cProducts like Thins and Nibbles cater perfectly to this trend.\u201d\nFinally, McVitie\u2019s is leveraging artificial intelligence to personalize consumer experiences. \u201cAI enables us to enhance engagement like never before, from personalized recommendations to dynamic content delivery,\u201d Jagnik concluded.\n  SnackBiscuitsFMCG industry\nNext Story\nRetail & Business\nTop 7 Boot Brands in India For Women: From Casual to Corporate \nBY - Ria Duneja\nMT Editorial\nNov 18, 2024 / 16 MIN READ\nFollow Us\n  Boots represent not only shoes but rather a type of clothing accessory that encompasses style, comfort as well as usability.

Over the past two decades, the brand has cemented its position as a preferred choice for women across the country. Founded with a deep-rooted belief in providing high-quality, trend-forward designs, Lakshita has become a household name, particularly in North India, catering to a growing clientele that seeks both traditional and modern wear.\nIn an exclusive interview, Sachin Kharbanda, Managing Director and Co-Founder of Lakshita, shared insights into the brand\u2019s journey, its remarkable recovery from the challenges of the pandemic, and the exciting plans lined up for the future. \u201cWhen COVID-19 struck, we were genuinely apprehensive,\u201d he began. \u201cThere was a lot of uncertainty; we didn\u2019t know how long it would last or how it would impact our business.\u201d Yet, despite the hurdles, Lakshita\u2019s comeback was swift and strong, with the brand experiencing significant growth in the years that followed.\nNavigating Through the Pandemic\n\u201cThe initial years during COVID were daunting,\u201d said Kharbanda. \u201cThe sudden lockdowns brought everything to a standstill, and like many other businesses, we faced significant challenges with production and supply.\u201d However, once restrictions were lifted, the brand found itself benefiting from a surge in pent-up demand. \u201cIt was remarkable,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe very next year, we saw our sales skyrocket, and it was beyond our expectations. We were able to sell all our stock, clear out merchandise, and effectively cover the losses we\u2019d incurred.\u201d\nLakshita\u2019s journey since then has been nothing short of inspiring. The subsequent years brought steady growth, with sales rebounding and even exceeding pre-pandemic levels. \u201cLast year was exceptionally good for us,\u201d Kharbanda shared. \u201cBut the first half of this year was slower than expected. However, the festive season in October has brought a positive shift. Business has picked up, and it looks like we\u2019re in for a fantastic quarter.\u201d\nExpanding Footprints\nLakshita\u2019s commitment to expanding its physical presence has been a pivotal part of its strategy. \u201cWe currently have 76 stores across India,\u201d Kharbanda revealed. \u201cBy the end of this quarter, we aim to cross 85, and our target for this financial year is to reach over 100 stores.\u201d This milestone, coinciding with Lakshita\u2019s anniversary in May, is a significant achievement for the brand. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to celebrating our 100-store milestone \u2013 it\u2019s a huge accomplishment for us.\u201d\nThe brand\u2019s focus has predominantly been on North India, with a strong presence in regions like Delhi-NCR, Punjab, Jammu, and Srinagar. \u201cNorth India has been our primary market, and we are well-established here. We\u2019re also in cities like Pune, but most of our stores are located in the North.\u201d\nLooking ahead, Kharbanda noted that geographical expansion is on the horizon. \u201cOnce we cross 100 stores, we\u2019ll start expanding into the East and West of India, and eventually, we\u2019ll move towards the South.\u201d\nTier II & III Cities: A Key Growth Segment\nLakshita\u2019s expansion into smaller cities has not only increased its reach but also positively impacted its profitability. \u201cThere is a difference between revenue and profitability,\u201d Kharbanda explained. \u201cOur sales volumes are higher in bigger cities due to larger populations and higher spending power. However, operational costs are also higher in these areas, so the profit margins are thinner.\u201d\nIn contrast, Tier II and III cities offer a better profit margin, as the costs are lower. \u201cThe operational expenses are less, which makes these smaller cities more profitable for us.\u201d\nThe E-commerce Push\nWhile Lakshita has primarily built its success through its physical stores, online sales are an essential part of the brand\u2019s strategy. \u201cOur online sales currently account for around 10 percent of our total revenue, but we expect this to grow significantly by next year,\u201d Kharbanda stated.\nIts products, with a price range often above Rs 2,500, do not necessarily cater to a price-sensitive online consumer. \u201cThe online space is highly price-driven, and higher-priced items often face resistance,\u201d he explained. \u201cTo address this, we\u2019re planning to launch a dedicated product line in SS25 that caters specifically to online shoppers with more competitive price points.\u201d\nLakshita also maintains a presence on prominent marketplaces such as Myntra and Ajio, though Kharbanda pointed out the importance of offering value. \u201cConsumers are highly price-sensitive, especially in online spaces. They focus more on cost than design. So, our strategy has been to align our offerings on these platforms with what appeals most to consumers.\u201d\nDiverse Product Portfolio\nFrom an initial offering of around 50-60 SKUs, Lakshita now boasts a range of 220-250 SKUs, covering various categories like day wear and evening wear. \u201cThe competition has increased tremendously, which has encouraged us to offer a wide array of choices,\u201d Kharbanda asserted. The brand\u2019s seasonal collections keep customers coming back, particularly during festive times. \u201cFor instance, we just launched our \u2018Sitare\u2019 collection for the Karva Chauth season, and the response has been fantastic.\u201d\nThe brand\u2019s portfolio is set to expand further with the introduction of wedding collections and an \u201cIndianized\u201d Western wear line. \u201cWe\u2019ll be launching a \u2018wed\u2019 collection and a line of Indianized Western wear in SS25,\u201d Kharbanda shared. \u201cThis Western line will be different, tailored to the tastes of Indian women who prefer subtle, conservative cuts and styles.\u201d\nInvesting in Technology and Social Commerce\nLakshita\u2019s commitment to modernization extends to technology. \u201cWe have invested heavily in a new software system called Navision,\u201d Kharbanda revealed. \u201cIt enables us to manage everything from raw materials to the end consumer, mapping every step of our supply chain. This technology investment has been instrumental in enabling our omnichannel approach and enhancing our supply chain efficiency.\u201d\nSocial media, too, has played a crucial role in the company\u2019s branding and consumer outreach. \u201cSocial media has been a game-changer for us,\u201d Kharbanda highlighted. \u201cAround 70-80 percent of our marketing spend is dedicated to social platforms, and it\u2019s not just about driving online sales. Many of our customers see our new launches on social media and visit our stores to purchase. Social media has been a valuable tool in enhancing both our online and offline presence.\u201d\nFuture Plans and International Expansion\nLakshita has ambitious goals for the future, including international expansion. \u201cBy 2025, we aim to open at least two exclusive stores overseas,\u201d Kharbanda revealed. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at markets with a significant Indian diaspora, such as the UK, Singapore, the Middle East, and the US.\u201d\nIn the Indian market, the brand plans to strengthen its presence further by expanding beyond 100 stores and launching new collections. \u201cWe are continuously working to enhance the consumer experience, focusing on customer satisfaction,\u201d Kharbanda added. \u201cOur goal is to provide services like lifetime alterations, which add tremendous value to the consumer experience.\u201d\nProjected Sales and Growth Outlook\nLakshita has seen impressive growth post-pandemic, with a 60 percent increase in sales last year. \u201cThis year, despite a slower first half, we\u2019re on track to achieve a 25 percent increase over last year\u2019s sales,\u201d Kharbanda shared. \u201cAs the festive season unfolds, we\u2019re optimistic about achieving our targets.\u201d\n  Indian ethnic brandEthnic WearExpansion Plans\nNext Story\nRetail & Business\nTop 7 Lingerie Brands in India with Price: Luxe to Everyday\nBY - Ria Duneja\nMT Editorial\nNov 14, 2024 / 15 MIN READ\nFollow Us\n  Finding the right lingerie can be a game-changer, boosting confidence and enhancing comfort.

From major urban hubs to smaller towns and cities, consumers flocked to e-commerce platforms for deals, driving growth across multiple product categories and redefining the market's dynamics. The surge in demand was largely powered by the fashion segment and increased spending from Tier II + cities, highlighting the diversity of consumer behavior across the country.\nAccording to Redseer Strategy Consultants\u2019 latest report, covering the festive e-commerce period from September 15 to October 31, the sector recorded a gross merchandise value (GMV) of approximately $14 billion. This figure marks a 12 percent year-over-year growth, driven by resilient spending across categories such as quick commerce, electronics, fashion, beauty and personal care (BPC), home furnishings, and groceries. The report emphasizes the role of smaller cities and a noticeable increase in per-shopper spending, painting a vivid picture of India's evolving e-commerce market.\nA Deep Dive into the Numbers\nThe festive season of 2024 has highlighted a clear transformation in India\u2019s e-commerce market. While the overall shopper growth rate decelerated, the average spend per shopper increased by 5-6 percent. This indicates that while the e-commerce customer base has largely stabilized at around 250 million annual shoppers, their engagement and spending capacity have grown significantly.\nOne standout data point from the season is the rise of the fashion segment, which saw a threefold (3X) growth compared to the usual business-as-usual (BAU) months. Fashion, driven by ethnic wear and accessories, was particularly popular in Tier II + markets. Smaller towns and cities displayed the highest growth rates, with spending climbing 13 percent year-over-year, marking a major shift in the shopping power and preferences of these regions.\nFashion Segment Leads the Way\nThe fashion segment\u2019s phenomenal 3X growth was fueled primarily by ethnic wear and accessories. Unbranded ethnic wear, jewelry, and women\u2019s accessories emerged as hot favorites among Tier II+ customers. The increasing visibility of direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands on digital channels also contributed to the category\u2019s boom, offering customers a blend of affordability and style. Meanwhile, in metro and Tier I markets, premium and international fashion brands captured consumers' attention with strong sales figures.\nThis shift underscores the dynamic and inclusive nature of India's e-commerce landscape, where different markets reflect unique consumer preferences. Ethnic fashion dominated in smaller cities, while urban markets showed a preference for premium brands, demonstrating a healthy balance between affordability and premiumization.\nTier II + Cities: The Real Game Changers\nTier II + cities have been a driving force behind the growth of India\u2019s e-commerce market, contributing significantly to the 12 percent overall growth. Consumer spending in these markets reached a peak during the festive season. Notably, the availability of discounts allowed these customers to purchase high-value items such as premium electronics and large appliances. This segment also exhibited a marked increase in prepaid transactions, enhancing the shopping experience and increasing trust in online retail platforms.\nAs smaller towns and cities continue to embrace online shopping, it is evident that they are transforming from being value-driven consumers to sophisticated shoppers interested in both affordability and quality.\nPremium Electronics Thrive Amid Prolonged Summer\nThe extended summer season contributed to heightened demand for premium electronics, including air conditioners and large appliances. This demand was most evident in metro areas, where high-ASP (average selling price) products found eager buyers. Quick commerce platforms responded to this increased demand by expanding their offerings to include electronics and home appliances, leveraging expanded delivery hours to capitalize on the festive rush.\nNon-grocery sales also spiked on key festive days in major cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore. This highlights how consumer demand for premium goods continues to thrive, even as quick commerce redefines convenience and accessibility across India.\nWhile shopper growth has slowed, e-commerce platforms observed a notable increase in per-shopper spending. This trend, indicative of a maturing e-commerce landscape, shows that while new customer acquisition rates are stabilizing, the depth of customer engagement is expanding. The average Indian online shopper is not just browsing but buying more frequently and spending on higher-value items, contributing to long-term market growth.\nBridging the Urban-Rural Divide in E-Commerce\nThe festive season highlighted another key trend: the growing importance of bridging the gap between metro and smaller cities. The data indicates that Tier II + markets are growing faster than metro and Tier I markets, signaling a democratization of e-commerce access and spending power. Discounts and affordability are no longer the sole drivers in these regions; customers are now open to premium offerings, further diversifying the market.\nMeeting Demand at Speed\nQuick commerce is gaining traction beyond just the top three cities. The sector extended its offerings to cater to the festive demand for electronics and home appliances, providing customers with an unparalleled level of convenience. The ability to deliver products within minutes has revolutionized how metro customers shop and is poised to bring similar transformation across Tier II + cities.\nKushal Bhatnagar, Associate Partner, Redseer Strategy Consultants, highlighted this shift, saying, \"The 2024 festive season reassures us of Bharat\u2019s (Tier II + customers\u2019) spending potential. With these customers further cementing their trust in e-commerce and bringing a larger share of wallet online, we are ready to witness a continued spell of e-commerce growth in the next few years.\u201d\nLooking Ahead\nThe 2024 festive season reflects the evolving digital influence and shifting consumer preferences within India\u2019s e-commerce sector. As premiumization, quick commerce, and robust demand from Tier II + cities redefine the market, e-commerce platforms must continue adapting to maintain their competitive edge. With a 12 percent growth during the festive season and consumer behavior constantly evolving, the future of India\u2019s e-commerce market appears promising and dynamic. The insights will undoubtedly play a crucial role in helping businesses navigate this vibrant market landscape.\nBy meeting evolving consumer demands and maintaining a balance between premium offerings and affordability, India\u2019s e-commerce platforms are set to remain at the forefront of innovation, accessibility, and customer-centricity in the years to come.\n  ecommercefestivefestive salesretail Indiaindia retail\nNext Story\nRetail & Business\nTop 6 Baby Care Brands in India: Safe, Gentle, and Trusted\nBY - Saptopriya Ghosal\nJunior Writer\nNov 14, 2024 / 18 MIN READ\nFollow Us\n  It is often a real struggle to choose the proper baby care brand, such as clothes or bedding, that will ensure the baby\u2019s safety and comfort.

In an industry that has undergone a seismic transformation, thanks largely to e-commerce, these awards stand as a tribute to the trailblazers, innovators, and relentless risk-takers who are reshaping brand licensing across India and beyond. But this isn\u2019t just any awards night\u2014it\u2019s a transformative celebration of an industry on the brink of a major breakthrough.\nBehind the Scenes: The Forces Driving Licensing Growth\nThe numbers tell a story of exponential growth and sky-high potential: the global brand licensing market is expected to hit a staggering $371,993.50 million by 2028, with a healthy CAGR of 4.34% from 2023-2028. And it doesn\u2019t end there\u2014the market is forecasted to touch a jaw-dropping valuation of $433,893.22 million by 2030. But what\u2019s behind this meteoric rise?\nIt\u2019s simple. Rising disposable incomes, especially among India\u2019s expanding middle class, have fueled the demand for branded products. Consumers are no longer satisfied with the generic; they crave authenticity, exclusivity, and quality\u2014something only brand licensing can deliver. Meanwhile, the explosion of digital platforms has catapulted brand awareness, especially among the youth, who can\u2019t resist a branded experience, be it through toys, apparel, or even home d\u00e9cor.\nClick here to nominate\nMeet the Industry Disruptors\nThe Labels Awards 2024 are set to shine a spotlight on these top disruptors who are turning brand licensing into a multi-billion-dollar powerhouse. Leading names across apparel, toys, software, food & beverage, and more are pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible. Did you know the software/video game licensing segment alone is expected to grow at a blistering rate of 8.5% from 2020 to 2027, projected to reach $125.7 billion by 2027? It's all thanks to surging online gaming trends and increasing internet penetration.\nAnd it doesn\u2019t stop there. Children\u2019s merchandise remains a driving force, with new characters and themes sparking demand like wildfire. Social media, of course, amplifies the craze, with platforms like YouTube and Instagram becoming brand licensing goldmines through campaigns, contests, and more.\nThe Trailblazing Jury and Unmatched Categories\nThis year\u2019s Labels Awards jury brings together some of the sharpest minds in the business: Mukesh Ghuraiya, Chief Marketing Officer of Modi Naturals Ltd; Ritu Marya, Editor-In-Chief of Retailer & Entrepreneur Media; and Ajeet Bawa, Head of Marketing at Spencer\u2019s Retail.

Those days are long gone. Licensing now operates as its own colossal entity with its own rules, regulations, and yes, its own set of challenges\u2014counterfeiting and black markets being among the most formidable. But here\u2019s the twist: instead of holding the market back, these challenges have spurred an unprecedented surge of creativity and strategy among brands.\nE-commerce has supercharged the game by enabling brands to extend their reach in ways previously unimaginable. In just a few clicks, customers can browse and purchase licensed merchandise, breaking geographical barriers and turning casual browsers into brand loyalists. With online stores making licensed products as accessible as your morning coffee, the market is now teeming with opportunities.\nThe Other Side of the Coin\nDespite all the glitz and growth, brand licensing isn\u2019t without its share of challenges. From high costs and ever-shifting consumer preferences to the sheer complexity of legal paperwork, it\u2019s not a walk in the park. Licensing agreements come with their own set of negotiations over royalties, copyrights, and trademarks. Staying ahead demands constant innovation and a keen eye for what\u2019s next in consumer demand. Yet, for those who get it right, the rewards are limitless.\nThe Future Is Bright\nIn a world of evolving tastes and rapid innovation, brand licensing has become more than just a strategy\u2014it\u2019s a lifeline for brand growth. Labels Awards 2024 promises to celebrate those who are steering this transformation, offering a stage to those who dare to dream, innovate, and shape the industry\u2019s future.\nAre you ready to witness it?

In a comprehensive study conducted by PayNearby and the Grameen Foundation for Social Impact, data has uncovered a powerful trend: female customers are choosing women BCs more often and for higher-value transactions than their male counterparts. This shift is not just a testament to the trust and rapport women BCs build with customers but also a reflection of how female BCs can drive inclusive growth and financial empowerment in the retail space.\nA New Force in Retail\nAccording to a joint report released by PayNearby and Grameen Foundation for Social Impact, female BCs excel in engaging female customers, with their transaction values 66 percent higher than those handled by male agents. Women BCs also earn 24.4 percent more than their male counterparts while engaging with female customers, suggesting that female customers feel more comfortable conducting higher-value transactions with agents of the same gender, likely due to increased trust.\nThis trend can be seen as an important indicator of the untapped potential within rural retail banking, as women BCs are becoming a preferred choice for customers in remote communities. This preference highlights the importance of gender alignment in building customer trust, especially in regions where social dynamics play a crucial role in financial decision-making.\nFurther, the findings showcase that female BCs are not just preferred by customers but are also financially rewarded, earning 24.4 percent more from their transactions with female customers than their male counterparts. For retail banking in rural settings, these figures point to an invaluable resource that can accelerate financial inclusion efforts when fully supported and empowered.\nFlexibility at the Forefront\nWhen it comes to motivation, female BCs prioritize flexibility in work hours more than male BCs. According to the report, 45 percent of women in this field value flexible hours compared to 38 percent of men. This reflects the dual roles many rural women hold, balancing both professional responsibilities and household duties. Flexibility becomes a critical factor, enabling them to navigate cultural expectations and logistical challenges while actively contributing to their household income.\nThis need for flexibility resonates with the broader retail sector, which has seen significant success in adopting flexible work models. Understanding and accommodating this preference could be instrumental in attracting and retaining more female BCs, especially as they often face the additional burden of managing personal and family obligations.\nThe Challenge of Balancing Responsibilities\nDespite their impressive contributions, a majority of female BCs report significant challenges in balancing personal and professional lives, with 60 percent citing this as a persistent issue. The retail landscape, with its inherent demands for customer service and reliability, adds an additional layer of complexity. In regions where social and cultural constraints still impact women\u2019s ability to operate freely, female BCs face issues beyond work-life balance, including safety concerns and societal expectations.\nAround 33 percent of female BCs mentioned safety concerns, particularly in remote areas, and 35 percent identified cultural barriers as another challenge. These findings suggest a need for systemic support that addresses the unique challenges faced by female BCs, ensuring their safety, reducing cultural stigmas, and providing adequate resources to manage these hurdles.\nA Gendered Perspective\nThe study underscores differing professional development preferences between male and female BCs. While 49 percent of female BCs prefer workshops and seminars to stay updated, 58 percent of men are inclined to read industry publications for growth. This insight into how BCs prefer to upskill could inform training initiatives within the retail sector, ensuring that programs are accessible and appealing to women.\nAdditionally, there is a notable disparity in awareness and access to training opportunities. While 61 percent of men show a higher awareness of professional development opportunities, 47 percent of women feel there is a greater need for supportive policies to bridge these gaps. This difference in access suggests that retail and financial inclusion initiatives need to consider more targeted, inclusive approaches to ensure equal opportunity and growth potential.\nCommunity and Family Support\nInterestingly, around half of the women BCs rely heavily on family support and mentorship to overcome professional challenges, whereas male BCs often turn to external resources, such as training programs. Family and community support networks can play a pivotal role in encouraging and sustaining women in these roles, especially in communities where they are viewed as financial pioneers. By fostering mentorship programs and community support, retail organizations can strengthen the position of female BCs, offering them the resilience to navigate a traditionally male-dominated industry.\nThe Future of Women in BC Operations\nDespite the challenges, women BCs are showing a strong entrepreneurial drive, with 69 percent planning to expand their operations within the next three to five years. This ambition aligns with the broader trend of entrepreneurship flourishing in rural areas, particularly in sectors like retail and small business services. The report indicates that female BCs are not only committed to growth but are actively seeking opportunities to broaden their reach, providing essential banking services to their communities.\nThis trend signals a significant opportunity for retail brands and financial services providers to harness the ambition of female BCs, potentially leveraging this workforce for deeper market penetration and service delivery in underserved regions.\nExpert Insights on the Gender Gap\nThe report includes insightful quotes from industry leaders who emphasize the importance of recognizing and addressing the gender gap within the BC sector. Jayatri Dasgupta, CMO at PayNearby, remarks, \u201cWe have seen firsthand the transformative power of women BCs in bringing essential banking services to the last mile... By addressing these gaps and providing the right support, we can build a more inclusive financial ecosystem for all.\u201d\nBharati Joshi, CEO of Grameen Foundation India, adds, \u201cThe findings of this report highlight the untapped potential of women Business Correspondents in driving financial inclusion across underserved communities... supportive policies, targeted financial assistance, and capacity-building programs.\u201d\nThese expert insights highlight the need for actionable strategies, reinforcing the report\u2019s findings that both men and women BCs can contribute significantly when provided with the right resources and support.\nPathways to Strengthen Women\u2019s Role in Retail Banking\nTo truly unlock the potential of women BCs, the report outlines several strategic recommendations that could be game-changers in the retail sector:\nTargeted Mentorship Programs: Mentorship tailored specifically for women can provide the guidance needed to navigate challenges unique to their roles and communities.\n  Enhanced Training in Customer and Financial Product Management: Addressing the needs for customer care skills, financial product management, and digital literacy\u2014especially cybersecurity\u2014can empower women BCs to handle complex transactions confidently.\n  Access to Development Resources: Expanding access to resources such as online courses and skills workshops is crucial. The convenience of online training is essential, especially given the preference for flexible work schedules among women.\n  Involvement of Local Community Leaders: By engaging leaders at the Panchayat level, women BCs can gain the social recognition necessary to build credibility, fostering greater acceptance and support within their communities.\nA Call for Inclusive Growth in Retail Banking\nThe data presented in the report paints a hopeful picture of what the retail banking landscape could achieve with a stronger focus on gender inclusivity. The contributions of women BCs are evident not only in the higher transaction values they secure but also in their potential to drive financial empowerment across communities. As the retail sector continues to evolve, integrating and uplifting women BCs will be critical to building a balanced, inclusive financial ecosystem that serves all customers more effectively.\nThe journey toward closing the gender gap in rural retail banking may be complex, but the commitment and resilience displayed by women BCs are undeniable. With structured support, targeted training, and an inclusive approach, the industry can harness the full power of women BCs\u2014transforming them into central pillars of financial inclusion and rural economic development.\nFor a retail sector that thrives on customer trust, personalized service, and community connection, the insights from this report are both timely and invaluable.\n  women empowermententrepreneurshipretail India\nNext Story\nRetail & Business\nTop 8 Japanese Whisky Brands in India with Price: A Taste of Japan\nBY - Ria Duneja\nMT Editorial\nNov 13, 2024 / 16 MIN READ\nFollow Us\n  Japanese whisky has become the new craze as consumers the world over are impressed by the new taste and new flavor of Japanese whiskies.

Brands are navigating the challenges and opportunities of the modern wellness landscape, focusing on consumer education, digital innovation, and international outreach. \nThe Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) model has transformed how both new-age and legacy ayurvedic brands connect with customers by eliminating traditional retail channels. This approach fosters direct engagement, enabling brands to build stronger relationships, respond quickly to consumer needs, and enhance loyalty. Through D2C channels, brands can share the story and science behind their Ayurvedic formulations, emphasizing natural ingredients and their benefits. \nThis model has also allowed Ayurvedic brands to effectively leverage digital platforms, social media, and influencers to reach a digitally savvy audience. As a result, educational content on Ayurveda is now more accessible, bridging the gap between traditional wellness practices and modern consumer convenience, and making high-quality Ayurvedic products available with quick and convenient shipping.\nMaharishi Ayurveda\u2019s direct engagement strategy enables them to deliver a personalized experience, while also sharing the story behind their products and the wisdom of Ayurveda. \u201cThe D2C channel has been a game-changer. It has allowed us to reach customers directly, giving them personalised experiences while educating them about the benefits of true Ayurveda.\u201d elaborated Dr. Rini Vohra Shrivastava, Scientific Advisor, Maharishi Ayurveda. \n\u201cIt has made educational content about Ayurveda more accessible, allowing consumers to understand the benefits and science behind the products. This channel, combined with social media, has democratized access to Ayurveda, bridging the gap between tradition and modern convenience,\u201d said Abhilash K Ramesh, Executive Director, Kairali Ayurvedic Group.\nAyurveda Market in India\nThe Ayurvedic and organic beauty market in India has seen a significant boom, propelled by a generational shift toward authenticity and sustainability,\u201d stated Abhilash K Ramesh.\nIndia's Ayurvedic products market, valued at Rs 748.5 billion in 2023, is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17 percent from 2024 to 2032. Likewise, the organic personal care market, worth $721.56 million in 2023, is projected to grow at 14.31 percent through 2029, This growth is driven by India's cultural preference for Ayurvedic ingredients and traditional beauty practices. \nThe trend toward personalized beauty and wellness has picked up pace, and Ayurveda's dosha-based approach appeals to consumers in search of customized care. The ability of Ayurvedic brands to list clear, traceable ingredients about sourcing is another key demand among today's shoppers.\u201d added Astha Jain, Co-founder, Ayuvya.\nYouth Appeal on Ayurveda\nGen Z and Alpha generations are embracing ayurveda for its natural and sustainable approach that promotes true wellness over quick fixes. Unlike conventional products, ayurvedic beauty and personal care brands use safe, chemical-free ingredients that align with their eco-friendly values. \n\u201cThe trend toward personalized beauty and wellness has picked up pace, and Ayurveda's dosha-based approach appeals to consumers in search of customized care. The ability of Ayurvedic brands to list clear, traceable ingredients about sourcing is another key demand among today's shoppers,\u201d explained Astha Jain.\nWith social media influencers showcasing ayurvedic brands, such natural-based products are becoming popular amongst the youth who seek authenticity and care. Today\u2019s consumers prioritize products that are personalized to each skin, hair, and health needs. A significant shift towards minimalism with a preference for simple, multipurpose routines and transparency in ingredients and sourcing is noticed. \nVenkatesh Anilkumar, Founder, Aarshaveda stated, \u201cBoth Gen Z and Alpha are getting exposed to a lot of information from social media and the internet. Ayurveda Beauty products and regimes are now popularized by many influencers and celebrities and most of them are effective too. There is also a huge shift in the younger generation towards products and practices that are natural and eco friendly.\u201d\nPeople are looking beyond surface-level beauty to products that support holistic wellness, focusing on long-term health and preventive care. Clean beauty values ethical sourcing and ingredient clarity which are now essential to consumer choices.\nChallenges in the Digital Age \nDespite its rapid growth, the Ayurvedic beauty market faces significant challenges, especially in the crowded digital space. An abundance of brands claim Ayurvedic origins, but not all uphold the legacy and authenticity that true Ayurveda represents. \n\u201cLogistically, operating as Direct-to-Consumer with seamless delivery and customer service across the country, especially in Tier II, III, and IV cities, is very challenging with logistics and infrastructure. Issues in the above factors need to be addressed so that they may result in a loyal customer base and can sustain growth in such a competitive market,\u201d added Astha Jain.\nEducating consumers about what constitutes genuine Ayurvedic practices is a priority for brands. The need to differentiate from non-authentic competitors that lack standardization or quality testing is vital to maintaining the credibility of the Ayurvedic industry.\n\u201cThe digital space is also overcrowded, with many brands competing to stand out. While some maintain Ayurveda\u2019s legacy, most brands lack standardised and quality-tested products,\u201d commented Dr. Rini Vohra Shrivastava, Scientific Advisor, Maharishi Ayurveda. \nLooking Beyond Borders\nMany Ayurvedic brands are now targeting international markets, where the appeal of holistic wellness continues to grow. Maharishi Ayurveda is already present in over 30 countries, including the EU and USA, and plans to enter Eastern Europe, Australia, and other emerging markets. \n\u201cIn markets where we collaborate with local distributors, we will primarily focus on offline retail to establish a strong brand presence. However, we will retain online rights for these markets, allowing us to enter the e-commerce space when we identify potential for growth,\u201d elaborated Dr. Rini Vohra Shrivastava.\nAyuvya and Kairali are exploring a \u201cdigital-first\u201d approach for international expansion, aiming to test new markets online before establishing physical retail. \n\u201cThis digital-first strategy allows us to reach a global audience while at the same time leveraging the power of community and storytelling to make known the unique qualities of Ayurveda. Our strategy would be to educate the audience about traditional Ayurveda, using UGC ads to create an authentic relationship and instill trust,\u201d claimed Astha Jain.\n\u201cOur initial approach will be through digital retail, allowing us to test markets and understand consumer preferences without the immediate overhead of physical stores. Digital retail also allows for easier regulatory navigation and lets us reach a broader audience with educational content, building a community before physical expansion,\u201d Abhilash K Ramesh.\nAyurveda is planning to study overseas with a specific market and consumer preference approach. It is considering both physical and digital retail options to ensure wide reachability. \nWe plan to consider both physical and digital retail channels, potentially partnering with established distributors and retailers to ensure our products reach a wider audience,\u201d Dr. Sandip Mali, MD, PhD, Ayurveda, Moha.\nThe Indian ayurveda market is projected to grow rapidly and is majorly driven by the younger generation\u2019s pursuit of authenticity, the environment, and individualization. In response to the brand strategy focus on digital innovation and outreach, brands embody the essence of traditional wellness with the global consumer expectation.\n  AyurvedaBeautypersonal careBrands\nNext Story\nRetail & Business\nTop 10 Irish Whisky Brands in India That You\u2019ll Love to Try!\nBY - Saptopriya Ghosal\nJunior Writer\nNov 12, 2024 / 22 MIN READ\nFollow Us\n  There is something special about having an Irish Whisky.

This makes Irish Whisky ideal for those who prefer a smoother, lighter taste without the smokiness.\nAging Process: Irish law mandates that Irish Whisky be aged for at least three years in oak casks, which adds depth to its flavor. While American bourbon must be aged in new charred oak barrels, Irish Whisky is often aged in previously used barrels, such as sherry or wine barrels, lending unique flavors like vanilla, caramel, and fruit.\nPopularity in Cocktails: Due to its smoothness, Irish Whisky is a popular choice in cocktails.

Brands have had to face many challenges, such as fragmented customer experiences, inconsistent messaging across channels, and difficulties in inventory management. Such disorganized interaction with shoppers leaves consumers frustrated, whether shopping online or in-store, thereby leading to lost sales and low brand loyalty. Such omnichannel strategies resolve the issues by offering an easy shopping journey but at the same time give D2C brands an edge over others in the battle to engage with customers and to bring customer satisfaction along with improving the business performance of any organization.\nD2C brands are changing the retail landscape as consumers continue to evolve. According to a new survey, the D2C market is expected to reach $175 billion by 2025, fueled by increasing demand for personalization and direct engagement with brands. More people shopping online only adds to the demand for seamless integration of digital and physical experiences. Studies have revealed that companies that have an excelling omnichannel strategy experience 30 percent retention of customers, whereas the companies that rely strictly on one channel only reach a retention rate of less than 30 percent of the customers. There is no alternative left but to demand omnichannel approaches from the D2C brands even in e-commerce to provide their products in new and existing markets and win new customer loyalty. This article focuses on the need for omni-channel strategies for D2C brands, the challenges that they face, and good practices in implementing this sort of strategy.\nThe Shift from E-Commerce to Omni-Channel\nWith consumers increasingly accustomed to multi-channel shopping experiences, their expectations in terms of convenience, personalization, and instant product availability are changing. A survey reported that omnichannel leaders enjoy 30% higher customer retention rates than a single channel. The evolving reality necessitates a revised approach by the D2C brands in the context of their changing target audience's needs.\nBridging the Digital and Physical Divide\nD2C (Direct-to-Consumer) brands have entered the market predominantly through online sales and have made the most of digital marketing to directly reach their target market.  However, the limitations of e-commerce, such as the reluctance to buy high-involvement products over the Internet, bring about the necessity for a direct experience. D2C can add more value to shopping where customers get to see and feel the products before making a purchase. This can be supported through retail locations, pop-up stores, and partnerships with existing retailers. Such strategies help in building confidence in the brand as well as enhancing exposure.\nAdvantages of Omni-Channel Strategies\nIn today's quickly changing retail world, adopting an omnichannel strategy is critical for businesses aiming to improve customer experience and increase revenue.\nBetter Customer Experience: An omnichannel strategy allows D2C brands to offer a richer and more personalized shopping experience. Data can be collected from multiple channels for better insight into what consumers like, ensuring that marketing is properly customized and tailored to meet those consumer needs. This creates not only more satisfied customers but also those with loyalty and repeat purchasing intentions.\nMore Sales Opportunities: Integrating physical retail with e-commerce provides more sales opportunities. The customer may discover a product online and decide to buy it in-store, or vice versa. This multi-touchpoint approach ensures that brands capture sales at all stages of the customer journey, thereby increasing overall revenue.\nImproved Inventory Management: Omni-channel strategies help manage better stock. The real-time transfer of data between the internet and offline channels helps optimize a brand's stock level at a time, hence overstocking or running into stockouts. It empowers D2C businesses to react to consumers, which improves operational efficiency.\nBrand Awareness and Market Reach: A good omnichannel strategy will increase brand awareness to a great extent. If an online platform fails to resonate with new markets, then building a D2C platform in retail locations is very effective.\nChallenges of Omni-Channel Strategies\nWhile omnichannel strategies have many advantages, they also pose several problems that organizations must overcome to ensure smooth integration and consumer satisfaction.\nSystem and Process Integration: One of the most significant challenges D2C brands face is system and process integration across channels. It is very difficult to ensure the same inventory management, customer relationship management, and sales platforms are unified across the different channels. Such integration is very essential for a seamless experience for the customer.\nBrand Consistency: With D2C brands scaling into omni-channel retail, it becomes a critical need to keep up the consistency of branding in all touchpoints. Different messaging or customer experiences could weaken the brand's identity and dilute trust from the consumers. It requires D2C brands to invest in training and guidelines to make sure the channels represent the same set of brand values and ethos.\nLogistics and Fulfillment: Omni-channel strategies would necessitate strong logistics and fulfillment systems that would back both online and offline sales. D2C brands have to assess their supply chain capabilities against more significant demand, efficient return handling, and timely delivery. Multi-channel fulfillment might overstretch resources and may demand strategic partnerships.\nUnderstanding Customer Data: D2C brands are stronger in terms of data analytics, though aggregation across channels can be challenging. Brands have to invest in tools that help track customer interaction across platforms to derive actionable insights and accordingly refine their marketing strategies.\nBest Practices for Successfully Implementing Omni-Channel Business Approach\nTo fully realize the benefits of an omnichannel business approach, enterprises should implement best practices that streamline operations and improve consumer interaction across all touchpoints.\nInvest in Technologies: D2C needs investment in technology that offers connectivity. Advanced CRM is developed to help brands handle such integration. Advanced applications relating to inventory management help and data analytics aid coordination between online and off-channel operations.\nCustomer First: This omni-channel strategy should always maintain a core focus on the customer experience. Brands must constantly collect feedback and assess how customers interact with them to evolve their offers along with the dynamic change of preferences over time. All services employed within the customer journey should be guided by personalization and convenience.\nForm Strategic Partnerships: One good way to penetrate the omni-channel space for D2C brands is by partnering with existing retailers. Strategic partnerships enable brands to use established distribution networks, gain insight into the market, and establish brand credibility.\nIntegrated Marketing Strategy: Omni-channel success requires a coherent marketing strategy. D2C brands must make sure that there is consistency in the message across channels and use data to effectively target campaigns. The online and offline marketing efforts may be integrated to enhance customer engagement and sales.\nContinuous Improvement: This makes the retail landscape of D2C brands always in innovation mode, which maintains them agile. From the given metrics, customer feedback, and market trends, brands can be better advised to make relevant decisions on how to stay on track.\nIncorporating omni-channel strategies into D2C brands' operations is a key focus in achieving growth targets in modern complex retailing. With a good grasp of customer expectations, technology, and brand management, D2C brands can improve customer experiences, increase their audience base, and enhance revenue. As they work their way around the implementation challenges of omnichannel, they would ensure healthy relationships with their customers and embrace partnerships that would make retail and e-commerce grow healthily in the long run.\n  Authored By\nTarvinder Pal, Co-Founder and CEO, Nisara\n  omnichannelD2CBrands\nNext Story\nRetail & Business\nConcerns Over the Rapid Expansion of E-Commerce in India: Branding, Advertising, and Marketing\nBY - Guest author\nNov 09, 2024 / 11 MIN READ\nFollow Us\n  E-commerce is a completely different beast now than it was 10 years ago. The increase accessibility to cheap smartphones and internet connectivity has led to a rapid rise in e-commerce retail over the past few years, leading to a new revolution when it comes to how people purchase products. \nThe Rise of E-Commerce Giants in India\nExponential growth - The Indian e-commerce market, which was valued at $70 billion in 2023, is expected to grow over $300 billion by 2030. This growth is being driven not just by urban buyers but also by a new wave of consumers from rural areas.\nIncreased Market Penetration \u2013 Although most of these e-commerce services started their lives in the big cities, they have slowly made their way into the rural and semi-rural areas of the country as well. No longer is e-commerce exclusive to the big cities. This expansion is supported by an improved logistics infrastructure and the widespread availability of affordable smartphones and internet connectivity. This deeper market penetration has enabled brands to access a broader customer base, further accelerating their growth and market presence.\nIncreased competition - Such developments have democratized e-commerce, enabling brands to tap into previously underserved markets. As a result, companies like Flipkart, Amazon India, Zepto, and Blinkit have expanded their customer base exponentially, driving both revenue and market presence.\nImpact on traditional retailers - Brick-and-mortar retailers face fierce competition as these digital platforms leverage vast supply chains and technology to offer lower prices and faster delivery. To stay competitive, traditional retailers are forced to integrate online components into their business models, resulting in increased adoption of omnichannel strategies.\nRedefining Branding and Marketing Strategies\nOne thing is certain\u2014the rise of e-commerce has ushered in an era of entirely new branding and marketing strategies, which is understandable given the fundamental shift in how consumers interact with brands today. Traditional approaches no longer suffice in a world where consumers are highly connected, have instant access to information, and expect personalized, seamless shopping experiences.\nE-commerce companies have always prioritized customer experience as the core of their branding efforts. From investing in user-friendly platforms to personalized recommendations, companies pay a lot of money to ensure maximum customer satisfaction.\nPersonalization - Personalization is often part of the course when it comes to customer centric branding. The advent of AI has opened new doors for how brands can personalize based on user data. \nSpeed - Speed has also become an important aspect of modern e-commerce. From same-day delivery options by companies like Amazon and Flipkart, to quick commerce services like Zepto and Blinkit, there is a there is a growing emphasis on delivering goods faster than ever before.\nBrand differentiation - With so many players in the market, creating a unique brand identity is tough. Platforms often rely on discounts and promotions, making it difficult for smaller or newer brands to compete without undermining their value.\nBalancing Local and Global Appeal - Sometimes, there\u2019s the challenge of maintaining a global image while balancing local appeal. This includes catering to regional tastes by localizing content, such as offering support in regional languages and promoting culturally relevant products.\nBuilding Trust and Loyalty in the Digital Marketplace\nThen there\u2019s the matter of trust. Unlike physical retailers, where the customer-retailer interaction is more personal, the digital marketplace introduces another layer of uncertainty. This can make customers hesitant, especially first-time online shoppers in India.\nEstablishing Consumer Trust - In a country like India, where the number of online customers is increasing daily, building trust is key. Concerns over product quality, payment security, and return policies remain significant barriers.\nLoyalty Programs and Customer Retention - Platforms like Amazon Prime and Flipkart Plus have introduced loyalty programs to keep customers engaged. These programs, combined with reliable delivery and customer support, are essential for fostering long-term relationships and encouraging repeat purchases.\nThe Shift from Traditional to Digital Advertising\nIncreased Focus on Digital Ads \u2013 Digital advertising has become the primary marketing tool for most retailers. Brands are allocating more budget toward online ads.\nHyper-Targeted Ads and Ethical Concerns \u2013 I talked about personalization before. The ability to target specific consumers with personalized ads is a powerful tool, but it also raises concerns about privacy. Retailers and platforms collect extensive data on user behavior, often without clear communication about how that data is used.\nDealing with Ad Fatigue - While digital advertising is highly effective, consumers are increasingly experiencing ad fatigue due to the sheer volume of targeted content they encounter daily. Finding the right balance is also important.\nSustainability and Environmental Impact \u2013 The matter of how e-commerce leads to environmental concerns is not new. From packaging waste to the carbon footprint of deliveries, consumers are demanding more sustainable practices from retailers, there\u2019s a shift in the customer mindset.\nThe Importance of Omnichannel Marketing\nCombining Online and Offline Channels \u2013 An omnichannel approach might be the way forward for most retailers. Platforms like Tata Cliq and Reliance Trends offer click-and-collect services, giving consumers more flexibility in how they shop. This seamless integration helps retailers meet the diverse needs of their customers, who expect convenience across both digital and physical touchpoints.\nConclusion: Sustainable Growth Requires Balance\nThe e-commerce landscape will continue to grow in India, there is no doubt about it. As more companies enter the market, it\u2019s essential for brands to strike a balance between rapid growth and sustainable practices. Success in this competitive scene will largely depend on how brands approach ethical and environmental concerns, while also balancing effective advertising strategies with consumer trust and engagement. Ultimately, achieving sustainable growth in India's booming e-commerce market will require thoughtful strategies that integrate innovation, ethical marketing, and a genuine commitment to sustainability. Those who can balance these aspects will be well-positioned to thrive in the long term.\n  Authored By\nSomdutta Singh, First-Generation Serial Entrepreneur, Founder and CEO Assiduus, Angel Investor\n  e-commerceexpansionQuick Commerce\nNext Story\nRetail & Business\nTop 10 Denim Jacket Brands in India for Every Style and Budget!\nBY - Saptopriya Ghosal\nJunior Writer\nNov 08, 2024 / 17 MIN READ\nFollow Us\n  What is absolutely essential is a denim jacket.

Fuelled by a surge in regional shopping, high-value purchases, and evolving consumer preferences, the season set new standards for online shopping in the country. Two industry reports\u2014by Unicommerce and ClickPost\u2014delve into the key metrics, trends, and shifts that defined this Diwali season, revealing the power of digital marketplaces to reach every corner of the nation and deliver a seamless experience to millions of shoppers.\nE-commerce Booms with 14 Percent Growth in Volume and Rising GMV\nAccording to Unicommerce, a major SaaS platform for e-commerce enablement, this year\u2019s festive season witnessed a notable 14 percent growth in order volumes over the previous year. Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) also jumped, climbing over 18 percent compared to 2023\u2019s Diwali sales. From Navratri to Diwali, the shopping spree was sustained by significant discounts and promotions. The shopping momentum peaked during the early days of the sale, though promotions continued through various festivals, including Dussehra, Dhanteras, and Govardhan Puja.\nNewer e-commerce categories were among the biggest winners in 2024. Both travel accessories and health devices experienced over 100 percent YoY growth, reflecting increased consumer interest in wellness and travel gear. The gaming accessories sector also recorded significant success, with an 85 percent YoY increase in order volume. Traditional categories, however, remained strong: beauty and makeup products saw over 100 percent growth, toys and baby products registered a 50 percent increase, and kids' apparel followed with a 30 percent rise. Additionally, dietary foods, healthy snacks, and supplements saw a 40 percent uptick, while kitchenware noted a 30 percent boost in orders.\nTier II and III Cities Drive E-commerce Sales\nTier II and III cities emerged as essential markets for the festive season, representing a profound shift in the regional balance of e-commerce. ClickPost\u2019s data reveals that over 60 percent of Diwali sales originated from Tier II and III cities, a notable increase from the 55 percent contribution last year. A significant rise in traffic, up by 45 percent from these areas, reflects the rising appetite for online shopping among India\u2019s smaller towns. Notably, 85 percent of shoppers on Amazon\u2019s Great Indian Festival came from non-metro regions, signaling a major expansion of digital access and infrastructure in these cities.\nUnicommerce\u2019s data further highlights this trend, showing that Tier III cities claimed a 36.4 percent share in order volume, compared to 23.5 percent from Tier II towns. Metropolitan areas and Tier I cities, however, retained the largest market share at 40.1 percent. The regional markets, spurred by targeted promotions and better internet access, underscore the growing inclusivity and reach of India\u2019s e-commerce ecosystem.\nHigh-Value Purchases and Rising Average Order Values\nDiwali 2024 wasn\u2019t just about the volume of orders; the season was marked by a surge in high-value purchases across multiple categories. According to ClickPost, GMV increased by 23 percent, with premium products in electronics, fashion, and home decor leading the way. Electronics commanded an average order value (AOV) of Rs 38,000, driven by demand for personal technology and smart home gadgets. Festive apparel in the fashion category contributed to an AOV increase from Rs 3,500 in September to Rs 4,000 in October. Home decor items also saw an AOV rise, reaching Rs 7,900, highlighting consumers\u2019 preference for quality investments this season.\n\u201cDiwali wasn\u2019t just about deals; it was about quality purchases, from personal tech to fashionable, festive apparel,\u201d remarked Naman Vijay, Co-founder of ClickPost. This trend was further supported by cashback offers and no-cost EMI options, encouraging shoppers to invest in high-value items thoughtfully.\nCOD Dominates Non-Metros, Digital Payments Rise in Cities\nPayment trends during the festive season revealed the distinct preferences of India\u2019s urban and rural consumers. In smaller cities and towns, Cash-on-Delivery (COD) remained the dominant mode, with a 3:1 ratio of COD over prepaid transactions in categories like cosmetics and fashion. Meanwhile, in metros and urban centers, digital payments surged, with consumers increasingly drawn to prepaid options, supported by cashback and wallet rewards on big-ticket purchases. The popularity of COD in non-metro areas underscores the need for e-commerce platforms to adapt to varied consumer payment preferences, catering to both traditional and digital-savvy buyers.\n20 percent Boost in Hyperlocal Partners for Faster Delivery\nOne of the defining features of Diwali 2024 was the speed and efficiency of deliveries. Thanks to a 20 percent increase in hyperlocal partnerships, the average delivery time dropped to just 2.5 days, achieving a 95 percent Estimated Delivery Date (EDD) accuracy rate. Same-day and next-day delivery options became common, meeting the high expectations of last-minute shoppers. This improvement reflects an increasingly robust logistics infrastructure that\u2019s able to handle high volumes without compromising on speed.\nAs ClickPost\u2019s Naman Vijay pointed out, \u201cPain points like on-time delivery, RTOs, and customer experience are skillfully tackled, even with the festive rush acting as a stress test for the logistics network. This is proof that data-driven supply chains don\u2019t just meet demand; they elevate customer satisfaction and drive rapid growth for Indian brands.\u201d\nImproved Customer Retention and Satisfaction\nReturns and post-purchase experiences were carefully managed during the 2024 festive season, with noticeable improvements in return rates across several categories. For instance, returns in the electronics and gaming accessories sectors fell from 20.5 percent in 2023 to 16 percent in 2024, while travel accessories saw a decrease from 20.2 percent to 18 percent.

The festive season played a crucial role, driving demand across ethnic snacks and sweets, positioning Bikaji as a frontrunner in the ethnic snacks market.\nDeepak Agarwal, Managing Director of Bikaji Foods International Limited, emphasized the company\u2019s strategic growth amid challenges, \u201cWe are delighted to inform our stakeholders that our company has demonstrated strong performance across all the categories. This quarter we have witnessed a significant jump in revenue and profit margins. This surge in growth is due to the demand in Ethnic Snacks and Packaged Sweets on account of Festive seasonality impact. Overall contribution of Packaged Sweets has jumped to 17.5 percent this quarter, which is again due to festive play. Despite facing significant inflationary challenges, we successfully maintained our margin profile while achieving robust volume growth.

The company\u2019s EBITDA stood at Rs 157 crore, and while challenging conditions persisted, Shoppers Stop doubled down on its commitment to premiumization, investing significantly in high-value product lines and the beauty segment.\nKavindra Mishra, MD and CEO of Shoppers Stop Ltd, reflected on the quarter, \u201cDespite a challenging external environment, we remained resilient in our pursuit to deliver growth. Shoppers Stop delivered notable financial results though the demand was muted in July and August, impacted by fewer wedding dates, extended rains, and overall weak discretionary spending. We kept a relentless focus on investing behind our Premium Category, with increased offerings in Premium Category this quarter.

Profit after tax surged by 16.2 percent to Rs 395.1 crore, demonstrating the success of Colgate\u2019s premiumization and brand loyalty strategies. In Q2 FY25, Colgate fortified its portfolio with new launches and ramped up its advertising spend by 17.8 percent to maintain its leadership in the oral care market.\nPrabha Narasimhan, Managing Director & CEO of Colgate-Palmolive (India) Limited, shared insights into the company\u2019s strategies, \u201cWe are pleased with the robust, consistent topline performance in a tough operating environment.

This strategic move aligns with the growing demand for ethnic wear in the Indian market, tapping into the deep-rooted cultural heritage of India while catering to modern tastes.\n\u201cAs we venture into the ready-made ethnic wear category, we aim to position Devo as a key player in men\u2019s occasion wear, reflecting a fusion of style, tradition, and modernity,\u201d said Gaurav Poddar, Executive Director, Siyaram's.\nInspiration Behind Devo\nThe idea of Devo stems from a desire to reconnect with Indian culture and values, a sentiment that resonates strongly with today's consumers. As Indian ethnic wear gains traction in the fashion industry, the ethos of \"Coming Home to Siyaram\u2019s\" underscores the brand\u2019s commitment to honoring its legacy while embracing modern trends. Devo aims to provide a unique occasion-driven wardrobe for men, reflecting their connection to Indian traditions while ensuring they stand out in a crowded market. The focus on quality fabrics, design innovations, and occasion-specific attire sets the brand apart from competitors.\n\u201cIndian ethnic wear is no longer restricted to weddings or festivals. It has become a part of everyday dressing for men, with kurtas and sherwanis making their way into casual wardrobes. Devo is our way of responding to this trend and creating a brand that stays true to its Indian roots while appealing to the modern man,\u201d shared Poddar.\nLeveraging Siyaram\u2019s Legacy\nWhat truly differentiates Devo from other players in the ethnic menswear market is its strong foundation in fabric expertise. With over four decades of experience in textiles, Siyaram\u2019s brings a deep understanding of fabrics, yarns, and design to Devo\u2019s collections. This legacy gives the brand a distinct edge, enabling it to create unique and high-quality ethnic wear that caters to a wide range of consumer preferences.\n\u201cThe fact that we are inherently a fabric brand, with 45 years of legacy, plays a significant role in the development of new collections and products for the Indian consumer. This deep-rooted understanding of fabrics allows us to innovate in a way that few other brands can,\u201d he explained.\nPositioning Devo\nDevo is designed for men aged 18 to 40, but its appeal extends to older demographics as well. The brand focuses on occasion wear, offering a wide range of products that cater to weddings, festivals, poojas, and even casual ethnic dressing. The core product offerings include Sherwanis, Indo-Western ensembles, Jodhpuris, Kurta-pyjamas, and Tuxedos, alongside a variety of accessories like shoes and malas that complete the look. This wide range ensures that Devo can cater to men looking for both traditional and modern ethnic wear.\nDevo\u2019s pricing is positioned in the mid-to-premium range, making it accessible to a broad audience while maintaining an aura of exclusivity and quality. The aim is to provide stylish, high-quality ethnic wear at a price point that appeals to a wide demographic, from young men looking for trendy occasion wear to older consumers seeking timeless, traditional attire.\nRetail Strategy and Expansion Plans\nDevo\u2019s launch marks the beginning of a retail-first model, with a strong focus on offline stores to build brand presence and establish a personal connection with consumers. The first store, strategically located in Lajpat Nagar, Delhi, serves as the flagship outlet, capitalizing on the city\u2019s status as a fashion hub and a key market for ethnic wear consumption. The decision to start in Delhi was a calculated one, given its vibrant fashion culture and the growing demand for ethnic men\u2019s wear in North India.\nSiyaram\u2019s plans to open 10 to 12 Devo stores by March, all of which will be company-owned to maintain control over brand positioning and consumer experience. However, as the brand expands, franchising may become an option to scale quickly. For now, the focus remains on perfecting the proof of concept with company-owned outlets before bringing in partners.\n\u201cWe are looking at a cluster-based approach, starting with Delhi and surrounding cities, including parts of eastern UP. This will help us consolidate our efforts and fine-tune our understanding of the consumer before expanding further,\u201d stated Poddar.\nFuture Growth\nLooking ahead, Siyaram\u2019s has ambitious plans for Devo\u2019s growth. While the initial focus is on physical stores, the brand intends to adopt an omnichannel approach in the future, with its own e-commerce platform to complement offline sales. This will ensure that Devo reaches a wider audience and allows consumers to shop seamlessly across channels. As the ethnic wear market continues to grow and become more organized, Siyaram\u2019s is confident that Devo will become a key player in the segment, filling a gap for high-quality, well-designed ethnic wear for men.\n\u201cEthnic wear is becoming more and more prominent in men\u2019s wardrobes today, and we see tremendous potential for growth. We are confident that Devo will resonate with consumers, offering them the perfect blend of tradition and modernity,\u201d he concluded.\n  siyaramMenswearIndian ethnic brand\nNext Story\nRetail & Business\nThe Neighborhood Mall: A Crucial Element in Urban Development and Community Building\nBY - Guest author\nNov 02, 2024 / 7 MIN READ\nFollow Us\n  Neighborhood malls have established themselves as the key drivers in offering rapid, easy, and available shopping experiences to the local communities. In fact, these malls have grown to be appreciated in every locality through the provision of wide-ranging amenities within easy reach. From having a place to say, \"Let's have a cup of coffee\" with friends to go for a quick grocery or household shopping, the neighborhood malls have become the hub of our day-to-day lives. In metro cities like Delhi-NCR, especially in areas like Ghaziabad, they serve as accessible social hubs where people meet, interact, and enjoy leisure activities.\nOver the years, neighborhood malls have steadily increased in Delhi-NCR and have changed the retail landscape in the region. These malls that cater to convenience and community have not only backed the commercial realty growth of areas such as Ghaziabad but reflect consumers' increasing preference for organized retail environments. Moreover, fast urbanization and the changes it brings about in social behavior find neighborhood malls serving the needs of residents for a change in lifestyle and immediacy to shopping, dining, and entertainment. These malls boast stunning national and international brand options for dining and lifestyle, and of course, food and entertainment zones catering to families. Because a neighborhood mall is located close to the residential community, it saves one from traveling all the way to far-off shopping complexes. Such accessibility improves the livability of the place, as core services are close by.\nBesides, these malls resonate with the technological revolution, offering technology-competent solutions for urban living. Neighborhood malls enhance customer satisfaction and increase footfall by integrating AI to analyze shopper behavior, predict preferences, and optimize store layouts. Through such technologies, these malls bridge the gap between online and in-store shopping, providing every visitor with a seamless and personalized shopping experience. Also, through extensive renovation, the neighborhood malls emerge with a distinctive design, offering more space and a smoke-free environment, facilitated by a network of elevators and escalators, backed up by an electronically manned computer-operated security system, making it more equipped with technology and digital fronts.\nFurther, with a focus on supporting the government's smart city initiative, neighborhood malls keep sustainability at the core of their operations. Various malls install an advanced RO system to reduce reliance on municipal water, with the refuse from RO treatment used for horticulture. They install sewage and treatment plants to recycle water for irrigation and automated systems like lighting and air conditioning to improve energy efficiency. In addition, these malls reuse construction materials to minimize their carbon footprint. All these measures enhance the mall\u2019s operational efficiency while positioning it as a sustainable shopping destination.\nFurther, local malls contribute to community interaction. In their various 'trending' activities during different seasons, these malls tend to attract huge footfalls where people from all age groups come together. By organizing exhibitions, cultural events, and other activities, the malls become one sort of center of traditional events that allow local visitors and residents to interact with each other and build more healthy community bonding.\nWhat further adds to the appeal of neighborhood malls is the direct contribution of employment and enhancement of economic viability in that area. In such malls, kiosks, shops, or service providers provide ample avenues for local entrepreneurs to set up a base and gain from the footfall and consumer requirements. In addition, neighborhood malls offer retail space for local businesses and entrepreneurs. In the second quarter of 2024, leasing of retail spaces in malls was up 15 percent, thereby allowing the smaller business enterprises to go toe-to-toe with the larger brands and helping local businesses grow. By reaching local consumers and enriching their shopping experience with quality products, these malls strengthen customer loyalty and the area\u2019s economy.\nThus, neighborhood malls have emerged as essential hubs in the rapidly urbanizing Delhi-NCR region. From accessible and convenient services and strengthening community engagement to contributing to the growth of the local economy, these malls act as the pillars of urban life, solidifying their role in future urban developments.\n  Authored By:\n Gaurav Gulati, Managing Director, CCPL\n  MallsNeighborhood MallRapid Urbanization\nNext Story\nRetail & Business\nTop Saree Brands for Every Occasion: Drape Yourself in Tradition\nBY - Ria Duneja\nMT Editorial\nOct 30, 2024 / 13 MIN READ\nFollow Us\n  India is a country rich in diverse cultures and traditions, and one of its most treasured symbols of heritage is the saree.

Industry veterans and top brands share their insights on consumer preferences, market shifts, and seasonal highlights, revealing a marked inclination toward fine jewelry that marries timeless beauty with contemporary allure. With a blend of modern classics, high-end diamonds, and even lab-grown options making their way into consumer baskets, the jewelry industry is on the cusp of a golden era in more ways than one.\nGrowth Driven by Premium Jewelry\nAccording to Zeba Khan, Director of Fashion and Beauty at Amazon India, premium fashion jewelry has become a major driver of demand. This season has seen a significant upswing in sales of luxury watches, gold, and diamond jewelry, with an added twist: lab-grown diamonds are making their mark as an affordable and sustainable choice. Khan highlights, \"Precious jewelry sales have surged by 5X, and there has been an 84 percent year-on-year spike in gold jewelry purchases.\"\nFor Amazon India, which offers over 5 lakh styles in silver, gold, and diamond jewelry, the rise in demand has been further accelerated by seasonal events like Dhanteras and Akshaya Tritiya. The marketplace has recorded a growing preference for 14K purity gold, ideal for daily wear, which has seen a 2.5X year-over-year increase, alongside an impressive 75 percent growth in demand for 18K jewelry. Prices range from RS 2,000 for silver jewelry to RS 40,000 for gold and diamonds, catering to a broad spectrum of buyers. The trust in Amazon\u2019s extensive selection and authentic products makes it a favored destination for festive shopping, especially for hallmarked gold and silver coins.\n\"Amazon offers the widest range of gold coins across price points, suiting all needs of customers. The most bought grammage in units is 2g,\" Khan shares, emphasizing how the marketplace continues to adapt to the evolving tastes of Indian consumers.\nStrong Revenue Growth in India and Abroad\nKalyan Jewellers, a stalwart in the Indian jewelry market, has recorded a 37 percent growth in consolidated revenue over the last quarter. The company's India operations saw an impressive 39 percent revenue surge, driven by same-store sales growth of 23 percent. This growth momentum was aided by a reduction in customs duty on gold imports, which attracted increased footfall. Furthermore, Kalyan's Middle East division reported 24 percent revenue growth, showcasing the brand's international appeal.\nAs Kalyan Jewellers expands its presence with 15 Franchisee-Owned-Company-Operated (FOCO) showrooms in India and the Middle East, they also focus on digital engagement through their online-first brand, Candere, which achieved 30 percent revenue growth in the past quarter. The company has plans for ambitious expansion, with over 130 new showrooms set to launch this year, including the first U.S. location by Diwali. \"The festive season has just started, and we are gearing up with showroom launches, fresh collections, and campaigns,\" the brand shared in a recent statement. With a physical presence growing worldwide, Kalyan is setting the stage for a festive season that is sure to shine brightly.\nRegional Flavors Meet National Appeal\nAjoy Chawla, CEO of the Jewelry Division at Titan Company Ltd., notes the robust festive response from customers, with notable trends seen across different regions of India. \"The South and East regions were off to a quick growth from day one of Navratras, while West and North picked up steam from Dussehra weekend,\" he shares. Among Titan\u2019s offerings, the block-buster Nav-Raani collection by Tanishq and the Disco-themed collection by Mia are witnessing high demand. The brand\u2019s \u2018Aalo\u2019 collection, tailored specifically for West Bengal, has been instrumental in driving sales during the Pujo season.\nIn addition, Titan has launched a 'Festival of Exchange,' encouraging customers to bring in old locker gold and exchange it for new designs, a strategic move to address high gold prices. With Dhanteras set over two days, Titan expects even more customers to indulge in jewelry purchases as a celebratory offering to Goddess Lakshmi. Chawla adds, \"We are hoping to witness a truly celebratory festive indulgence across all customer segments.\"\nA Modern Twist on Traditional Designs\nAt PP Jewellers by Pawan Gupta, Director Piyush Gupta emphasizes a shift in customer preferences toward modern designs that hold traditional value. \"As we approach Diwali 2024, we anticipate a robust growth in the jewelry market, driven by a growth in consumer confidence and love for traditional celebrations,\" says Gupta. Gold remains a staple, but diamond jewelry, particularly designs that appeal to younger customers, is gaining traction.\nThis Diwali, PP Jewellers is committed to offering an enhanced shopping experience through both online and offline platforms. Their new collection balances tradition with contemporary flair, allowing customers to choose pieces that resonate with their personal style. \"Our priority this year highlights the emotional significance of jewelry in festive celebrations,\" Gupta remarks, underscoring the brand\u2019s goal to make this season unforgettable for its customers.\nExclusive Offers and Timeless Craftsmanship\nRohan Narang, Director at Hazoorilal Legacy, speaks to the importance of Dhanteras in boosting jewelry sales, especially as families prepare for the festive and wedding seasons. \"Dhanteras is a highly auspicious time for purchasing jewelry, and with the upcoming wedding season, it becomes the perfect moment to invest in statement gold and diamond pieces,\" he explains. Hazoorilal Legacy is offering a flat 40 percent off on diamond and polki jewelry, and 30 percent off on making charges for 22KT BTS hallmarked gold jewelry, making luxury accessible for a limited time.\nHazoorilal has also launched its flagship Legacy Collection 2024-25, a high-end line that represents the brand's rich heritage. Narang shares, \"Each family member plays an integral role in the creation of this flagship collection, from the initial concept to the final creation.\" With carefully selected gemstones and designs that span traditional polki sets to modern diamond solitaires, Hazoorilal\u2019s latest offerings embody sophistication and quality craftsmanship.\nA Marriage of Tradition and Modernity\nFounder Leshna Shah of Irasva Fine Jewellery shares the optimism that comes with the festive season, particularly Dhanteras. \"Dhanteras marks the commencement of the festive season, and we anticipate a significant surge in sales,\" says Shah. Irasva\u2019s new Amara collection, a perfect blend of heritage and contemporary design, is already a customer favorite.\nIn response to the increasing demand for unique, high-quality pieces, Irasva has crafted collections that cater to discerning tastes. Shah notes, \"Our expertly crafted offerings surpass customer expectations, especially as jewelry purchases become a cherished tradition during this period.\" The brand's offerings are a testament to the evolving preferences of Indian consumers, who seek jewelry that holds cultural significance while being distinctively modern.\nThe Rise of Lab-Grown Diamonds and Minimalist Trends\nThe jewelry industry has also witnessed an increasing demand for lab-grown diamonds, a trend driven by both sustainability concerns and pricing accessibility. Amazon\u2019s Zeba Khan highlights, \"Customers can now buy gold and silver jewelry with lab-grown diamonds starting at attractive prices of RS 2,500.\" This introduction of lab-grown diamonds to Amazon\u2019s inventory has added over 50,000 styles, making the online marketplace a one-stop shop for those looking for eco-friendly options.\nIn addition to lab-grown diamonds, there\u2019s also a visible shift toward minimalist jewelry, particularly among younger buyers. As Piyush Gupta of PP Jewellers observes, \"The balance between heavy and minimalist designs is evolving, showing a desire for commonness in festive outfits.\" Consumers are leaning toward pieces that are both stylish and versatile, reflecting a broader trend of practical luxury that suits daily wear and special occasions alike.\nExpanding Markets and Customer-Centric Innovations\nAcross the board, the Indian jewelry industry is expanding its footprint and enhancing customer experiences, both in-store and online. With brands like Kalyan Jewellers and Candere launching showrooms across multiple regions, from the Middle East to the United States, the accessibility of Indian jewelry is on the rise globally. This expansion reflects the strong international appeal of Indian craftsmanship, especially during festivals like Diwali that resonate with the Indian diaspora worldwide.\nBrands are also focusing on innovation in customer engagement, offering flexible shopping options, and personalized experiences. \"Our priority this year is to deliver an excellent experience that truly resonates with our customers,\" Gupta from PP Jewellers says, underlining a commitment shared by other industry players. By offering virtual try-ons, digital consultations, and exclusive festive discounts, brands are making jewelry shopping as convenient and satisfying as possible.\nA Sparkling Season of Innovation and Tradition\nThis festive season, the Indian jewelry industry is poised for impressive growth as brands bring together the best of traditional craftsmanship and modern innovation. With an eye on sustainability, a preference for diverse designs, and a commitment to customer convenience, the industry is setting the stage for a sparkling season. As Ajoy Chawla of Titan Company sums it up, \"We are hoping to witness a truly celebratory festive indulgence across all customer segments and markets.\"\nFrom Amazon\u2019s extensive selection of lab-grown diamonds to Hazoorilal Legacy\u2019s exclusive offers, Indian consumers are spoiled for choice this season. The market trends reflect a promising future where jewelry continues to be an integral part of cultural celebrations, personal milestones, and, increasingly, as a symbol of contemporary luxury.

At the heart of this evolution are visionary leaders, government initiatives, and nurturing mentorship programs that support ambitious beauty entrepreneurs. Falguni Nayar, Founder and CEO of Nykaa, Sanjiv Singh, Joint Secretary at the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), and Shana Randhava, Senior Vice President of The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies New Incubation Ventures, recently shared their insights on the D2C beauty industry's explosive growth, the empowering of new brands, and the supportive structures bolstering these entrepreneurs.\n1. Fueling the Aspiration for Beauty and Growth\nIn a world where digital access is reshaping consumer behavior and fostering new brands, Falguni Nayar underscores the importance of a robust ecosystem that supports D2C beauty ventures. \u201cTo succeed in such a competitive environment in India, it\u2019s crucial to have a strong community of investors, creative talent, product experts, and tech leaders who can help brands develop their narrative, shape solutions, and deliver products and services,\u201d says Nayar. This ecosystem-driven approach has allowed Indian beauty brands to emerge with unique offerings that resonate with both metropolitan and Tier 2 and 3 cities.\nNayar also highlights Nykaa\u2019s role in catalyzing trends in India, especially with the release of the Nykaa Beauty Trends Report, which forecasts key directions for the Indian market. From the growing importance of sun protection to the increasing demand for premium beauty, Nykaa\u2019s insights are shaping the trajectory for a new wave of D2C beauty brands in India. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen significant momentum in categories that were once underrepresented,\u201d she explains. \u201cIndian consumers are becoming more conscious of beauty needs, and the industry\u2019s growth has accelerated to more than 11%.\u201d\n2. Government Backing for India\u2019s Beauty Entrepreneurs\nThe DPIIT has recognized India\u2019s potential as a leading beauty and personal care market, fueled by a population with rising aspirations and a hunger for premium products. Sanjiv Singh, Joint Secretary, articulates the significance of supporting homegrown ventures, especially in the burgeoning premium category. \u201cIndia is the place to be,\u201d says Singh. \u201cOur aspirational population of 1.4 billion is willing to invest in high-quality products. The government is committed to providing assistance and quality standards to ensure that Indian consumers receive the best.\u201d\nSingh speaks to the government's efforts to make the beauty industry more accessible for emerging brands, with quality control measures and initiatives that bridge the gap between major urban centers and rural areas. Singh notes, \u201cNearly 50% of India\u2019s 1.5 lakh recognized startups come from Tier II and Tier III cities, showing that there\u2019s a massive demand beyond metro hubs.\u201d Programs like Startup Mahakumbh and Beauty&You are essential, he adds, as they address funding and mentorship, two of the most significant barriers for startups. The government\u2019s role, Singh emphasizes, is about fostering an ecosystem that allows startups to thrive, with programs like \u201cBhaskar\u201d providing a platform for connecting startups with investors and mentors.\n3. BEAUTY&YOU India: Empowering the Future of Beauty\nThe BEAUTY&YOU India initiative, a joint venture between Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies and Nykaa, is a pioneering program aimed at supporting the next generation of beauty entrepreneurs. Established in 2022, the program has evolved to embrace not only beauty-focused startups but also innovators from adjacent fields such as content creation and cultural ambassadorship. \u201cBEAUTY&YOU India has progressively evolved to support a broader range of founders,\u201d shares Shana Randhava. She adds, \u201cYear one was about nurturing beauty-focused startups, but as we saw the diverse talents in India, we expanded our scope to include hyper-localized brands and niche participants.\u201d\nEach year, BEAUTY&YOU India has introduced elements like the \u201cLuminaries,\u201d a segment dedicated to celebrating cultural icons who use beauty to drive significant social conversations. Randhava highlights, \u201cToday\u2019s beauty influencers are investors, creative storytellers, ambassadors, and innovators. They are driving beauty\u2019s connection to cultural conversations, and we celebrate these visionaries as part of our program.\u201d This strategic shift aligns with the global push to view beauty as more than just a product, recognizing it as an experience and a platform for self-expression and cultural commentary.\n4. Success Stories from BEAUTY&YOU India\nThe impact of BEAUTY&YOU India has been profound, with many past winners achieving recognition and growth. One notable success is Skinvest, a skincare brand that won the \u201cGrow\u201d category in the program\u2019s first year. According to its founder, Divya Malpani, the recognition from BEAUTY&YOU provided not only visibility but also invaluable resources and support that were pivotal for the brand\u2019s growth. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the recognition,\u201d Malpani noted, \u201cbut the ongoing support and guidance that has helped us reach audiences both nationally and internationally.\u201d\nThe program\u2019s collaboration with Nykaa offers a unique advantage by leveraging Nykaa\u2019s deep market insights and distribution network, providing startups with a powerful launchpad. \u201cThe partnership with Nykaa has been crucial,\u201d says Randhava. \u201cNykaa\u2019s understanding of consumer behavior in India, combined with Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s global experience, creates a synergistic platform that supports breakthrough products and experiences relevant to the local market.\u201d\n5. Looking Forward: The Future of India\u2019s Beauty Market\nIndia\u2019s beauty market is poised to grow exponentially in the coming years, driven by shifting consumer preferences, increasing disposable incomes, and a burgeoning entrepreneurial ecosystem. Randhava envisions a future where India becomes a global hub for beauty innovation, with local brands that compete on the world stage. \u201cBEAUTY&YOU India will continue to be a vibrant platform for supporting founders,\u201d she says. \u201cWe aim to empower founders with tools and resources to amplify unique voices and perspectives within the global beauty community.\u201d\nEchoing Randhava\u2019s sentiments, Nayar sees the future as a blend of digital and in-store experiences, catering to both the digital-native Gen Z and a diverse array of beauty consumers. \u201cNykaa\u2019s retail network and e-commerce platform open up distribution for emerging brands, offering visibility across India,\u201d Nayar notes. \u201cOur mission is to help these brands grow and reach their full potential, and we\u2019re proud to support their journey.\u201d\n6. Empowering Beauty Entrepreneurs: The Road Ahead\nThe thriving D2C beauty landscape in India is a testament to the efforts of both private players and government initiatives working in synergy. With Nykaa\u2019s ecosystem of support, DPIIT\u2019s commitment to quality and accessibility, and BEAUTY&YOU India\u2019s platform for innovation, the future of beauty entrepreneurship in India looks promising. As Randhava, Nayar, and Singh emphasize, the journey of building a D2C brand in India is challenging but filled with unprecedented opportunities for those willing to take bold steps.\n\u201cThe success of beauty startups today is not just about creating a product,\u201d Singh concludes, \u201cit\u2019s about building an ecosystem that supports entrepreneurs, ensuring that India becomes a global leader in the beauty space.\u201d With industry stalwarts like Nykaa and Est\u00e9e Lauder leading the way, the future of beauty in India shines brightly, poised to redefine beauty on the world stage.\n    BeautyD2Cretail Indiaindia retailIndian Beauty Industry\nNext Story\nRetail & Business\n6 Exquisite Diwali Gift Hampers to Bring Joy to Your Celebrations\nBY - Saptopriya Ghosal\nJunior Writer\nOct 24, 2024 / 12 MIN READ\nFollow Us\n  As the festival of Diwali approaches, gifting has taken centre stage, with brands unveiling exquisite hampers to celebrate this joyous occasion.

This follows a lukewarm performance in FY2024, when the sector faced multiple challenges such as high retail inventories, sluggish demand from key markets, and intensifying competition from neighboring countries. However, a combination of factors, including the gradual liquidation of retail inventory in key markets like the United States and the European Union, as well as a shift in global sourcing to India, is now setting the stage for a much-needed revival.\nFactors Driving Growth in FY2025\nThe revenue expansion expected in FY2025 for Indian apparel exporters is primarily driven by a global de-risking strategy, where several international buyers are shifting sourcing to India. This trend is part of a broader move by companies to diversify their supply chains, reducing their reliance on any one country, particularly in light of the ongoing geopolitical uncertainties. Additionally, the liquidation of retail inventories that had built up over the past year is expected to boost orders in key markets.\nRetailers in major markets like the US and EU, which together account for over two-thirds of India's apparel exports, are now focusing on replenishing stock levels ahead of the upcoming spring and summer seasons. Indian exporters are also benefitting from heightened demand for man-made fibers and other value-added segments, which have gained favor in international markets.\nAccording to Srikumar Krishnamurthy, Senior Vice President & Co-Group Head \u2013 Corporate Ratings at ICRA, \u201cAfter a marginal decline of 2 percent in FY2024, Indian apparel exporters are projected to report a 9-11 percent revenue growth in FY2025. This is mainly attributed to the derisking strategies adopted by various customers and the replenishment of retail inventory in key end markets, especially in the US and EU regions.\u201d\nOvercoming Challenges from FY2024\nFY2024 was marked by a host of challenges that dampened the performance of Indian apparel exporters. The sector was hit by sluggish demand from key international markets, supply chain disruptions, and heightened competition from neighboring countries like Bangladesh.\nSeveral factors led to this downturn. High retail inventory levels in the US and EU meant that retailers were hesitant to place new orders, while a macroeconomic slowdown and geopolitical tensions further compounded the demand uncertainty. The Red Sea crisis also disrupted shipping routes, making it harder for Indian exporters to meet delivery timelines.\nCompetition from countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam, which benefit from lower labor costs and preferential trade agreements with key markets, also intensified. However, geopolitical tensions in Bangladesh, especially in the second half of FY2024, created opportunities for India to expand its capacity and capture a larger share of global orders.\nGeopolitical Shifts and the Bangladesh Factor\nBangladesh, which remains one of India's chief competitors in the global apparel market, has benefited from its least developed country (LDC) status, providing it with preferential duty access to major markets like the US and the EU. This, combined with lower labor costs, has made it a formidable competitor to India. However, recent geopolitical tensions in Bangladesh have raised concerns over the country's ability to sustain its production capacity in the long term.\nWhile Bangladesh is expected to enjoy LDC privileges for another two years, recent tensions may result in international buyers diversifying their sourcing strategies, which could include placing more orders with Indian manufacturers. The availability of competitive labor costs and ongoing government support in India further enhance the country\u2019s appeal as a sourcing destination.\nGovernment Support and Policy Boosts\nIndia's long-term growth prospects in the apparel export sector are also supported by various government initiatives. The production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, introduced to boost domestic manufacturing and exports, is playing a crucial role in increasing the competitiveness of Indian apparel exports. The PLI scheme incentivizes manufacturers to expand their capacity and improve productivity, which is expected to lead to long-term benefits for the sector.\nIn addition to the PLI scheme, the government has launched the PM Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (MITRA) scheme, which aims to strengthen India's position in the global textile and apparel trade by providing scale benefits and fostering integration across the value chain. MITRA is expected to particularly enhance India\u2019s presence in the man-made fiber segment, which is gaining traction in international markets due to changing consumer preferences and environmental considerations.\nMoreover, ongoing negotiations for free trade agreements (FTAs) with the United Kingdom and the European Union could further enhance market access for Indian apparel exporters. These FTAs would reduce tariff barriers, making Indian products more competitive in these markets.\nKrishnamurthy from ICRA notes, \u201cApart from the benefits from the fresh capacity additions under the PLI scheme, the PM MITRA scheme is expected to strengthen India\u2019s presence in the global apparel trade by providing scale benefits and strengthening the country\u2019s presence in the man-made fiber value chain.\u201d\nFinancial Outlook and Capex Spending\nAs the sector looks toward growth in FY2025, ICRA expects capital expenditure (capex) spending to increase, reflecting the industry\u2019s confidence in the future. Capex spending is expected to remain in the range of 5-8 percent of turnover in FY2025 and FY2026, with companies focusing on capacity expansion and modernization.\nHowever, despite the expected revenue growth, challenges remain in terms of cost pressures. Labor costs, freight charges, and other operational expenses are on the rise, which could impact profit margins. ICRA estimates that the industry\u2019s operating margins may contract by 30-50 basis points in FY2025, despite softer raw material prices.\nThe interest coverage ratios of ICRA\u2019s sample set of companies are projected to moderate marginally, declining from 5.8 times in FY2023 to 5.0-5.5 times in FY2025 and FY2026. This is primarily due to large debt-funded expansions as companies ramp up capacity to meet rising demand. Meanwhile, the total debt/operating profit before depreciation, interest, taxes, and amortization (OPBDITA) ratio is expected to be in the range of 2.0-2.4 times in FY2025 and FY2026.\nEvolving Consumer Trends and Long-Term Prospects\nIndian apparel exporters are also set to benefit from evolving consumer trends in key international markets. There has been a growing preference for sustainable and ethically produced apparel, a trend that aligns well with India\u2019s traditional strengths in organic cotton and eco-friendly production methods. Indian manufacturers are increasingly tapping into this trend by offering sustainable product lines, which are gaining traction in global markets.\nMoreover, Indian exporters have been quick to adapt to changes in fashion cycles, particularly the growing demand for fast fashion. By integrating technology and data analytics into their operations, Indian apparel exporters can better predict consumer demand and streamline their production processes, thereby reducing lead times and improving delivery schedules.\nThe government\u2019s focus on boosting the man-made fiber segment also positions India well to cater to the growing demand for versatile, durable, and eco-friendly fabrics.\n  apparel industryExportersretail sector\nNext Story\nRetail & Business\nBest Diwali Gifting Ideas for a Radiant Festive Glow\nBY - Saptopriya Ghosal\nJunior Writer\nOct 23, 2024 / 12 MIN READ\nFollow Us\n  There is no better occasion than the festival of Diwali for exchanging gifts that symbolise happiness, good health, and beauty.

Trade relationships are playing a pivotal role in shaping industries. The International Housewares Association (IHA) has been a cornerstone in fostering connections between buyers and sellers since its inception in 1938. At the forefront of this initiative is Derek Miller, the President of IHA, who emphasizes the importance of international collaboration, particularly between India and the United States.\nCentral to IHA's mission is the annual Inspired Home Show, held in Chicago every March. This event brings together exhibitors and retail buyers from over 125 countries, showcasing the latest innovations in housewares. Miller elaborates, \u201cThe Inspired Home Show serves as a global stage for showcasing products and establishing vital business connections.\u201d This platform not only highlights American brands but also opens the door for Indian manufacturers and retailers to gain visibility in the US market.\nAs Miller notes, \u201cIndia is represented both on the exhibitor and attendee sides at our shows,\u201d which signals a growing interest in Indian products among US consumers and businesses. This burgeoning relationship is significant, especially considering the competitive landscape of the global houseware industry.\nEvolving Trade Dynamics\nThe dynamics of trade have shifted dramatically in recent years, influenced by political and economic factors. Miller highlights how US tariffs, especially during the Trump administration, forced many manufacturers to reconsider their sourcing strategies. He states, \u201cThe tariffs prompted our members to look for alternative countries for sourcing and production, and India emerged as a strong candidate due to its robust manufacturing capabilities.\u201d\nAnand Baldawa, the CEO of thinKitchen, echoes this sentiment, emphasizing the vast potential of the Indian market. He shares, \u201cThe Indian houseware industry represents a $3 billion market opportunity, projected to grow to $6 billion.\u201d This exponential growth reflects not just the demand for housewares but also the increasing consumption patterns driven by a growing middle class and government initiatives aimed at boosting domestic consumption.\nOpportunities for Collaboration\nWith India positioning itself as a viable manufacturing hub, the collaboration between Indian retailers and US manufacturers is not just beneficial; it is essential. Baldawa suggests that the Indian government\u2019s push for a $5 trillion economy is contingent on boosting domestic consumption, which naturally translates into greater demand for houseware products. \u201cAs consumption increases, the need for quality production in consumer products will skyrocket,\u201d he affirms.\nBaldawa\u2019s company, thinKitchen, primarily targets the mid to premium segment of the market, aligning perfectly with the evolving consumer behavior in India. He explains, \u201cWe focus on the mid to premium segment, catering to consumers who prioritize value over just low prices.\u201d This shift in consumer behavior is indicative of a larger trend: Indian consumers are increasingly willing to invest in higher-quality products that offer better design and functionality.\nThe Role of Design and Quality\nMiller and Baldawa agree that the pillars of successful products in the houseware industry are design, quality, and price. \u201cIf you combine these elements, you have a recipe for success,\u201d Miller states confidently. He emphasizes that Indian manufacturers have significantly improved in these areas over the years. \u201cThe quality and design of products coming out of India have seen remarkable enhancements,\u201d he says, underscoring the potential for Indian products to resonate with US consumers.\nBaldawa adds another dimension to this discussion, noting that India\u2019s strength lies not only in its manufacturing capabilities but also in its cultural diversity, which can drive innovative designs. \u201cWe can leverage our rich heritage and modern design trends to create unique products that stand out in the global market,\u201d he suggests.\nCapitalizing on Competitive Advantages\nOne of India\u2019s competitive advantages in the global houseware market is its English-speaking population, which facilitates smoother communication with international partners. Baldawa points out, \u201cThe convenience of English proficiency helps us connect with global customers and build relationships more effectively.\u201d This linguistic edge, combined with the ongoing improvements in infrastructure and government initiatives, positions India favorably on the global stage.\nThe Indian government has introduced various performance-linked incentive schemes and export benefits aimed at bolstering manufacturing. Baldawa explains, \u201cThese incentives, along with organized trade delegations, help Indian manufacturers get in front of the right audiences, making it easier to forge partnerships with US brands.\u201d This holistic approach to enhancing trade relationships sets the stage for increased collaboration between Indian and US businesses.\nUnderstanding Consumer Preferences\nAs the global houseware market continues to evolve, understanding consumer preferences becomes paramount. Miller identifies several key trends that Indian brands should be aware of to remain competitive. \u201cHome entertaining has gained tremendous importance since the pandemic, and this trend shows no signs of slowing down,\u201d he explains. With consumers looking to create memorable experiences at home, there\u2019s a rising demand for stylish and functional houseware products.\nAdditionally, color trends are vital, as Miller highlights IHA\u2019s partnership with the Pantone Color Institute. \u201cColor is incredibly important at the point of purchase, and staying attuned to these trends can make a significant difference for brands.\u201d By aligning their offerings with these trends, Indian manufacturers can better meet the demands of consumers in the US market.\nThe Impact of Lifestyle Changes\nBaldawa adds that lifestyle changes, particularly post-pandemic, have led to a more discerning consumer base. \u201cToday\u2019s consumers are not just looking for cheap products; they seek value and convenience,\u201d he states. As people become busier, products that simplify cooking and cleaning processes are gaining traction.\nTo tap into this trend, Indian manufacturers must focus on innovation that enhances consumer convenience. Baldawa notes, \u201cWhether it\u2019s through smart designs or multifunctional products, finding ways to make life easier for consumers will be key to success.\u201d\nThe Path Forward\nAs the global houseware market becomes increasingly competitive, the collaboration between Indian retailers and US manufacturers presents a promising path forward. With a strong emphasis on design, quality, and understanding consumer preferences, Indian brands are well-positioned to make a significant impact in the international market.\nMiller concludes, \u201cIHA is committed to facilitating these connections and helping brands navigate the complexities of global trade.\u201d By continuing to foster relationships and sharing valuable insights, the IHA and industry leaders like Baldawa are paving the way for a thriving future in the houseware industry.\nIn this new era of globalization, the potential for mutual growth between India and the US in the houseware sector is immense. As both markets continue to evolve, the opportunity for innovation and collaboration will be the driving forces behind success.\n  retail Indiaindia retailHome and KitchenGlobal trends\nNext Story\nRetail & Business\nTop 7 Winter Wear Brands in India Under 3500 for Men and Women\nBY - Ria Duneja\nMT Editorial\nOct 21, 2024 / 17 MIN READ\nFollow Us\n  Winter clothing is not just about keeping cozy, it is, in fact, an amalgamation of comfort, style, and durability to be able to confront the chilling weather conditions boldly.

While traditional eCommerce continues to expand, especially during the festive season, Q-commerce has revolutionized how consumers access products, delivering goods in as little as 10 minutes. This innovation is not just a convenience for customers but a strategic game-changer for retailers, particularly in a highly competitive and fast-evolving market.\nPlatforms like Zepto, bigbasket, and Blinkit are leading the charge in this retail evolution, and recent data from Shiprocket underscores the growing importance of Q-commerce, projecting the Indian festive eCommerce market to hit $12 billion during October to December 2024\u2014a 23 percent increase from $9.7 billion in 2023. Q-commerce is expected to contribute a significant $1 billion to this total, showing its role as a crucial driver of festive season sales.\nWhat is Driving the Q-Commerce Boom?\nQ-commerce is growing at an unprecedented pace, fueled by several factors: consumer demand for faster deliveries, technological advancements, and an increase in urbanization. With more people moving to cities and adopting digital shopping habits, the need for speed in service delivery has never been more crucial.\nWhile eCommerce was initially associated with waiting days or even weeks for orders, Q-commerce offers near-instant gratification. It ensures that consumers get essential goods and premium products like electronics, beauty items, and fashion accessories in just minutes after placing an order. This convenience is especially appreciated in key cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Chennai, where time is of the essence.\nAccording to Shiprocket\u2019s insights, the rise of digital penetration in Tier II and III cities has further expanded Q-commerce\u2019s reach. Over 60 percent of online festive orders are expected to come from these non-metro regions in 2024, fueled by better internet access, rising disposable incomes, and increasing digital literacy. As Q-commerce platforms scale their operations, they are effectively bridging the gap between consumer demand and product availability, delivering not just groceries but premium products too.\nThe Role of AI and Social Media in Q-Commerce Growth\nA key factor in the expansion of Q-commerce has been the influence of AI-driven recommendations and social media, especially in categories like fashion and beauty. According to Shiprocket\u2019s data, 84 percent of consumers make purchases based on AI-powered suggestions or influencer promotions. This trend has a strong foothold during the festive season, where social media-driven shopping becomes even more prominent.\nAdditionally, the insights reveal that around 55 percent of festive orders are placed by first-time shoppers, demonstrating the growing appeal of eCommerce to new audiences, especially in smaller cities and towns. As these first-time shoppers become accustomed to the speed and convenience of Q-commerce, it is expected that they will continue using these platforms even beyond the festive season.\nSpeed Meets Premium Tech\nZepto, a platform synonymous with ultra-fast delivery, has pushed the boundaries of what is possible in Q-commerce. Its latest move? Offering 10-minute delivery of the highly coveted iPhone 16 across major Indian cities. Consumers in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Chennai can now order the iPhone 16 and have it in their hands within minutes.\nVinay Dhanani, President of Zepto, highlighted the company's achievement, \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to partner in bringing the latest iPhone 16 to our platform. With Zepto, we\u2019re offering more than just speed\u2014this is about delivering premium tech right to your door in minutes, providing an unmatched shopping experience in cities like Chennai and Hyderabad where we may just be the first to do this.\u201d\nThis development is a testament to how Q-commerce is evolving beyond everyday essentials like groceries and household items to include high-end products like electronics. As consumers become accustomed to such rapid service, the expectation for quick delivery of premium items will likely become the new norm in urban India.\nSetting New Records in Q-Commerce\nNot to be outdone, bigbasket, a Tata Enterprise, has also embraced the quick commerce revolution. Recently, the platform delivered an iPhone 16 to a customer in Bengaluru in a record 7 minutes. The order, placed at 8:00 AM, was delivered by 8:07 AM\u2014underscoring bigbasket\u2019s commitment to not just groceries, but also premium electronics.\nHari Menon, Co-Founder and CEO of bigbasket, shared this milestone on LinkedIn, saying, \u201c372 iPhones zapped by happy customers in just 100 minutes! Watch the real-time magic of our first iPhone 16 delivery this morning. And no need to panic, folks\u2014our drivers aren\u2019t speeding! Our perfectly placed dark stores do the heavy lifting. Safety first, speed second.\u201d\nThis achievement highlights bigbasket\u2019s innovation and efficiency in the on-demand delivery space, further supported by its partnership with Croma, one of India\u2019s leading electronics retailers. Through this partnership, bigbasket has been able to ensure swift and reliable delivery of high-value products, extending its capabilities well beyond groceries and daily essentials.\nBlinkit\u2019s Partnership with Apple Reseller\nBlinkit, another pioneer in the Q-commerce space, has joined forces with Unicorn Infosolutions, a leading Apple reseller, to deliver the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus across several Indian cities, including Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Pune, and Bengaluru. This partnership enables customers to receive the latest Apple devices within minutes, giving Blinkit an edge in the fiercely competitive Q-commerce market.\nAlbinder Dhindsa, Founder and CEO of Blinkit, highlighted the success of this collaboration, \u201cWe are partnering with Unicorn Infosolutions (the largest Apple Premium Partner in India) for the third year in a row to make the latest iPhone available. Customers in Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Pune, and Lucknow can get an iPhone 16 delivered within minutes.\u201d\nBlinkit\u2019s focus on premium product delivery, coupled with its experience from previous collaborations, underscores how Q-commerce is not just about speed but also about delivering high-end, sought-after products. In addition to swift deliveries, Blinkit and Unicorn are offering discounts of up to Rs 5,000 on select credit cards, making it an attractive proposition for tech enthusiasts eager to get their hands on the latest iPhone.\nThe Shift to Premium Products in Q-Commerce\nWhile Q-commerce initially gained traction for delivering groceries and daily essentials, the market has expanded rapidly to include premium and high-tech products. The iPhone 16 deliveries by Zepto, bigbasket, and Blinkit represent a significant shift in consumer behavior. With more customers willing to pay a premium for convenience, Q-commerce is no longer just about fast grocery runs\u2014it\u2019s about meeting the demands of modern consumers who want speed and quality in all categories.\nThis trend indicates a broader transformation in the retail sector, with quick commerce platforms increasingly looking beyond basic goods to cater to consumers who expect both efficiency and access to luxury products. The success of these platforms in delivering the iPhone 16 during the festive season is a clear indication of how this shift is reshaping the industry.\nGrowing Export Opportunities for MSMEs During the Festive Season\nIn addition to the growth of domestic Q-commerce, Indian MSMEs are also tapping into global markets during the festive season. According to Shiprocket, India\u2019s eCommerce export market, currently valued at $3-4 billion, is projected to surge to $200-300 billion by 2030. Cross-border sales grew by 15-20 percent in 2023, driven by a global appetite for Indian goods like handicrafts, home d\u00e9cor, and fashion.\nShiprocket currently facilitates $100 million in global eCommerce GMV, with over 3,000 merchants actively engaged in exports. The festive season presents a massive opportunity for these merchants, with platforms like Amazon Global and Flipkart\u2019s Global Stores allowing MSMEs to expand their global reach.\nAs Saahil Goel, MD & CEO of Shiprocket, pointed out, \u201cWith the rise of quick commerce and the increasing global appetite for Indian products, we are excited to support MSMEs in tapping into this tremendous $12 billion opportunity. Our goal is to continue innovating and providing the tools necessary for businesses to scale and succeed both locally and internationally.\u201d\nThe Role of Infrastructure in Q-Commerce Success\nThe success of Q-commerce, particularly for premium products, hinges on the efficiency of the underlying infrastructure. Dark stores, which are strategically located warehouses designed to serve as delivery hubs, play a critical role in ensuring that products can be delivered in such short time frames.\nAs Hari Menon pointed out, bigbasket\u2019s dark stores are instrumental in making ultra-fast deliveries possible without compromising safety. These stores are set up in densely populated urban areas, ensuring that delivery personnel can quickly pick up orders and navigate through traffic to reach customers within minutes.\nSimilarly, Zepto and Blinkit have invested heavily in building and optimizing their infrastructure to support the rapid fulfillment of orders. As more platforms adopt this model, the race for the fastest and most reliable service will continue to intensify.\nThe Future of Q-Commerce in India\nThe festive season in India has always been a critical period for retailers, and with the rise of Q-commerce, the stakes are higher than ever. According to Shiprocket, quick commerce alone is expected to contribute $1 billion in GMV during the 2024 festive season, reflecting the growing demand for fast, reliable, and convenient shopping experiences.\nLooking ahead, the Q-commerce sector is expected to continue its rapid growth, driven by advancements in technology, consumer demand, and the ongoing expansion of infrastructure. As platforms like Zepto, bigbasket, and Blinkit push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible, the retail landscape in India will continue to evolve, offering consumers faster and more diverse shopping experiences than ever before.\nQ-Commerce as the Future of Indian Retail\nThe rise of quick commerce has fundamentally changed the way consumers shop in India. With platforms delivering everything from groceries to premium electronics like the iPhone 16 within minutes, the expectations for speed and convenience are now higher than ever. As companies like Zepto, bigbasket, and Blinkit continue to innovate and expand their offerings, the future of retail in India will increasingly revolve around the rapid fulfillment of both essential and luxury products.\nThe Q-commerce revolution is not just a temporary trend\u2014it is a lasting shift in consumer behavior, one that will continue to shape the future of retail for years to come.\n  ecommerceretail IndiaConsumer trends\nNext Story\nRetail & Business\nEmbracing Minimalism: How Millennials are Redefining Luxury in a Fast-Paced World\nBY - Guest author\nOct 20, 2024 / 10 MIN READ\nFollow Us\n  In a world characterized by relentless consumerism and rapid technological advancements, millennials are increasingly turning towards minimalism as a way to redefine luxury. This shift isn\u2019t just a fleeting trend; it represents a profound change in values and priorities that aligns with a more intentional and conscious way of living. As a millennial myself, I\u2019ve observed firsthand how this movement is reshaping our understanding of luxury and impacting various facets of modern life.\nThe Rise of Minimalism\nMinimalism, at its core, is about simplifying life by focusing on what truly matters. It involves decluttering physical spaces, reducing material possessions, and prioritizing experiences over things. For millennials, who grew up in an era of unprecedented consumerism and digital saturation, minimalism offers a counter-narrative to the cluttered and overstimulated world they inhabit.\nThe appeal of minimalism among millennials can be traced back to several key factors\n1. Environmental Consciousness: Millennials are acutely aware of the environmental impact of their consumption habits. With increasing concerns about climate change, waste management, and resource depletion, minimalism offers a way to reduce one\u2019s ecological footprint. By embracing a lifestyle that values quality over quantity, millennials are making more sustainable choices and supporting eco-friendly brands.\n2. Financial Prudence: The economic challenges faced by millennials, including student debt, high living costs, and uncertain job markets, have fostered a more frugal mindset. Minimalism allows for a more budget-conscious approach to living, where fewer, higher-quality purchases replace numerous, lower-quality ones. This shift not only helps in managing finances better but also in investing in long-term value rather than transient trends.\n3. Mental Clarity and Well-being: The fast-paced nature of modern life often leads to mental and emotional overload. Minimalism provides a remedy by creating serene, organized spaces that promote mental clarity and reduce stress. For millennials, who are increasingly prioritizing mental health and well-being, the minimalist lifestyle offers a path to a more balanced and fulfilling life.\nRedefining Luxury\nTraditionally, luxury was associated with opulence, excess, and exclusivity. It was about owning high-end items and showcasing wealth through material possessions. However, as millennials embrace minimalism, luxury is being redefined in more nuanced and personal terms.\n1. Experiential Over Material: For millennials, luxury is less about owning expensive items and more about having meaningful experiences. This shift is evident in the growing popularity of travel, unique dining experiences, and immersive cultural activities. Millennials value experiences that enrich their lives and create lasting memories, often opting for well-curated, enriching experiences over flashy, temporary possessions.\n2. Craftsmanship and Quality: In the minimalist ethos, luxury is about appreciating well-made, timeless pieces that stand the test of time. Millennials are gravitating towards products that emphasize craftsmanship, durability, and authenticity. Whether it\u2019s a high-quality piece of clothing, a meticulously crafted piece of furniture, or artisanal food products, the focus is on value and longevity rather than fleeting trends.\n3. Personalization and Customization: The millennial approach to luxury includes a strong desire for personalization. Tailored experiences and customized products reflect individual tastes and preferences, offering a sense of exclusivity and personal connection. This trend is evident in the rise of bespoke fashion, personalized skincare routines, and custom home d\u00e9cor, all of which cater to the desire for unique and meaningful luxury.\n4. Ethical and Sustainable Luxury: Luxury for millennials increasingly involves ethical considerations. There is a growing demand for brands that operate transparently, engage in fair trade, and practice environmental stewardship. Millennials are willing to pay a premium for products that align with their values, supporting companies that contribute positively to society and the planet.\nThe Impact on Various Sectors\nThe minimalist movement is influencing multiple sectors beyond fashion and consumer goods:\n1. Retail and Consumer Goods: Retailers are responding to the demand for minimalism by curating more streamlined and purposeful product selections. Brands are focusing on offering high-quality, versatile products that appeal to the minimalist mindset. The rise of direct-to-consumer models also supports this trend by providing transparency and fostering a more personal connection between brands and consumers.\n2. Home Design and D\u00e9cor: The minimalist aesthetic is transforming interior design, with an emphasis on clean lines, functional spaces, and a decluttered approach. Home d\u00e9cor trends now prioritize simplicity, natural materials, and thoughtful design elements that create serene and harmonious living environments.\n3. Technology and Digital Spaces: Even in the digital realm, minimalism is making its mark. User interfaces are becoming more intuitive and uncluttered, focusing on enhancing user experience through simplicity. Apps and digital platforms are adopting minimalist designs that reduce visual noise and improve functionality.\n4. Travel and Leisure: The travel industry is witnessing a shift towards experiences that offer authenticity and connection. Millennials are seeking out destinations and activities that provide genuine cultural experiences and opportunities for personal growth, rather than just luxurious amenities.\n  In my own journey, embracing minimalism has transformed my perspective on what constitutes true luxury. It has led me to prioritize experiences over possessions, invest in quality rather than quantity, and seek out products and experiences that resonate with my values. The minimalist lifestyle has not only simplified my surroundings but also enriched my life in profound ways.\nAs millennials continue to drive the minimalism movement, it is clear that luxury is evolving to reflect a more thoughtful and intentional approach to living. The emphasis on quality, authenticity, and meaningful experiences is reshaping our understanding of what it means to live well. By embracing minimalism, millennials are not just redefining luxury; they are forging a path towards a more sustainable, fulfilling, and mindful way of life.\n  Authored By\nVikram Kankaria, Co-Founder & CEO, Fashor\n  luxuryMillennialsRetail Market\nNext Story\nRetail & Business\nThe Role of Social Media in Revolutionizing Ethnic Fashion Trends for Millennials\nBY - Guest author\nOct 20, 2024 / 11 MIN READ\nFollow Us\n  In the digital age, social media has become a driving force behind fashion trends, reshaping how fashion is created, consumed, and celebrated. For millennials, who are highly active on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest, social media is not just a tool for communication but a major influence on their fashion choices. This is particularly evident in the realm of ethnic fashion, where social media has played a pivotal role in revolutionizing trends and redefining traditional styles.\nThe Rise of Social Media as a Fashion Influencer\nSocial media platforms have democratized fashion, allowing anyone with an internet connection to influence and be influenced by fashion trends. For millennials, who are both creators and consumers of content, social media has become a powerful medium for discovering and sharing fashion inspirations. This is especially significant in the context of ethnic fashion, where traditional garments are being reimagined and modernized through online interactions.\nPlatforms like Instagram and TikTok have given rise to a new breed of fashion influencers and content creators who specialize in ethnic fashion. These influencers often showcase how traditional attire can be styled in innovative ways, blending classic elements with contemporary trends. By sharing their unique takes on ethnic wear, they inspire their followers to experiment with their own styles, thus driving the popularity of hybrid fashion trends.\nInfluencers and Content Creators: Shaping Trends\nInfluencers have become key players in the fashion industry, and their impact on ethnic fashion trends cannot be overstated. Many influencers focus on ethnic fashion, using their platforms to highlight how traditional garments can be adapted for modern wear. For instance, an influencer might showcase a traditional saree styled with a contemporary crop top or demonstrate how a classic kurta can be paired with trendy accessories for a more casual look.\nThese influencers often collaborate with brands to promote new collections and styling ideas. Through sponsored posts, giveaways, and collaborations, they help brands reach a broader audience and generate buzz around their products. Their endorsements can significantly boost a brand\u2019s visibility and credibility, leading to increased consumer interest and engagement.\nUser-Generated Content and Fashion Trends\nOne of the most exciting aspects of social media is the rise of user-generated content. Millennials are not just passive consumers; they actively create and share their own fashion content. This has led to a surge in DIY fashion tutorials, styling tips, and creative reinterpretations of traditional attire.\nPlatforms like Instagram and TikTok are filled with videos of users experimenting with ethnic wear, creating their own styling hacks, and showcasing their personalized takes on traditional garments. This user-generated content contributes to the rapid dissemination of new trends and styles, allowing fashion ideas to spread quickly and organically.\nFor example, a user might share a video of how they\u2019ve transformed an old saree into a trendy dress or demonstrate how traditional embroidery can be incorporated into modern outfits. Such content not only provides inspiration but also encourages others to embrace and innovate upon traditional styles.\nThe Impact of Visual Culture\nSocial media\u2019s emphasis on visual content has had a profound impact on how ethnic fashion is perceived and consumed. Platforms like Instagram and Pinterest are visually driven, meaning that fashion trends are often spread through striking images and aesthetically pleasing posts. This visual culture has led to the rise of \u201cfashionable\u201d ethnic wear, where traditional garments are styled to look modern and chic.\nMillennials are drawn to visually compelling content that showcases ethnic fashion in new and exciting ways. This has led to a growing interest in hybrid styles that blend traditional and contemporary elements. For instance, traditional lehengas and sarees are being styled with modern accessories, such as statement jewelry and contemporary handbags, creating a look that is both elegant and trendy.\nThe Role of E-Commerce and Online Shopping\nSocial media has also revolutionized the way ethnic fashion is sold and purchased. Many fashion brands and designers use social media platforms to showcase their collections and drive traffic to their e-commerce sites. Instagram\u2019s shopping features, for example, allow users to buy products directly from posts, making it easier for millennials to purchase the latest ethnic fashion trends.\nOnline shopping has become increasingly popular, especially among millennials who value convenience and variety. Social media platforms provide a window into the latest collections and trends, allowing users to explore and shop for ethnic fashion from the comfort of their homes. This integration of social media and e-commerce has created a seamless shopping experience, where fashion trends can be discovered, shared, and purchased all in one place.\nThe Influence of Cultural Exchange\nSocial media has facilitated a global exchange of fashion ideas, leading to a fusion of styles and influences. For millennials, this cultural exchange has broadened their understanding and appreciation of ethnic fashion from different regions. Traditional garments from various cultures are being embraced and reinterpreted in new and creative ways.\nFor example, the fusion of Indian ethnic wear with Western fashion elements has become increasingly popular. Social media platforms have played a crucial role in showcasing these hybrid styles, allowing users to see how traditional garments can be styled with modern pieces. This cultural exchange not only enriches the fashion landscape but also encourages a greater appreciation for diverse ethnic traditions.\nChallenges and Opportunities\nWhile social media has revolutionized ethnic fashion trends, it also presents challenges. The rapid pace of trend cycles can lead to fast fashion practices, which may impact the sustainability of ethnic fashion. Additionally, the overwhelming amount of content can sometimes make it difficult for users to distinguish between authentic and superficial trends.\nHowever, social media also presents opportunities for brands and designers to connect with their audience in meaningful ways. By leveraging social media\u2019s power to engage and inspire, brands can create campaigns that resonate with millennials and promote a more thoughtful approach to fashion.\nSocial media has undoubtedly played a transformative role in revolutionizing ethnic fashion trends for millennials. By facilitating the sharing of fashion inspirations, driving trends through influencers and user-generated content, and integrating with e-commerce, social media has reshaped how traditional attire is perceived and styled. As millennials continue to embrace and innovate upon ethnic fashion, social media will remain a key driver of trends and a platform for celebrating the dynamic fusion of tradition and modernity.\n  Authored By\nVikram Kankaria, Co-Founder & CEO, Fashor\n  Social mediaEthnic WearMillennials\nNext Story\nRetail & Business\nThe Future of Phygital Retail: Trends to Watch in the Coming Years\nBY - Guest author\nOct 20, 2024 / 13 MIN READ\nFollow Us\n  In today\u2019s rapidly evolving retail landscape, the boundaries between online and offline shopping are becoming increasingly blurred. Enter the era of \"phygital\" retail, a term that captures the fusion of physical and digital experiences. This hybrid approach is transforming how brands engage with customers by integrating the convenience of digital tools into the tactile world of brick-and-mortar stores. The result is a more personalized, dynamic shopping experience that meets the demands of modern consumers. The pandemic further accelerated this shift, with research showing that 84% of consumers now expect seamless integration between online and in-store experiences, driving brands to enhance their phygital presence.\nWhy Phygital Retail is Here to Stay\nThe rise of phygital retail is driven by a simple fact: consumers no longer view online and offline shopping as distinct experiences. Instead, they expect seamless transitions between the two. Whether discovering new products online, visiting a store for a hands-on experience, or completing a purchase via an app, customers today want flexibility, speed, and convenience.\nAccording to research, nearly 80% of consumers prefer physical stores when they need a product immediately. At the same time, according to research by IMB, two-thirds of consumers discover new items online before ever stepping foot inside a store, while nearly three-quarters of retail customers still prefer to shop at a physical location rather than online. This duality has pushed brands to redefine shopping, creating experiences catering to immediate gratification and digital discovery.\nThe Phygital Advantage: What It Means for Businesses\nAt its core, the phygital strategy allows businesses to connect with customers wherever they are, enhancing convenience without sacrificing the in-person experience. This is especially vital in industries where the tactile nature of a product is essential, such as fashion or travel accessories. However, even these in-store interactions are no longer limited to the physical realm. Digital tools, such as interactive kiosks and augmented reality (AR), are increasingly being incorporated into stores to enhance customer engagement and bridge the gap between browsing and buying.\nBlending the Physical and Digital Worlds\nPhygital Retail acknowledges that physical stores remain a significant part of the customer journey but are no longer the entire experience. A customer\u2019s interaction with a brand now spans multiple touchpoints\u2014from social media to in-store kiosks, digital marketing campaigns to mobile apps. By merging these touchpoints, brands can deliver a cohesive experience, ensuring consistency in how they are perceived, whether online or in-store.\nThis holistic approach enables retailers to create stronger, lasting connections with customers by recognizing their diverse needs and preferences. For example, younger consumers might favor digital interactions, while older shoppers prefer in-store visits. The phygital model accommodates both, offering options that cater to all demographics.\nTransforming In-Store Experiences\nIn the age of digital integration, the traditional retail store is no longer just a place to buy products. Instead, it becomes an experiential hub, offering unique and interactive ways for customers to engage with the brand. Digital shelf displays, virtual assistants, and self-checkout kiosks are other examples of how brands can elevate the in-store experience by incorporating technology. These features improve operational efficiency and allow customers to take control of their shopping experience, fostering a sense of autonomy and satisfaction.\nBridging In-Store Exploration with Online Convenience\nFor many consumers, especially those shopping for high-value or personal-use items like luggage or travel accessories, the ability to touch and feel products is essential. Yet, the convenience of online shopping remains unbeatable. Brands that implement phygital strategies can offer the best of both worlds \u2014 customers can explore products in-store, then make their final purchase online, often with customized recommendations based on their in-store experience.\nThis seamless transition between physical and digital realms ensures that brands meet evolving customer expectations, especially in industries where practical evaluation and ease of purchase are equally important.\nPhygital Solutions Shaping the Future of Retail\nAs retailers look to the future, they are embracing a range of innovative phygital solutions designed to meet the changing expectations of consumers. These solutions improve the customer experience, boost efficiency, and enhance brand loyalty.\nSmart Fitting Rooms: Equipped with touchscreens and RFID technology, these rooms allow customers to receive personalized recommendations and styling advice based on their preferences and purchase history. Integrating digital tools into the fitting room experience creates a tailored shopping journey that feels intuitive and engaging.\nSelf-Checkout Kiosks: Speed and convenience are paramount for today\u2019s shoppers, and self-checkout kiosks enable customers to scan, bag, and pay for items without waiting in line. This contactless approach particularly appeals to tech-savvy consumers and helps retailers reduce labor costs.\nInteractive Product Displays: By combining the physical act of browsing with digital content, interactive displays allow customers to access in-depth product information, reviews, and comparisons right from the store aisle. This enhances decision-making and drives sales by providing real-time, relevant insights.\nDigital Shelf Edge Displays: These advanced displays use e-ink and LED technology to present product information, pricing, and promotions. They offer a dynamic alternative to traditional price tags, ensuring accuracy and capturing customer attention.\nLeverage AR and VR for Enhanced Experiences: Augmented and virtual reality tools can bring products to life, allowing customers to visualize how items look or function in their environment. This technology benefits retailers looking to bridge the gap between online and in-store shopping.\nMobile-First Approach: In-store mobile apps are becoming a must-have. Integrating features like store navigation, exclusive offers, and mobile payment options ensures a smoother shopping experience.\nExperiential Retail: Physical stores should focus on experiences that cannot be replicated online. Hosting in-store product demonstrations or workshops provides customers with hands-on knowledge while increasing brand engagement.\nStrategies for Success in Phygital Retail\nBrands that want to thrive in the phygital era must implement strategies that prioritize the customer experience across all touchpoints. Here are a few key approaches:\nOffer Multiple Fulfillment Options: Customers today expect flexibility in how they receive their purchases. Whether through in-store pickup, curbside service, or home delivery, brands should provide various options to meet diverse preferences. The \"Buy Online, Pick Up in Store\" (BOPIS) model is particularly effective in driving online and in-store traffic.\nCreate Personalization at Scale: Harnessing data from both digital and physical interactions allows brands to deliver personalized recommendations, enhancing the shopping journey. Offering tailored experiences based on customer behavior helps foster loyalty and differentiate a brand in a crowded marketplace.\nEnable Omnichannel Loyalty Programs: Rewarding customers for engaging with a brand across multiple platforms \u2014 whether through purchases, social media interactions, or in-store visits \u2014 builds a deeper connection and encourages repeat business. Omnichannel loyalty programs are crucial to maintaining engagement and nurturing long-term relationships.\nChatbots and Virtual Assistants: Whether online or in-store, AI-powered assistants can guide customers through their shopping journey.\nThe Path Forward\nAs the retail industry continues to evolve, phygital strategies will play a crucial role in shaping the future of shopping. Brands that embrace this hybrid approach blending the best of physical and digital worlds, will be well-positioned to meet the changing needs of their customers. By delivering a seamless, personalized, and engaging experience, retailers can attract a wider audience and build lasting brand loyalty in the years to come.\n  Authored By: \nNaina Parekh, Founder, EUME\n  phygitalretail futurephysical retailDigital retail\nNext Story\nRetail & Business\nTop 6 Brands Like Zudio for Trendy & Budget-Friendly Clothing\nBY - Saptopriya Ghosal\nJunior Writer\nOct 17, 2024 / 15 MIN READ\nFollow Us\n  Zudio has gained popularity for stylish and trendy clothes along with being easy on the pockets for fashion enthusiasts.

The festive season isn\u2019t just about sales; it\u2019s a celebration of culture, family, and personal expression. This year, leading fashion brands have focused on creating collections and customer experiences that align with this sentiment, blending opulence with accessibility, and tradition with contemporary trends.\nEthnic wear brands are gearing up to capture the spirit of celebration with exciting collections and innovative strategies. From enhancing online platforms to integrating omnichannel experiences, brands are redefining how consumers engage with their products.\nDesign Inspired by Tradition and Trends\nAcross the board, designers are delving into their heritage while incorporating modern twists, creating collections that appeal to the contemporary Indian shopper. Many brands have embraced the ethos that the festive season is an opportunity for individuals to shine, not just in their personal celebrations but through the outfits they choose.\nWhether it's Lakshita\u2019s Bollywood-inspired \"Sitarey\" collection or Saundh\u2019s expansion into bespoke bridal wear and day-to-night separates, the focus is on offering diverse, versatile options. \"Every woman is the star of her own story,\" said Sachin Kharbanda, MD and Co-Founder of Lakshita. \"From design to customer engagement, we\u2019ve meticulously planned every detail to create an extraordinary festive experience.\"\nSaundh, on the other hand, is debuting two new verticals\u2014Rozana, a versatile collection of mix-and-match separates, and Khaas, its bespoke bridal line. \"We\u2019ve consciously moved away from discount-driven promotions and focused on elevating the shopping experience,\" stated Sarabjeet Saluja, Founder of Saundh, who aims to redefine bridal and festive wear.\nKALKI Fashion has also infused creativity into its new collections, experimenting with fusion styles such as men\u2019s kurta sets with cowl drapes and ruffled, pre-pleated sarees, designed to blend modern aesthetics with traditional charm. \"Our team is experimenting with various designs, embroideries, and innovative silhouettes to redefine traditional styles,\" asserted Nishit Gupta, Co-Founder and Director of KALKI Fashion.\nAt Libas, the emphasis is on blending tradition with the needs of the modern Indian woman. \"We\u2019re launching our Festive Winter Collection, which captures the spirit of celebrations from grand events to intimate gatherings,\" added Sidhant Keshwani, Founder and CEO of Libas. Libas, with its brand ambassador Kiara Advani, has built collections that speak to younger audiences while maintaining deep roots in Indian heritage. With technology playing a key role, the brand is using AI-driven insights to tailor its offerings based on regional and market-specific preferences.\nElevating Customer Experience\nWhile the designs are crucial, brands understand that customer experience is equally essential in building lasting connections, especially during the festive season.

This system will provide customers with an endless aisle, minimizing lost sales and ensuring that they can access the best options, whether shopping online or in-store.\nSarabjeet Saluja highlighted the importance of bridging online and offline sales through social media.

Whether it\u2019s the resurgence of flip phones taking the market by storm or the craze for SUVs, where every automaker is fighting for consumer attention, trends have a way of captivating an audience. And just like those consumer trends, e-commerce vendors are always on the lookout for the next big opportunity. This is where omnichannel retail steps in. Omnichannel isn\u2019t just a buzzword anymore\u2014it's a revolution in how businesses engage with consumers. Whether shopping in-store, browsing on mobile, or placing an order via a voice assistant, today\u2019s consumer demands a seamless experience across all platforms. Retailers in India are increasingly catching onto this shift, and the numbers back it up. Currently, omnichannel retail accounts for about 13 percent of sales in India, roughly $11.2 billion. But this is just the beginning. By 2027, this figure is expected to quintuple, reaching a staggering $55 billion.\nIt\u2019s not just sales that are evolving\u2014consumer behavior is, too. Omnichannel retailing, powered by technologies like AI, machine learning, and AR/VR, is revolutionizing customer experiences, making them more personalized and engaging. Retailers who embrace this shift are not just keeping pace but are shaping the future of shopping.\nThe evolution of omnichannel customer experience\nWhat began as a push for convenience has now transformed into a race to deliver personalized interactions, real-time responsiveness, and a unified brand experience across every touchpoint. It's no longer enough for businesses to be present on multiple platforms\u2014they need to create seamless experiences across online, mobile, and physical stores that feel integrated and personalized for each customer. A key driver of this shift is hyperpersonalization, which has become the cornerstone of modern retail strategies. Thanks to advances in AI-driven technologies and data analytics, businesses are now able to predict customer preferences with uncanny accuracy. This has led to a tripling of hyperpersonalized interactions across various communication channels in just the past year. Consumers today expect every touchpoint to feel tailor-made for them, whether they're browsing products online or receiving a marketing email.\nSimultaneously, the surge in mobile usage is reshaping how retailers approach omnichannel strategies. With mobile devices now accounting for over 60 percent of all web traffic globally, a mobile-first approach has become essential. Companies are optimizing their websites and apps to ensure that users on smartphones and tablets experience the same smooth, intuitive interface as they would on a desktop. A clunky mobile experience can now be a dealbreaker, making mobile-first design a critical pillar of omnichannel success.\nMeanwhile, the rise of generative AI chatbots is revolutionizing customer service. Unlike traditional chatbots that rely on rule-based responses, generative AI bots can understand context, process natural language, and provide responses that feel genuinely human. This technology is already making waves, with 80 percent of consumers reporting positive experiences when interacting with these advanced chatbots. As businesses increasingly integrate generative AI into their communication channels, this evolution is expected to boost profitability by an average of 38 percent by 2035.\nProfitability with insights makes for a powerful factor\nOmnichannel retailing is also a powerful tool for boosting profitability. With the ability to connect customer interactions across multiple channels, businesses are opening the door to increased cross-sell and upsell opportunities. Studies reveal that 70 percent of consumers are more likely to spend more with companies that offer seamless, conversational experiences across their touchpoints. This creates a unique advantage for businesses: they can provide intelligent product recommendations that feel natural and timely.\nBut profitability doesn\u2019t stop at upselling. The true strength of omnichannel experiences lies in the wealth of customer insights businesses can collect. Every interaction across different platforms offers a treasure trove of real-time data. When used effectively, this data gives brands a deeper understanding of their audience, enabling them to refine their strategies and deliver even more personalized service. According to recent reports, 59 percent of consumers expect businesses to leverage the data they collect to create tailored experiences. When companies meet these expectations, they don\u2019t just close one sale, they build long-term relationships that foster brand loyalty and customer retention.\nThird-party logistics have become first-class solutions for omnichannel\nIn a world where consumer demand is constantly evolving, third-party logistics companies in India are crafting the blueprint for businesses to thrive in the omnichannel space. By offering an agile, scalable approach, 3PL providers are turning the intricate web of omnichannel retail into a streamlined operation. They aren\u2019t just handling shipments or warehousing; they\u2019re delivering real-time data insights, enhancing inventory control, and ensuring that customer expectations are not only met but exceeded. Whether it's optimizing fulfillment for those last-mile deliveries or using sophisticated inventory management to avoid stockouts, 3PLs are playing a pivotal role in the future of retail. With the right logistics partner, businesses can turn their vision into reality, creating a truly omnipresent brand experience that resonates with today\u2019s demanding consumers\n  Authored By\nZaiba Sarang, Co-founder, iThink Logistics\n  omni channellogisticsthird party\nNext Story\nRetail & Business\nEcommerce Outsourcing India: Cynergy BPO \u2013 Elevating CX through Cutting-Edge Technology\nBY - Guest author\nOct 17, 2024 / 11 MIN READ\nFollow Us\n  The global ecommerce industry continues to grow at an unprecedented pace, and companies are facing mounting challenges to meet evolving customer expectations while maintaining operational efficiency.

According to a recent report by IMARC Group, the market size for organic foods in India reached an impressive $1,582.2 million in 2023. With a projected Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 21.19 percent, this market is expected to skyrocket to $8,918.5 million by 2032. This remarkable growth presents significant opportunities for businesses in the organic food sector, as well as challenges in terms of supply chain management, marketing, and consumer education.\nKey Drivers of Growth in the Organic Food Market\nThe increasing demand for organic food in India can be attributed to several factors, each contributing to the market's rapid expansion.\n1. Rising Health Consciousness\nAs consumers become more aware of the adverse health effects of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, they are shifting towards organic food options, which are perceived as safer and more nutritious. The pandemic further accelerated this trend, as people began to prioritize health and wellness more than ever before. Organic products, which are free from harmful chemicals and genetically modified organisms (GMOs), are seen as a healthier choice, leading to their growing popularity among health-conscious consumers.\n2. Environmental Sustainability\nIn addition to health concerns, environmental awareness is driving the shift towards organic foods. Organic farming practices emphasize sustainability by avoiding synthetic chemicals, promoting soil health, and reducing the carbon footprint. Consumers are increasingly drawn to products that align with their values of environmental responsibility, and this is reflected in their growing preference for organic goods.\n3. Government Support and Certification Initiatives\nThe Indian government has introduced several initiatives to promote organic farming and make certification more accessible for farmers. Programs like the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER) are helping to expand organic farming across the country. These initiatives are aimed at building a sustainable farming ecosystem that can support the rising demand for organic food products, while also improving farmers' livelihoods.\n4. Consumer Awareness Campaigns\nAs organic foods become more mainstream, brands and businesses have ramped up efforts to educate consumers about the benefits of organic living. Public awareness campaigns, marketing strategies emphasizing purity and health, and social media influencers advocating for organic lifestyles have played a crucial role in this growing movement.\nDigital Shift: The Role of E-Commerce and Local Search Engines\nThe surge in demand for organic food has also been reflected in digital behaviors, as consumers increasingly turn to online platforms to seek organic products. According to a recent study by Justdial, India\u2019s No.1 local search engine, there was a significant increase in searches for organic food manufacturers, retailers, farms, grocery stores, and product dealers between June and August 2024. Organic food searches across India increased by a remarkable 47 percent compared to the previous quarter, with metropolitan cities leading this growth.\n1. Metropolitan Cities Drive Organic Food Searches\nMumbai saw a staggering 90 percent rise in organic food searches, followed by Pune (65 percent), Delhi (55 percent), Hyderabad (54 percent), Bangalore (40 percent), Chennai (38 percent), and Ahmedabad (24 percent). This trend reflects the growing consumer interest in organic products in urban centers, where health awareness and disposable incomes are higher, enabling more people to make conscious food choices.\n2. Growth in Non-Metropolitan Cities\nInterestingly, non-metropolitan cities are also showing strong growth in organic food searches. There was a 45 percent overall increase in organic food searches in these regions. Bhopal, in particular, witnessed a dramatic 18-fold increase in searches compared to the previous quarter, signaling the penetration of organic food awareness beyond major urban areas. Coimbatore also saw a substantial rise in organic food searches, increasing by 62 percent.\n3. Surge in Organic Food Manufacturer and Retailer Searches\nThe study highlighted a notable rise in searches for organic food manufacturers, which saw a 79 percent overall increase, with Pune, Mumbai, Jaipur, and Delhi being the top cities. Retailers also experienced significant growth, with searches increasing by 68 percent overall. Bhopal registered an astounding 49-fold increase in searches for organic food retailers, while other major cities like Mumbai (152 percent), Hyderabad (106 percent), and Delhi (100 percent) followed suit.\nThe Growing Demand for Organic Farms, Grocery Stores, and Dealers\nThe increase in demand for organic products has also led to a rise in searches for organic farms, grocery stores, and product dealers. Organic farms witnessed a 31 percent overall rise in interest, with cities like Hyderabad, Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, and Pune leading the pack. Organic grocery stores saw a 25 percent increase in searches, with Hyderabad, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, and Delhi being the top cities for these queries. Organic product dealers saw a 13 percent increase in searches, with Chennai emerging as the leading city for these searches.\nOpportunities and Challenges for Businesses in the Organic Food Sector\n1. Expanding Product Offerings\nAs consumer demand for organic foods continues to grow, businesses in the food industry have a significant opportunity to expand their organic product lines. Diversification of offerings into categories like dairy, fruits and vegetables, grains, and processed organic foods can cater to the increasing consumer base seeking variety in organic options. Many businesses are also investing in organic certifications and improving traceability to ensure that their products meet the stringent standards set by organic certifications like the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP).\n2. Investment in Sustainable Farming Practices\nTo meet the growing demand for organic foods, businesses must invest in sustainable farming practices that ensure long-term productivity and environmental health. This includes adopting organic farming techniques, such as crop rotation, composting, and using natural pesticides. Collaborating with farmers and educating them on the benefits of organic farming can help businesses secure a reliable supply of organic produce, ensuring consistency in quality and availability.\n3. Consumer Education and Awareness\nWhile the demand for organic food is growing, many consumers are still unaware of the full range of benefits associated with organic products. This presents an opportunity for businesses to engage in consumer education initiatives, highlighting not only the health advantages but also the environmental benefits of choosing organic products. Brands can leverage social media, partnerships with influencers, and customer testimonials to build trust and educate consumers about the value of organic living.\n4. Navigating Supply Chain Challenges\nOne of the biggest challenges in the organic food sector is ensuring a reliable and efficient supply chain. Organic farming yields are often lower than conventional farming, and the process is more labor-intensive. As a result, businesses must develop robust supply chain strategies that ensure the consistent availability of organic products at scale. This may involve partnerships with organic farmers, investments in cold storage and transportation, and collaboration with retailers to manage inventory effectively.\nThe Future of Organic Food in India\nThe future of the organic food market in India looks promising. With a projected growth rate of over 21 percent annually, the market is poised to transform how Indians consume food, making organic products an integral part of everyday life. As more consumers embrace organic living and businesses expand their offerings, the industry will likely see innovation in product development, sustainability initiatives, and consumer engagement strategies.\nIn conclusion, the rapid rise of the organic food market in India is driven by a confluence of factors, including health awareness, environmental consciousness, government support, and digital trends. As this trend continues, businesses that invest in organic products, sustainable practices, and consumer education will be well-positioned to capitalize on the immense growth opportunities in this dynamic sector.\n  Organic Food MarketIndian retail market\nNext Story\nRetail & Business\nTop 8 Brands Like Lacoste in India: Style, Comfort, and Quality\nBY - Saptopriya Ghosal\nJunior Writer\nOct 16, 2024 / 22 MIN READ\nFollow Us\n  Lacoste is known for its classy, sporty, and comfortable fashion.

They will have reduced customer service calls and increased browsing on the retailer's website - offering more exposure to the products, and some customers may purchase more as a result. Data on carrier performance can complement negotiations. Tracking deliveries with exceptions gives reliable insight into data on carrier performance. Negotiating contracts and getting valid invoices Opportunities for savings exist when retailers partner with eCommerce shipping companies. These solutions allow retailers to recognize if any surcharges or other fees were incorrectly applied to their shipments. An audit system can automate the hard work of invoice matching. It will help you seamlessly identify discrepancies and allocate your account with ease and sophistication. Making data-driven decisions Without access to analyse real-time shipping data in a Business Intelligence platform, retailers are unable to comprehend how distance, delivery speed, package size, and density effects spending across their transportation carrier landscape. They can't see how (or where) improvements will (or should) take place, which puts them at a disadvantage when it comes to carrier talks. Understanding how changes in fulfillment affect zone and carrier service-level downgrade possibilities is crucial, for example, if a retailer is increasing ship-from-store or locating a new distribution center. Creativity and education are essential in any profession, but one needs to understand that there is a type of creativity that comes only through training. It can be tricky to figure out carrier reliability using only a simple evaluation of delivery success rates. The solution might be through simulating deliveries and using the results. Retailers can use this process to find bad carriers and realise which are good by looking at simulation success rates. eCommerce shipping companies have significant benefits, one of which is better rates for package delivery. It can automatically match the invoices with deliveries that go out and track which parcels have been delivered. With a multi-carrier network, businesses can control rates and manage how packages will be provided. What are the Costs Associated with eCommerce Shipping? 73% of shoppers expect pocket-friendly, express deliveries when they shop online. One way to decrease the cost of your shipping rates is to use a carrier that offers competitive pricing.  Here are the expenses associated with eCommerce shipping companies and some extra information to help you with your eCommerce shipping needs. Dimension of the Package  Shipping rates depend on the size of the package. eCommerce shipping solutions will determine the price based on the length, height, and width measurements. They use the dimensional weight to determine the cost of larger packages.  Weight of the Package The weight of the package is calculated by its dimensions. If this weight exceeds the dimensional weight, you will have to pay additional shipping costs. Intercontinental Shipping Options Shipping zone tracking is a way of measuring the distance between your package's origin and destination. The number ranges from 1 to 8, and in the continental US, they can vary from Zone 1 to Zone 8. Carriers calculate the logistics cost from where a package is shipped, but that zone may change depending on their location. Shipping and Handling When an order is placed and the seller dispatches the product, a carrier partner has to handle a lot of things and pay several types of fees. The shipping fee covers only the shipment of the item. Handling fees cover every step in getting it to its destination, including retrieving it on picking lists, moving inventory, packing shipments, and loading up trucks. 13 Factors to Keep in Mind When Choosing eCommerce Shipping Companies for Your Business Pricing There are several considerations when you choose top shipping companies in India for eCommerce business. You can go with free shipping and inherent costs, or you could look into a budget shipping option that fares much better. Can free shipping impact your business? Research your competitors' prices and shipping rates and the availability of insurance. You can buy insurance commissioned by you or one supplied by your postal carrier. And, be sure to verify that shipping prices are included in a plan before it's finalised for online sales. Speed  The experience is worth the wait. The Customer will buy again if they know their order is progressing and that it is being tracked with a status of \"In Process\" or \"Complete.\" Customers may need to wait an extra few days to place an international or customised order but say Amazon should be able to provide speedy service when delivering a same-day item. eCommerce shipping companies should have specialised personnel, large fleets, and vast networks of delivery personnel to ensure fast, reliable delivery. Ask your provider about potential fees beforehand to make sure you meet deadlines. SLA (Service Level Agreement) Both the price and delivery speed depend on your SLA. Consumers will generally order products from the company to receive their orders quickly. To reach this satisfaction, the company needs to deliver its order promptly and provide speedy delivery to customers. Your agreement may also include additional online shipping services required for the shipment. Service availability You should know when shipping companies for eCommerce operate, it could incur shipping delays. When providing delivery/ shipping dates to customers, specify the data in your SLA. Reliability People want to receive what they ordered. It would help if you worked with an eCommerce shipping solution-providing companies that guarantee the quality of your products and get shipments to your customers as quickly as possible, despite unforeseen events like severe weather or infrastructure challenges.  Reach One of the important pieces of information that a shipper needs to identify is the reach of their carriers. It describes the locations and areas where they operate and the states and country encompassing their fleet. Delivery must be able to serve specific sites that may be hyperlocal or rural, so make sure that the eCommerce shipping companies are competent. Previously, a significant concern was delivering products on time, but other logistical issues may be more critical. Courier partners provide various services to the industry, including COD coverage and special handling for sensitive items. These added services could also expedite your shipment. Accountability Business owners lose money when the delivery time for their products becomes too long. It is a must for an eCommerce owner to know their package's whereabouts to provide quick customer service. The shipping company's warehouse is often situated outside the city, making the customer experience even more stressful. A simple tracking solution helps both sides to get through these difficult situations. Many eCommerce packages show shipping information on their apps, including pick-up locations, current status, and estimated delivery times. Monthly Goals By working with carrier partners, the possibility goes high to develop goals for reducing RTO. If you want more shipments, the best shipping company will also help you with this. You can set up milestones such as the average shipment quota to meet over a week or quarter. Payment Cycle Payments for services should come within a time frame, like monthly payments. While signing a partnership agreement with a new company, you should specify your payment cycle. Paying ahead of time prevents you from being charged late fees on a credit card. Use a clear payment cycle to avoid unexpected charges after the end of the month. Cash on Delivery Adjustments COD reconciliation is a crucial step in the whole range of services, including handling the item and collecting signatures from customers when they receive their orders. When you send a COD shipment, it includes the remittance of payment for that order, plus closing any mismatched accounts in the company's books. Charges for COD orders are not accounted for until they are transferred from the carrier to your company. You may be unwittingly paying more than you should. Value-Added Services eCommerce shipping companies often provide value-added services such as ensuring that your packages are safe and in perfect condition upon arrival. DHL can offer you exceptional packaging for your business, such as customised packaging and temperature-controlled transit. DHL also provides a choice of vehicles and other services. Before you decide on your order, consider the additional services you may need for the shipment if you are shipping internationally or domestically. Penalties It is essential to specify penalties. Missing shipments or deliveries should come with strict consequences proportional to the amount. Monitor the accounts and impose fines if it is not fixed. To prevent fraud from occurring, you can purchase insurance from the carrier too. Visibility Transparency is crucial to successful eCommerce shipping companies. Without visibility, you won't be able to keep track of your orders and stay on pace with your latest sale. Online retailers need to have a robust delivery system to keep their customers comfortable and satisfied. Customers get anxious when they don't know where their orders are, and thus, the courier partner must be able to provide updates on the package. From the customer\u2019s point of view, you can improve your customers' delivery experience by choosing appropriate shipping methods. If you offer several shipping options, it is essential to choose the right ones. Limiting your options to the most reputable best-of-the-best shipping companies will reduce researching time. Before narrowing down your options, you should research each company's past track record to find the suitable option for your shipping needs.

The above is a simple definition. However, today's eCommerce shipping & delivery involves highly complex processes - ordering, picking and packing, labeling, shipping, tracking, communication, and returns - that work seamlessly to deliver the product at the right place, time, and price. What is eCommerce Shipping? eCommerce shipping is essentially the transportation of an ordered product from the warehouse or fulfillment center to the customer's location, where delivery personnel will handle the last-mile phase of the order fulfillment process to deliver it to the customer. Shipping for eCommerce is a critical function of online retail as it is a crucial differentiator in satisfying and retaining a customer.

A weak shipping process implementation could lead to late deliveries, high shipping costs, unfulfilled or misplaced orders, wrong items shipped, ambiguous return policies, and poor or damaged packaging, thus, impacting the business [contactus_lilgoodness] Suggested Read: What is Shipping Policy? What are the Processes Involved in eCommerce Shipping & Delivery? The shipping process in eCommerce involves receiving an order from the customer and all the ecommerce operations after that to successfully deliver it to the customer including confirming the order, locating the relevant products in the warehouse, packaging them, and having them picked up by the shipping company, that will eventually transport it to the same city or town as the customer, from where on-ground delivery partners will pick it up and provide the last-mile delivery to the customer's exact location. The eCommerce shipping process has three preliminary stages: Order Receiving This process begins with the customer placing an order and the seller confirming it. Once it has been confirmed, the products need to be located in the warehouse and confirmed that they are in stock, after which the next phases can commence. Order Processing Order processing involves scrutinizing every detail of the order such as making sure that the product is not damaged, checking the number of items or units ordered, checking the accuracy of the delivery address and which route and courier provider would be the fastest, which lays the groundwork for the product to eventually be picked up and transported by the relevant eCommerce shipping company. Order Fulfillment This involved the chosen eCommerce shipping company picking up the order after all the final checks and inspections are done to make sure that everything is accurate. Depending on where the customer is located and the proximity of the warehouse or fulfillment center to them, the journey will vary accordingly. Once the order reaches the final destination, it is unloaded and is picked up by the delivery partner, who will eventually handle delivering the order to the customers' doorstep. What are the Various Costs Associated with Shipping for eCommerce? Shipping for eCommerce and logistics costs are complex, and hence an overview of the various expenses associated with eCommerce shipping is given below: Shipping Costs Shipping costs are calculated by considering the following: Dimensions (lxbxh) \u2013 volumetric and gross weight All shipping carriers assess both volumetric and gross weight for calculating shipping costs. The higher weight of the two is considered, and the rates are calculated accordingly. The gross weight is the package's actual weight, and the volumetric weight considers the size (l x b x h) of the box to determine the shipping cost. The distance to the door The distance between a package's origin and destination is considered when calculating shipping costs. Thus, the distance between two different points of origin, and shipping to the same destination, may significantly differ. And so, the longer the shipping distance, the higher the shipping cost. Shipping rates structures Generally, most eCommerce businesses use the following two shipping rate options: Flat rate shipping  As the name suggests flat rate shipping is the rate charged is uniform for all orders within a particular range, like weight range (volumetric or gross), order value, delivery distance, or some other categorization. The disadvantage of this rate structure is that a few orders will be overpriced and others underpriced. Real-time rates With this option, the website displays the actual shipping rates offered by the carrier per the weight of the package, the type of service, and the shopper's location.  This rate structure charges the correct amount to ship the package to the shopper's location.  Free Shipping Most eCommerce businesses increase their sales conversions by offering free shipping. For most consumers shopping online, free shipping is one of the main reasons for completing a purchase on a particular site, thus building customer loyalty. eCommerce businesses can offer free shipping without losing money, as follows: Incorporating shipping costs into product costing.Offering free shipping for a minimum purchase value.Providing a loyalty program and charging a fee in place of free shipping on all orders. Suggested Read: What are other ways to reduce shipping costs? Handling Costs Handling fees cover everything other than shipping costs. It includes staffing costs for picking and packing items, labeling, loading/unloading the vehicle, and other fulfillment services. Packaging Packaging affects shipping costs and customer experience, affecting the brand image. The delivery person and the packaging represent a brand that the customer personally interacts with first-hand. A well-executed packaging is a vital feature that fosters brand loyalty and customer retention. Conversely, poor or easily damaged packaging leads to a disappointed customer.   The Right Packaging There are plenty of packaging options from which one may choose. For example, consider the following to help determine the right packaging option: The type of product.The shape of the product.Weight (volumetric or gross) of the product.Is the product over-dimensional?Fragility or durability of the product.Does the manufacturer supply the product with packaging?Whether to go for plain packaging or brand the packaging. Custom Packaging Though custom packaging will be expensive, top-quality packaging can help one's brand stand out in a competitive environment. Good packaging can create a memorable experience, go viral, and build brand loyalty. Sustainable Packaging With rising eCommerce sales, the waste generated increases. Further, the widespread awareness of the current global environment scenario means that choosing sustainable shipping for eCommerce and packaging solutions will help improve one's brand image, leading to increased sales. Shipping Carrier Used Outsourcing shipping services to a 3PL can help eCommerce businesses expand operationally and negotiate better shipping discounts - lowering overall costs and increasing profits. A sizeable 3PL network of fulfillment centers can also help eCommerce stores with lower shipping costs and transit times. Surcharges Extra costs added to a base rate are surcharges. Any charge exclusive of the regular shipping and handling rates affects the shipping price. Here are a few surcharges: Fuel surcharge: it covers the fluctuating price of oil. It\u2019s a percentage of the shipping cost and changes once a week.Over dimension surcharge: means an oversized or bulky non-standard package, which is non-stackable or fragile. Such packages get charged more.Surcharges for remote territories: are additional fees carriers charge for delivering packages to remote areas, like beyond city limits or the service area covered by the carrier.Dangerous/Hazardous goods: pose a possible risk to other packages carried with it and a delivery person or people near it. Hence such packages incur surcharges.  Returns eCommerce returns have now grown into a massive issue. The Paypers\u2019 2021-2022 Report says shoppers return anywhere from 10% to 40% of their eCommerce purchases.  For businesses, returns create challenges in terms of higher logistical costs, increased handling costs, and risk fraud. Also, if the customer returns the product in a damaged condition, the business bears the costs involved in either product refurbishing or disposal. The returns process can be daunting, inconvenient, and frustratingly slow for shoppers. 10 Best Practices in eCommerce Shipping for Competitive Advantage in 2024 Adopting the best practices for eCommerce shipping is vital for achieving success as this is the differentiator that helps one stand out amongst a host of competitors.  It is also proven that nearly 50 to 60% of online shoppers don't buy from eCommerce stores offering high shipping costs.  Hence, the strategies listed down below should be followed: Form a Team Source \"You are only as strong as your team.\" \u2014 Dominique Wilkins. So go ahead and form a team. It is vital that the business generates leads, attracts shoppers to your site, increases conversions, and handles customers' concerns on shipping efficiently, effectively, and courteously. Accordingly, the following teams will be required sooner or later to grow a successful business: The Marketing Team: designs flyers and promotions to attract visitors to the site. The marketing team also carries out communications of such promotions to customers. Communication could be by emails, sms', blogs, vlogs, social media, and online advertisements. The Web Designers and Developers Team: ensure the site is attractive and easy to navigate for potential customers. Like the product listings and offers, the content is explicit and without ambiguity. Customers must also be able to notice the various shipping options and policies available, preferably before checking out. The Fulfillment Team: ensures that the orders received are processed quickly. The correct items per the order are picked, packed, shipped accurately, and on time. The Customer Service Team: is one of the most critical. A missed or delayed delivery is most aggravating for a customer. They must know how each phase in the product lifecycle affects the customer and how to respond to customer concerns satisfactorily. Concerns could be about a particular ongoing promotion, shipping options or policies, and myriad other issues. Set the Right Goals Source It is essential to set a goal for yourself. You must know where you wish to go and how to get there. One must review one's path from time to time and then make a course correction if required considering where one wishes to be. Then decide on a strategy that would best help one achieve the desired goal. Set SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-based) business goals for yourself. Then decide on a strategy. The goals must be clear and concise, which will ensure a profitable shipping strategy with an efficient shipping process and operations.  Here are a few questions that one needs to answer to set goals and strategy: What is your target market? Do you wish to acquire international customers or stay domestic? Do you want to brand yourself, or is it simply a side-hustle? Do you want to generate more business and earn profits? How would you do it?How can one increase conversions? By offering free shipping or various shipping options or offering competitive price rates, one can increase conversions.How can you increase the average order value? Maybe by offering free shipping for minimum order quantity/value or a flat shipping rate to high-value or multiple products bundled together.How can you expand the market or increase the target audience? You may do that by partnering with a large 3PL having an extensive network of fulfillment centres. Thus, being able to ship order to new geographies or by introducing newer, fast-moving products.How to decrease costs \u2013 by exploring possibilities of tying up with major carriers or 3PL, try cheaper packaging options or alternate suppliers offering to ship the product to the customer directly. Furthermore, by showing more affordable products than existing suppliers, increasing efficiency by streamlining the eCommerce operations through process reviews, and thorough education of fulfillment teams, one can decrease costs. Right Return Policy Source The reverse logistics process in eCommerce entails collecting a purchased product from a customer and putting the returned item in stock if undamaged. This process is a cost concern for an eCommerce business and, if mismanaged, will affect its profitability. Generally, a customer happy with a business's return policy will shop with the same retailer again. The reverse is also true: shoppers unhappy with the returns process will, in all likelihood, never shop with that business again. Hence, have a customer-friendly return policy and process returns quickly.  Right Shipping Strategy Source Here are the following shipping strategies that one may use per one requirement. Several eCommerce businesses have successfully used many of the below-mentioned shipping aggregation methods as a strategy: Real-Time Rates Source Display rates in real-time directly from major carriers. Though this strategy will get you the best rates, it cannot be used as a promotional tool because there could be marked variation in rates.  Benefits: Cheapest shipping option.You can offer to ship to new geographies at lower costs for expanding your business since you can take advantage of scale. Same-Day Delivery Source Same-day delivery requires a highly efficient fulfillment with equally efficient logistics operations. The disadvantage involves deploying plenty of resources, making the entire process costly.  Benefits: The fastest delivery time will be the USP (unique selling point) to increase conversions. With increased conversions, one's reputation and brand image increase, leading to higher revenues.On the flip side, one should not adopt same-day delivery as the first go-to strategy. Instead, a two-day or overnight shipping would be a more uncomplicated strategy to implement initially.Once a robust team handles the fulfillment efficiently and a capable, trustworthy shipping partner is signed up, you could then think of offering same-day delivery service to your customers. Free Shipping Source Most customers shopping online expect to be offered free shipping.  Benefits: It fulfills the customer's expectations.It directly improves conversion rates, which builds customer loyalty and retention, thus leading to higher profits. Though free shipping is free for the customer, ensure that higher product margins cover this cost, else you will lose money on every sale. Flat Rate or Standard Shipping Source One way to avoid offering free shipping is to provide a flat rate or standard shipping to the customer.  A flat rate charged for shipping any product ignores the type or size of the product or order value.  Table rate shipping offers a low flat rate for shipping a product close to the fulfillment center, which progressively increases with the distance from the fulfillment center to the destination. Depending on the minimum order value or order quantity, one could also charge a flat rate.

Everyone needs assistance sometimes, especially in the strenuous and hyper-competitive environment known as the eCommerce industry. While eCommerce has taken the world by storm, a phenomenon especially prevalent in developing countries like India, eCommerce sellers have had to fend off competition from both small, local firms and gigantic MNCs alike. As more people use eCommerce to browse and purchase items they need, more people are also trying to capitalize on setting up new businesses or expanding the online presence of their existing ones. This has given rise to multiple new technologies and innovations that have changed the way we are able to use eCommerce, for the better. For instance, just a few short years ago, no one would complain if they received their orders in a week. However, in the current day and age, people have grown accustomed to getting their orders in a day and even a few hours due to the advent of ultra-fast and hyper-local delivery services. This may seem daunting if you are a budding eCommerce seller but fear not. This is where you can ask for help from 3PL logistics companies that provide dedicated fulfillment services for online sellers. In this blog, we will provide answers to what a 3PL logistics service provider is, why you should partner with one, and the 10 best options currently available in the market. What are 3PL Logistics Companies? 3PL logistics companies are firms that provide a vast swathe of eCommerce services, primarily relating to tasks such as order fulfillment, inventory management, order processing, picking and packing fulfillment service, eCommerce shipping, and last-mile delivery service. They are a good alternative to self-fulfillment or 1st-party fulfillment services, such as Amazon FBA, because they provide increased flexibility, cheaper pricing, and value-added services, such as WMS software, branded tracking page, eCommerce customizable packaging, and more. Keep in mind that the range of services may vary depending on the company but the core focus is centred around successfully delivering orders to customers safely and on time. Once you have partnered with a 3PL logistics service provider, all you need to do is receive and monitor your orders and let them do the rest. These companies provide respite from most eCommerce logistics and eCommerce fulfillment-related tasks, allowing you to focus on the main aspects of your business, such as product development and marketing. [contactus_lilgoodness] Top 5 Reasons/ Benefits to Partner With a 3PL Logistics Service Provider in India Source Reduces Expenses Since 3PL fulfillment companies take care of almost every logistics and fulfillment requirement you may have and you only pay them a specific, pre-determined amount, the result is that you end up saving a ton of money compared to if you did it yourself. Most 3PL companies have partnerships with many other companies for various tasks, such as shipping and eCommerce warehousing, and can take advantage of bulk discounts that would not be available to a single seller. This enables you to increase your profit margins on every order, saving you a significant amount of money in the long run. Offloads Important Logistics Processes When you partner with a 3PL logistics service provider, you aren\u2019t just saving on money but on time and effort as well. Since most logistics tasks, such as transporting goods to wherever they need to be, storing products in a fulfillment center, selecting the appropriate product, packaging it and getting it ready for dispatch, shipping it to the customer's destination, and more, will be offloaded to your logistics partner, the entire post-sale process becomes more simplified and clear-cut. You only need to focus on promoting and selling as many products as you can while your 3PL provider does the rest.  Gives You Access to Advanced Technology and Features Many 3PL logistics companies come readily equipped with the latest technologies and features. Some of them include WMS software, fleets of different delivery vehicles, automated inventory management, order consolidation across platforms, and much more.

Provides Multiple Marketplace Integrations Investing in and operating a standalone WMS with no assistance can be tedious in addition to being expensive. However, most 3PL companies have their own WMS that can integrate with multiple selling platforms, website builders and shipping companies. This will allow you to store all your vital order and inventory-related data in one dashboard that can be accessed from anywhere. Additionally, you will be able to access historical data to be able to compare metrics from the current sales season to a previous one of your choosing.

What are the Features Offered by Top eCommerce Logistics Companies? As is typical in all industries and ecosystems, the top logistics companies for ecommerce that compete for the best clients and command significant market shares have several key characteristics in common. That is to be expected because these companies have become forces in their respective industries by adopting the best practices, and this is what you must check to see.  Given below are four top features that the top best logistics companies in India offer: Tracking facilities The logistics and distribution industry and the vast and complex supply-chain networks they operate have numerous moving parts. The top logistics firms maintain real-time, and 100% visibility across all elements of their operations and are sure to track every movement. Modern-day logistics companies for eCommerce use the latest technologies, tracking systems, and inventory trackers to maintain a holistic and detailed view of their current orders and ongoing deliveries received from various channels. Thus, you have real-time information about your inventory levels and order statuses (completed, delayed, returned and to be fulfilled, etc.)  Modern technology The top eCommerce logistics companies are fully equipped with the latest technology by the natural extension of the point above. Their systems are driven by tools like data analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and cloud software. All these technologies and systems are geared toward reducing the dependence on manual labour and automating cumbersome and time-intensive functions across the entire supply chain network.  The good thing is that since all players within this ecosystem (at least the top ones) have adopted modern technology that is adaptable and inter-connected across various stages of the supply-chain network, the entire ecosystem functions at an incredibly high level of efficiency. Users like you can monitor it all from a centralised location.  Route-optimisation for improved efficiency Leading eCommerce logistics companies are constantly striving to improve their processes, improve the reliability of their deliveries, reduce costs, and minimise delivery times (etc.). Therefore, they rely heavily on delivery management software for route optimisation. By identifying the \u201cbest route\u201d to transport goods from the storage location to the delivery address, they can achieve a cost-effective, efficient, and reliable service. Bear in mind that the \u201cbest route\u201d is not the shortest, cheapest, or fastest \u2013 but the one that balances out all the numerous elements to come up with the best one. This goes a long way toward improving customer loyalty, a key indicator of a sustainable, prosperous business. Top-notch customer support Satisfied and happy customers are the lifeline of any business. Here too, logistics companies for eCommerce make sure that they treat this as a final metric and operate omnichannel customer support systems. This is especially important today since customer demands have evolved. In the modern hyper-connected era, they want to be kept in the loop at all times and track their parcels across all stages of their journey in real-time (etc.) 10 Important Factors to Consider While Choosing an eCommerce Logistics Company Choosing the correct logistic company for eCommerce is important and must not be made in a hurry. Thorough due diligence is needed since several elements have to be considered when assessing your logistics partner. These range from industry-related points to those that are specific at the company level. Let\u2019s look at the top 10 points to consider while making your decision:  Cost of shipping This is a very important metric. As mentioned above, just like the \u201cbest route\u201d considers all elements, the shipping cost determines the overall package of your shipper. A low price does not mean your overall shipping cost will be low. Therefore, you must look for the correct balance between price and services.  For example, hidden costs such as additional fees for cash orders, add-on services charged separately, or discrepancies in goods tonnage, can result in a much higher overall shipping cost for you even though the rate-card price offered may appear low.  Therefore, make a thorough analysis of what service you need and your cost and profit structure, and then assess which eCommerce logistics companies fit your requirements. The number of pin codes reached While a greater number of pin codes your logistics partner serves is always a good thing, you must start with your requirements. If you expect the bulk of your orders to come from a limited number of pin codes, you do not require this. You must first ensure that your logistics partner covers \u2013 with efficiency \u2013 the areas that you need to service. For example, your customers may live mostly in tier I & II towns versus metros. Therefore, select eCommerce logistics companies accordingly. Real-time visibility Everything in today\u2019s world is now tracked in real-time. Everything is on-demand and instant. Today\u2019s customer is unsatisfied with the good old \u201cyour order is out for delivery\u201d \u2013 he needs to track his parcel movement in real-time and receive regular updates about its progress. This has become a critical component of creating customer satisfaction, and eCommerce logistics companies must have the power to provide it. For example, GPS-equipped delivery management software helps them to maintain this visibility. Service-level-agreements (SLAs) Given the vast array of services performed by logistics companies for eCommerce, this is a long list. Naturally, these can be core services (e.g. cash delivery, next-day delivery) or other special delivery services, including customised packing, hyper-local, specific time-window based (etc.) Each service has its price tag, terms and conditions of delivery, and rates. Negotiating a package price could work well for you in reducing your shipping costs. But for that, you first need to have a good handle on your requirements such as volume of orders, weight, value, fragility (etc.) Speed Customers, especially eCommerce customers, have rapidly evolved. Fuelled by the super-quick delivery times offered by eCommerce behemoths like Amazon, the consumers now expect this as a standard. Not only that, but they also want options, customisation, and real-time updates. However, speed of delivery \u2013 as maintained by your competitors- is something your eCommerce logistics companies must provide. If you cannot keep up, customers will go to your competitors. You should be able to eliminate some options based on delivery speeds and their associated shipping rates. Return-order management Unfortunately, an unavoidable aspect of an online business is the order returns. And while it will never go away completely, the trick is to reduce the number to its bare minimum so that it does not burn a hole in your operational expenses or create unhappy customers. Some eCommerce logistics companies pitch order-return management as part of their core strengths and are experts at managing it \u2013 from picking the parcel up to redelivery or refunding. They also efficiently handle other related issues, such as delayed shipments or failed ones.  This becomes especially important if you are a large eCommerce firm or are experiencing rapid growth. Infrastructure Using modern-day infrastructures like temperature-controlled delivery trucks or specialised packaging that is hardy and moisture-proof results in fewer goods being damaged while in transit.  Choosing a logistics company for eCommerce that offers such facilities may cost more than regular services but depending on the type of products you sell, the distance, and the type of roads they have to be transported over (etc.), this may be a good idea. You will see that your overall cost of operations will be lowered since the cost of breakage, pilferage, and damage during transit will come down significantly. A good track record on this front also helps in reducing your insurance premium, thereby further reducing your costs. Last-Mile Delivery software As mentioned earlier, route optimisation is a cornerstone in the logistics business. If an eCommerce logistics company can optimise the delivery routes by balancing out several elements such as number of deliveries on a route, bunching together similar deliveries of weight, destination, time etc., it results in a much lower cost of operation, including significantly reduced fuel consumption, which is one of the costliest line-items for logistics companies.  Thus, not only is your customer happy due to speedy delivery, but you can also offer them competitive shipping rates. Delivery security You may want to offer your customers security and peace of mind with insured and secured deliveries. This has grown to become particularly useful for eCommerce firms and their customers.  For example, specialised services like white-glove delivery, a service typically used for special cargo like heavy and bulky (e.g. large furniture sets), fragile, or high-value goods (e.g. expensive large-screen TVs), take very strict precautions while delivering these specialised goods. Customers are happy to pay a premium to ensure their goods are delivered safely, and you make a larger profit while offering your customers a choice of delivery options. It is a win-win for everyone concerned. Past performance While looking for best logistics providers, a starting point in your research should be its past performance scorecard.  At the end of the day, it is the performance that matters. A logistics firm may have several important features required for good, solid performance, but it is not of much use if it cannot harness all of them and put them together. For example, they may have poor leadership. Or suffer from labor turnover. Or from union-related problems.  Speak to their clients, both current and former, their vendors, suppliers, and value-chain partners. Check online reviews and eCommerce customer forums. You will immediately get a sense of whether they can walk the talk. Since the leading logistics firms have been around for a while, you should not have any problem getting the information you seek.

Hence, they act as a bridge for the flow of goods or other materials, ensuring that demand is met with supply and reducing the difficulty in working around a fluctuating supply and demand problem.

Warehouses have been changed from a storage space to a process that facilitates the efficient distribution of products between production and consumption. Warehouses exist in three different types: public, private, and bonded. Read along to find the list of top 3PL warehousing companies in India to decide which company will best suit your needs in 2024. What are 3PL Warehousing Companies? A 3PL warehousing company is responsible for all your warehousing services from storing products and goods purchased from a manufacturer, looking after those items at a facility, and then delivering them to another location for final fulfillment. For example, many eCommerce businesses buy products in bulk from their suppliers, who ship them to their warehouses to be stored. Online businesses partner with eCommerce fulfillment companies that have eCommerce warehouses where they store, pick and pack products and ship them to end customers efficiently. [contactus_gynoveda] Why are Third-Party Warehousing Services Companies Important for Efficient Warehousing Services? Warehouses have been around for years. Today, they offer more than just storing items \u2013 may also provide services to optimize the supply chain and reduce necessary costs. Read on to find out the answers to the importance of using such services. If you need a warehouse company that can monitor and track your storage needs effectively, you should contact them now before you need their services. Goods only need to be released when they are required. Better Inventory Management 8% of small businesses do not track their inventory, and of those who do, 24% don't have any stock. Late orders and delayed processing mean frustrated customers and wasted time. Warehouse companies provide you with a centralized, convenient location to store your goods. With a warehouse, you will be able to track and manage inventory more efficiently and ship and distribute products. In case a product is out of stock, you will know right away and can provide your customers with alternative options in the meantime. More Efficient Packing and Processing Most 3PL warehouse facilities provide you with all the equipment and supplies you need to store, ship, and process shipments from customers. Pallet racks, loading docks, and packing materials are just a few examples of products you can employ to save time and money. 3PL warehouses maximize flexibility by eliminating the need to arrange pickup or hire more employees for fulfillment. They can pack goods and classify them according to their legality and customer needs. It means that businesses have to write less code because the warehouse will do most of it and save money on logistics. Superior Customer Service 88% of online customers will pay more for faster delivery speeds. Over 63% of consumers expect to know an estimated or guaranteed delivery time. Better yet, they are willing to pay more for this service. A business's reputation can be quickly tarnished, which will hurt its revenue over time. If you fail to deliver orders on time, your company will suffer. With warehousing companies, you can return products more quickly and optimize distribution. They reduce errors and the chance of damage to goods while preventing your products from being lost or stolen in the order fulfillment process. Price Stabilization To maintain a continuous line of products, you can store your materials for a later release. A warehouse allows this by creating a demand-resource system where resources are available when needed. For example, if you own a sports equipment manufacturing and distribution company, you can store ski accessories in your warehouse so that when winter is over, they are still available. It ensures consistent stock levels to maximize your profits. Improved Risk Management Warehouses can store perishable items and may have refrigeration, depending on the type of storage you need. Warehouses offering cold storage for products keep your products at the right temperature and prevent them from spoiling or changing in colour or texture. They also help extend the products\u2019 shelf life and ensure customer satisfaction. Additionally, your inventory will be insured, so you will have a better chance of being compensated if they're damaged.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Partnering with 3PL Warehouse Companies in 2024 When deciding whether or not to outsource your company's warehouse operations, you must consider several factors \u2013 you may be looking for a way to expand, but company growth is heavily contingent on your space.  New opportunities imply significant changes in storage needs. While not as environmentally friendly as other options, warehouses can efficiently and economically handle these needs with unique, expansive models such as CrossDocks WMS. Consider warehousing as an option for your business and whether there are any drawbacks before making your decision. Advantages of Partnering with 3PL Warehousing Companies Warehousing services can significantly enhance your company. Under the right circumstances, you will benefit from warehousing your products, and overseas vendors will ship at as-needed intervals to reduce overstock and inventory.  Significantly Lower Investments Contract warehousing is a great option for a wholesaler, manufacturer, importer, or other small business that needs to store products, as its costs less money and time than regular warehouses. Warehousing using contracts lets small companies invest in obtaining and storing goods for a specific time, rather than investing in large warehouses to store items. Warehousing services providers keep your inventory, allowing you to have less space and money invested. Safety, Security, and Insurance If you wish to guard your wares, leave them under contract warehousing and keep a watch for any breaches. Typically, you do not have to worry about safety when renting a warehouse, as a renter \u2013 usually the owner \u2013 handles security and rent collection. The products are insured, covered by a guarantee, and are closely monitored with video surveillance. Location and Distribution The location of a good contract warehouse can significantly impact the company's success and profitability because of availability. While warehouses are expensive and time-consuming, contracting with them allows you to store your inventory in multiple locations, giving you easy access to your stock no matter where you are. Flexibility and Scalability Ease of scalability is a benefit to using 3PL warehousing companies \u2013 you can use as much or as little space as possible. Since different companies need different amounts of storage at different times, this saves time and money. The benefits of renting space in a warehouse are scalable and offer many other pricing options. Unlike having your own warehouse which needs considerable investment, here, you have the flexibility of renting rooms from different warehouses that often cater to various clients.  Access to Unlimited Distribution Centers and Technology-Enabled Solutions E-commerce distribution and delivery become easier through tech-enabled eCommerce warehousing services companies. You can use leveling software that connects to all of your online stores, providing instant fulfillment. You can also receive real-time inventory monitoring reports and automate the order process by tracking and reminding people when it\u2019s time to reorder. Inventory Tracking The distribution of your company\u2019s products is handled by warehousing companies. The most efficient way to get real-time data on products in transit is to streamline the tracking process by providing SKU information, batch numbers, or serial numbers. You can also get activity information about your inventory with comprehensive auditing. Disadvantages of Partnering with 3PL Warehouse Companies Though there are some potential negatives, the benefits of outsourcing warehousing typically outweigh them every time. Complex Reverse logistics There are a few factors that can impact the efficiency of reverse logistics with warehousing firms. Reverse logistics is the set of post-sales activities that are related to recapturing value and attempting to end a product's life cycle following sales. It's also called backflow, meaning an order goes from front to back. When a company is unable to sell its products, it must ship the product back to the manufacturer or distributor. However, the costs for shipping and selling are higher for companies with electronic commerce. When the number of returns spikes in a certain area, it slows down warehouse operations and can lead to higher customer dissatisfaction. It can also be problematic for retailers online who rely on 3PLs to handle such exchanges. Less Control The main disadvantage of using 3PL warehousing companies is that you give up some control over your supply chain and distribution networks. The third party takes this responsibility, communicating with customers and suppliers. This doubles the risks. 3PLs usually offer a partnership with a company, but this can be risky.

For example, Fulfillment by Amazon's incredible same-day and next-day deliveries has revolutionized the online retail model. Consumer expectations have risen dramatically and continue to do so. We now have hyperlocal delivery and 10-minute groceries \u2013 last mile delivery companies are constantly figuring out ways to deliver faster, better, and cheaper and planning new ways for the year 2024. What is Last Mile Delivery? As the name indicates, last mile delivery is the final leg of the journey of a product from the manufacturer to its final destination, i.e., the customer. This logistics cycle has three phases - the first mile, middle, and last mile. The last mile phase starts once parcels are picked up from the warehouse (or fulfillment center) of the final destination and is completed with the successful delivery to the customer. It is executed by last mile companies that pick up the parcel, load it onto a delivery vehicle, and transport it to the customer. The last mile delivery is the most challenging and costly part of an eCommerce shipping network. These last mile companies and their handy teams are forever battling tough weather conditions, road hazards, furious and demanding consumers, supply-chain holdups, and numerous other logistical costs and issues.  As you can imagine, all the above challenges operations for last mile delivery companies an extraordinarily complex and challenging task. And don\u2019t forget, this goes on day in, day out, across continents, time zones, tax regimes, governments, and market forces. Therefore, last mile delivery companies for eCommerce firms are a critical cog in the wheel and must be assigned the due importance. Without it, you won\u2019t achieve customer satisfaction \u2013 and no business ever survived without happy customers. [contactus_gynoveda] What Services do Last Mile Delivery Companies Offer? Last mile delivery companies offer a host of services and solutions that help eCommerce firms conduct their operations successfully. Let\u2019s look at some of their most popular services: Dynamic routing Route optimization significantly impacts the operations of last mile delivery companies. Efficient routing shortens delivery times, reduces logistics costs, and keeps eCommerce firms competitive by achieving customer satisfaction and happy clients.  By using the latest technology-led dynamic routing systems, last mile delivery startups can route and re-route on the go, thereby achieving a high level of efficiency. Automated dispatches By logical extension of the point above, using automated last mile delivery software enables last mile delivery startups to plan, analyze and monitor deliveries via a fully automatic system.  This optimizes resource utilization (e.g., fewer drivers, lesser idle times for vehicles), analyzes and solves inefficiencies, and reduces shipping cost. The result is a much more transparent and simplified process. Delivery visibility Modern GPS-enabled last mile software utilized by last mile delivery companies provides fleet managers with complete visibility of the end-to-end delivery process. This results in 100% transparency and equips fleet managers to monitor, course correct, handle emergencies, stay flexible, and exert control over the entire logistics operation. Electronic Proof of Delivery (ePoD) ePOD does away with the cumbersome and time-consuming processes of the old days when signatures, paperwork, lost receipts, forgotten documents (etc.) were an everyday struggle! ePOD enables last mile delivery companies to collect, store, analyze, and extract data and documentation when required. Audit tasks, data sharing, and transaction speeds are also greatly enhanced. Best practices benchmarking Modern tech-enabled logistics systems have greatly improved the insight available to fleet managers, including the planned vs. performance analysis by comparing critical KPIs. Fleet managers now have a holistic view from a centralized window across all operation elements, such as employee performance, customer rankings, the status of delivered or pending parcels, failed deliveries, delayed deliveries, fuel consumption, and 3PL performance. Deep data-analytical capabilities track these KPIs and maintain comprehensive reports to ensure top-notch performance. Flexibility Today\u2019s last mile delivery companies that service eCommerce retailers are nimble organizations while achieving and maintaining the benefits of scale. Their modern last mile delivery systems allow them to offer options such as self-service to customers.  This provides options for the customer, but it also reduces the burden on logistics, mitigates costs, and reduces the resources needed. Options like smart lockers at convenient locations are increasingly popular with eCommerce customers today. Crowdsourcing Customers want the convenience of doorstep delivery. However, with the burgeoning growth of eCommerce retail as a business model, it has become difficult for logistics companies to keep up. For example, the number of delivery people and vehicles required to service market demand could often become unsustainable. Therefore, last mile delivery companies in India have turned to crowdsourcing to fortify their operations. These new-age platforms help pair travelers with clients that need parcels delivered in the same localities.  Customer satisfaction Like any other business where customer satisfaction is the final metric for running a profitable and sustainable business, the same goes for eCommerce firms. In fact, in the uber-competitive world of online commerce, it assumes greater significance.  Therefore, customer satisfaction, customer journey, and experience are invaluable. Last mile delivery companies maintain omnichannel customer support, constantly collect customer feedback for incorporation into their operations, and benchmark against competitor actions and best practices \u2013 all of this is key for eCommerce firms and their last mile delivery startups, in achieving and maintaining happy customers.  Last mile delivery companies/ startups are constantly adding new services and tracking trends. Some include: Ever-faster deliveries: From same-day and 24-hour deliveries, we are now seeing the arrival of 10-minute groceries and 2-hr deliveries. Micro-fulfillment centers: Smaller satellite warehouses and micro fulfillment centers conveniently located across an elaborate geographical network provide more coverage, lower costs, and faster deliveries. Autonomous vehicles: Autonomous vehicles such as drones and driverless cars are increasingly being tested in logistics and transport. Food, medicines, and light electronic gadgets are some products delivered via these new-age vehicles. Suggested Read: List of Top 3PL 10 Warehousing Companies in India Challenges in Last-Mile Delivery That Can Impact Your Business The last-mile carriers generally work towards delivering the product from an intermediate shipping centre to the final destination. There are a lot of things that can go wrong in this phase that can impact your brand and the overall profits. Some of the major issues businesses can encounter in last-mile delivery include: Return of orders and the rising cost of logistics While order cancellations are common in e-commerce, one of the major reasons for the return of orders by customers can happen due to the mistakes occurring in the last-mile of delivery. Delayed deliveries, inability to track the packages properly, delivery of damaged goods, and misplacing orders- all of them can lead to higher returns. Most of these mishaps can happen due to the negligence of the 3PL partner or the lack of technological capabilities that can prevent these issues. Return of orders increases your logistics cost further. They also affect your market share and customer loyalty. According to a report by KPMG, up to 20% of the total e-commerce shipments are return orders. This shows the scale of the problem and how much costs can be saved by minimizing the same. Return to Origin (RTO)  This is another major issue that sellers face. It simply refers to sending back the order to the seller when it cannot be delivered to the customer. This can happen due to wrong addresses mentioned in the order or when the customer is not present/denies accepting the order, etc. Such incidents can lead to additional reshipping costs. Unable to address the rising demand in tier 2 and 3 cities With better internet connectivity, e-commerce demands have been rapidly rising in tier 2 and 3 cities of India. The last-mile delivery in this case presents its own unique challenges. The fulfillment center of your 3PL partner might be far from the delivery location. The interconnectivity between them can affect delivery speeds. Flipkart and Amazon are trying to solve this by partnering with local retail owners and creating pickup points from where customers can collect their orders. Remote locations are even more difficult to handle. Not meeting customer expectations Given the benchmarks that e-commerce giants like Amazon set, customers tend to expect the same elsewhere. They expect fast deliveries and may not care about the complications that can happen in the last mile. For example, harsh weather conditions, or a local lockdown can disrupt the delivery timelines. Customers also expect durability in their deliveries. They seek flexible timings and cheaper costs at their end like Amazon prime free delivery. Such a level of service is almost impossible without optimizing the supply chain in the last-mile. Things to Keep in Mind Before Partnering with a Last Mile Delivery Startup or Company Unless you have a good handle on your business requirements and, what you need from last mile delivery companies, you won\u2019t benefit from the collaboration. On the contrary, it could result in disaster.  Consider the points mentioned below as you research and select your last mile delivery startups: Your customer expectations Your competitors\u2019 delivery times and their last mile delivery startups/companies The impact of last mile delivery startups/companies on your shipping aggregators and delivery times Are last-mile delivery costs sustainable as a percentage of your overall operating cost? Will it prevent you from becoming profitable? The avenues of lowering last mile delivery costs while maintaining efficiency How to Choose a Last Mile Delivery Company that is Right for Your Business? Without dependable and efficient last mile delivery companies, an eCommerce retailer would be severely handicapped. However, with innumerable options available, the onus to make the correct selection is on you, i.e., identifying last mile delivery startups that best match your requirements. Include minute details like holiday lists, working days, shipping limitations, parcel weight restrictions, etc.  Given below are 10 leading factors you must consider:   Price Quite obviously, this is one of the essential starting points to consider. Last mile delivery companies operate out in the real world, battling the forces of nature, traffic, and several other dangers. Therefore, they charge their clients a fee, often a hefty one, for their value. You must look at your cost-to-benefit ratio, i.e., match their service fees against how important it is for your business.  Coverage Last mile delivery companies should cover the critical locations needed for your business operations, i.e., as many pin codes as possible. While you may not need to ship to every location in the country as a new eCommerce firm, it is important to check their coverage. You don\u2019t want to bottleneck your expansion if your company doesn't service those areas. Technology The operations of last mile delivery companies are a complex process with little or no margin for error. Additionally, they work under the severe pressure created by ever-changing dynamics like costs, angry customers, road dangers, weather, and fleet availability. The list is endless.  Modern delivery software that is utilized by last mile delivery startups/companies is vastly advanced and manages all the above variables to optimize your last mile operations. They do it with incredible speed and can handle vast scales. Ensure the companies that you are considering, use the latest technology to manage their operations. Order-returns Order returns, reverse logistics, inventory tracking, refunds, and rescheduling deliveries of incomplete or failed orders \u2013 all these instances are an unavoidable part of the eCommerce trade. However, if your last mile delivery startups have an efficient order-return management system, it would help to reduce the loss from such situations. Notably, during this process, the consumer tends to be annoyed or apprehensive, and managing it well would help create customer satisfaction.  Tracking orders This feature is a leading indicator of changing consumer demands. The old-school thought process of delivery in a week or 5 days are gone. Today\u2019s consumers want to be kept in the loop at every point of their parcel movement. Without real-time and live order-tracking features, you will not succeed as an eCommerce firm. Last mile delivery companies must offer a convenient order-tracking tool for your customers to track their orders. Delivery speed People often confuse the hyperlocal delivery model with last mile delivery. While both traverse the same routes while completing the final distance of their delivery, they aren\u2019t the same. As the name suggests, hyperlocal is a highly localized delivery model and typically offers much shorter delivery times, e.g. 10-minute groceries.  Last mile delivery, however, is the last leg of a much longer delivery route. Now, with modern technology and logistics capabilities, last mile delivery companies are also constantly working out on ways to keep reducing their delivery times and increase delivery speed. Customer support Customer satisfaction is the defining aspect of a successful or failed business model. Without happy customers, you won\u2019t have repeat orders or positive word-of-mouth exposure. Therefore, using a modern omnichannel customer setup for eCommerce firms is critical to their success. Payment With a plethora of payment options available these days - ranging from credit cards, digital wallets, UPI, and online transfers \u2013 today\u2019s consumers use options that suit their needs the most. From your end, however, if you don\u2019t make all of them available, you will see a high rate of cart abandonment and incomplete transactions.  Insurance Buying shipment insurance as a protective cover is an integral part of the supply chain movement. You must conduct research and shortlist last mile delivery companies that offer suitable options via insurance tie-ups for you and your type of cargo.  Customer feedback Check to see the comments of current and past customers of last mile delivery companies that you are considering partnering with. Online reviews, forums, and direct opinions are a good way of arriving at a decision. That would reveal a lot about their capabilities and performance.  10 Best Last Mile Delivery Companies/Startups for eCommerce in 2024 WareIQ Source WareIQ is a category-defining, best- in class full-stack eCommerce fulfillment tech platform (with inbuilt inventory planning, order fulfillment & shipping system) for modern brands to accelerate online sales/ expedite revenue growth & profits with same/next-day delivery.

[signup] Last Mile Delivery Companies FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)\nFebruary 07, 2023\nWhat is Kitting in eCommerce? Definition, Role, Benefits and Steps Involved in Managing Kitting in Warehouses in 2024\nIn the eCommerce, manufacturing and retail industries, millions of raw materials, products and shipments are distributed to and from various locations every day. The logistics involved in ensuring that all these items are shipped as cost-effectively and efficiently as possible is immense. It is in every business\u2019s best interest to identify ways to reduce their logistics costs and reduce shipping costs and this can usually be done by optimising the amount of space each parcel takes up. One fool-proof way of ensuring this happens is by implementing kitting. This enables multiple items to be shipped together in one large consignment, reducing the space it takes up in transit and also the number of trips needed to eventually ship each item. In practice, it is just as efficient as it sounds and it helps sellers, suppliers and manufacturers alike ship large amounts of goods with ease. In this blog, we will get into the nuances of kitting, including its definition, its role in different business facets, its benefits, and the steps involved in managing the kitting process. What is Meant by Kitting? Kitting refers to the process of grouping and packaging components or subassemblies together to create a final product or kit. This is often used in manufacturing, assembly, or distribution operations, where multiple items are required to complete a single task or project. A kit may consist of raw materials, parts, tools, instructions or any combination of these items that are required to complete a specific task. The components are pre-selected, packaged, and labeled to ensure that everything required is included in one convenient package. This helps to streamline the production process and minimise the need for separate ordering and handling of individual components. Kitting can be done manually or with automated processes such as pick-to-light or barcode scanning systems. The goal of kitting is to save time and improve efficiency by reducing the number of steps involved in picking and packaging components and in mitigating the risk of missing components or incorrect assembly. What are the General Components of a Kit in eCommerce? The components in a kit in eCommerce can vary depending on the specific kit and the industry it is being used in. Some common components that are often included in kits in eCommerce include: Products: The primary components of a kit, which can include physical items such as hardware, electronics, toys, or clothing, as well as digital items like software or online services.Packaging: Kits often include packaging to protect and organize the components, such as a box, bag, or other containers.Instructions: Kits may include instructions or documentation to help customers understand how to use or assemble the components.Accessories: Kits can also include additional accessories, such as adapters, cables, or batteries, that are needed to use or complete the components.Marketing materials: Kits may include promotional or marketing materials, such as flyers, posters, or stickers, to help market the kit and its components. [contactus_lilgoodness] The Primary Roles of Kitting in 2023 Source In Warehousing Kitting is widely used in warehouses as a means to streamline order fulfillment and improve the accuracy of picking and shipping processes. The goal of kitting in a warehouse is to simplify the process of gathering, packaging and shipping multiple items as one unit, thereby reducing the number of individual picking operations required to complete an order. Overall, kitting in a warehouse can improve the efficiency of order fulfillment, reduce the risk of errors, and streamline the supply chain. Here's how kitting is typically used in warehouses: Pre-Assembly: Components are pre-assembled in a warehouse to create a complete kit. This can include items such as hardware, tools, instructions, or packaging materials. The kit is then packaged and labelled to ensure everything required is included in one convenient package.Picking and Packaging: Kits are picked and packaged according to the specific requirements of each order. This can involve the use of automated systems such as barcode scanning or pick-to-light systems to ensure accuracy and efficiency.Shipping: The completed kits are then shipped to customers or other warehouses as required. Shipping kits instead of individual components help to reduce the number of shipments required, which ultimately lowers shipping costs and improves delivery times. In Inventory Management Kitting plays an important role in inventory management by simplifying the tracking and management of multiple items that are used together in a specific product or process. The goal of kitting in inventory management is to reduce the number of separate items that need to be tracked, making it easier to manage stock levels and ensure that the right components are available when needed. Kitting in inventory management helps to simplify the tracking and management of components, limit the risk of stockouts and improve the effectiveness of order fulfillment. Here's how kitting is typically used in inventory management: Kit Creation: A kit is created by grouping multiple items together that are commonly used together in a specific process or product. This can include raw materials, parts, tools, instructions, or any other item that is required to complete a specific task. The kit is then labelled and tracked as a single item in the inventory management system.Inventory Tracking: With kitting, inventory management becomes simpler as the number of separate items that need to be tracked is reduced. This can make it easier to manage stock levels, ensuring that the right components are available when needed.Stock Reordering: Inventory management systems can automatically trigger stock reorders when the levels of components in a kit fall below a predetermined threshold. This helps to ensure that the right components are available when needed, reducing the risk of stockouts and improving customer satisfaction. In Manufacturing Kitting is a widely used practice in manufacturing to streamline the assembly process and improve the accuracy and efficiency of product production. The goal of kitting in manufacturing is to simplify the process of gathering and packaging multiple components that are required to produce a single product. Kitting in the manufacturing industry can improve the efficiency and accuracy of product production, thus reducing the risk of errors and simplifying inventory management. Here's how kitting is typically used in manufacturing: Consolidation of Raw Materials: Components and raw materials are pre-assembled in a manufacturing facility to create a complete kit.

Increases Productivity Source By reducing the amount of time spent searching for parts and gathering materials, kitting can significantly increase productivity. Assemblers can focus on their main task, knowing that the necessary components are all in one place. Additionally, because every important element is pre-packaged and bundled together in a single kit, it prevents the need to have multiple shipments and journeys for multiple products. Reduces Costs Source Kitting can help reduce costs associated with inventory management, such as carrying costs and obsolescence costs. By grouping components together, kitting allows companies to reduce the number of individual items they need to keep in stock, thus reducing the amount of money they need to spend on inventory management. It also requires fewer consignments to be dispatched, reducing transit and storage costs as well, saving the business a significant amount of funds in the process. Enhances Inventory Control Source Kitting makes it easier to track inventory levels, since all the components of a kit can be easily accounted for because they are bundled together in a single shipment. This helps companies maintain accurate inventory levels and reduces the risk of stockouts. Furthermore, kitting necessitates that products of a similar nature and end goal are stored together, making inventory storage more organised. Amplifies Customer Satisfaction Source Kitting can help improve customer satisfaction by providing complete, ready-to-use products that meet their specific needs. Customers are able to receive their products quickly and efficiently, without having to worry about missing parts or assembly errors. Thus, it provides a significant increase in quality and speed by which orders are delivered to their respective customers, enabling an overall better experience. How to Manage the Inventory Kitting Process in Warehousing in 2023? 8 steps involved in the inventory kitting process are mentioned below: Accurately Define the Kit The first step in managing the kitting process is to define the kit by determining which components or parts are needed to create a complete, ready-to-use product. This includes identifying the specific items that should be included within each kit, as well as the quantities needed. Ascertain the Components in the Kit The next step is to determine the components that will be included in each kit. This may involve reviewing product specifications, working with suppliers to obtain components, or creating custom components to ensure that every kit has the required elements necessary to complete the intended task. Gauge the Required Inventory Levels Once the components have been determined, it is important to plan the inventory levels of each component. This involves determining how many kits can be made with the available components and determining how many components will be needed to meet demand. Therefore, inventory levels need to be adjusted accordingly. Efficiently Assemble the Kits After planning the inventory levels, the next step is to assemble the kits. This involves physically grouping the components together and preparing the kits for shipment. This requires an efficient and standardized assembly process to increase efficiency, reduce unwanted errors and save time. Securely Store the Kits The assembled kits need to be placed in a safe and secure environment until they are ready to be shipped. This may involve using warehouse space or using off-site storage if space is limited. Determine the best possible conditions depending on the nature of the contents of the kit. Track Inventory Needed for the Kit It is important to track the inventory levels of the kits to ensure that there is always enough stock to meet demand. This can be achieved using a variety of tools, including barcode scanning, software systems or manual methods. High-end inventory management software can automatically keep you aware of your inventory levels in real-time. Consistently Monitor the Quality of the Kit To ensure that the kits are of the highest quality, it is important to regularly monitor their quality and address any issues that arise. This may involve conducting quality control inspections or working with suppliers to resolve any quality issues. This will help you identify any bottlenecks or processes that need to be improved or removed entirely. Update Components of the Kit as is Required The components of a kit may change over time, so it is important to regularly review and update the components as needed. This may involve working with suppliers to obtain new or improved components or creating custom components as needed. This will help your kits stay relevant and up-to-date with your business objectives. Conclusion: Leverage the Use of Kitting With WareIQ Kitting can be beneficial to retailers in a number of ways.

Since its inception in 2006, the company\u2019s seller base has grown to encompass the aspirations of more than 1.7 million retailers across the world. With the shopping tendencies of customers shifting towards eCommerce on a rapid scale, sellers are constantly under pressure to maintain the right amounts of inventory so that they can fulfill orders swiftly and efficiently. However, there are certain circumstances that cause stockout situations for particular products. If you do not plan accordingly, it can result in lost sales and profits, which can have dire consequences for any business. While the focus should be on ensuring you always have the right quantity of your best-selling SKUs in stock, there are also ways to ensure that you can continue to accept orders and fulfill them at a later date, mitigating the dissatisfaction caused by products being out of stock. In this blog, we will take a look at the circumstances under which you should continue selling when out of stock on Shopify, the advantages of doing so, steps to continue selling your items, and 5 tips to follow. The Circumstances Under Which You Should Continue Selling When Out of Stock on Shopify While selling products on Shopify, an item is deemed as being out of stock when the inventory level for it is at zero or lower. By default, Shopify won't permit buyers to purchase a product when you run out of the required number of units needed to fulfill current and future orders until you replenish the inventory levels and add the necessary quantity of new stock. Once that is done and the default setting is modified, customers will then be able to purchase out-of-stock products from that item\u2019s inventory section. You might want to let customers purchase products that aren't currently in stock for a number of reasons. The main ones are listed below: You want to enable pre-orders for a newly launched itemYou want to keep selling while you wait for your upcoming stock to arriveYou intend to initially sell items, followed by ordering the necessary suppliesYou aren\u2019t keeping track of the actual level of inventory for various productsYou do not want to lose out on potential sales [contactus_uth] How Do You Benefit From Selling Products When Out of Stock on Shopify? Prevents Customer Dissatisfaction If you continue selling when out of stock on Shopify, you can halt upsetting your clients. You can keep your consumers informed about all the products you sell, making it simpler for them to make purchases even when a product is out of stock. They will appreciate the transparency and the ability to buy a product or add them to a wish list even if they cannot get it right away. You also won't lose out on Shopify sales opportunities by employing Back In Stock alerts as opposed to simply out-of-stock products. This is because clicking the \"notify me\" button indicates that you'll soon refill your consumers' preferred goods. So they only need to submit their email to receive a notification when the item again becomes available for purchase. Enables Accurate Inventory Planning You can make smarter inventory planning decisions by looking at the waiting list for a product that's out of stock and selling products when out of stock on Shopify. When a product has a long waitlist, you will be aware of the number of units you need to order and can make the necessary arrangements. You can also make smaller orders in the interim if there is a short queue for another item. Additionally, you might want to think about reducing the price or discontinuing the sale of a product if no one is waiting for it, which will also help you discern how successful it is. Maintains Your Sales Figures According to research, when customers are confronted by out-of-stock product pages, retailers risk losing close to half of the intended orders. For a typical seller, those abandoned transactions result in sales losses of roughly 4%. According to Harvard Business Review, 7% to 25% of customers who encounter a stock-out will keep browsing but won't purchase a replacement for their desired item at your business. Additionally, 21% to 43% will actually go to another store to purchase their desired item. Therefore, if you give customers the option of purchasing an item even if they have to wait more time for it, there are more chances that they will choose it as opposed to browsing for it elsewhere. Suggested Read: How to Handle out-of-stock items? Steps to Sell Products on Shopify if They are Out of Stock New Product Listings Source You can enable the option to make your products visible while they are out of stock when you first list your products. The first step is usually already selected by default. Follow the below procedures to continue selling when out of stock on Shopify while listing new products: Step 1: While creating a new product listing, click the \u201cTrack Inventory\u201d checkbox in the \u201cInventory\u201d sectionStep 2: Below the checkbox, there will be an additional \u201cContinue Selling When Out of Stock\u201d option that you need to enable Existing Product Listings Source You can edit current product listings in bulk, which enables you to make a change on a single listing and apply it to all of your other existing products. Follow the below procedures to continue selling when out of stock on Shopify for existing product listings: Step 1: Scroll to the \u201cProducts\u201d tab and select \u201cAll Products\u201dStep 2: Select all of the products you have currently listedStep 3: Click on the \u201cEdit Products\u201d optionStep 4: After the spreadsheet shows on your screen, select \u201cAdd Fields\u201d and then choose \u201cContinue Selling When Out of Stock\u201dStep 5: Select the tick boxes at the side of all the products you want to continue selling once they are out of stock Suggested Read: 15 Most Common Mistakes To Avoid When Using Shopify for Your Retail Business in 2023 5 Simple Ways of Selling Products When Out of Stock on Shopify in 2023 Suggest Alternative Products Source You should think about including a section in the product descriptions for related items that are available on your site to continue selling when out of stock on Shopify. It is imperative to give your clients some recommendations for substitute products so they might find other options equally appealing and eventually buy a few of them. This is a strategic tactic, especially if the out-of-stock products generate a lot of traffic from other sources. Many Shopify themes allow you to place the related products tab directly under the product information. You can experiment with the messaging as well. For instance,  you write something along the lines of \u201cTake a look at similar products that we offer while this item comes back in stock\u201d rather than just \"Related Products.\" Place Out of Stock Items Last on Product Lists Source Your clients won't be able to buy a product if it's sold out. Therefore, there is no purpose in displaying a product that is not currently available for purchase. Therefore, the out-of-stock goods need to be placed last on various product and category lists to prevent them from being easily visible and accessible to customers, who may end up trying to purchase them, only to run into a variety of hurdles. Sadly, there is no way to accomplish this directly through your Shopify admin panel. But in the same way that some Shopify applications let you include a \"Notify Me\" option to your listing pages, there are other apps that let you move the items that aren't presently available and conceal them at the bottom of your page. Refrain From Hiding Out of Stock Items Source On their websites, some retailers prefer to hide or remove out of stock products from the view of customers. When you do this, you end up directing your clients to nonexistent pages and 404 errors, which is a recipe for disaster and can make them lose faith in your brand. If you have connected that item to an ongoing social media marketing effort, it can get even worse because leads will flock to your site, only to be disappointed. If you want to continue selling products when out of stock on Shopify, simply give people the option of buying them at a later date. This will ensure you continue to get sales and will also ensure that customers don\u2019t get a long-lasting negative impression of your business. Inform Customers When Products are Sold Out Source It is important to inform your customers that certain items are currently out of stock after placing them in a strategically out-of-sight way. So, on the collection page of your shopify website, you must place a \u201cSold-Out\u201d banner upfront on the relevant listing pages so that customers will be instantly informed. However, only do this for the items you have no intention of selling or restocking in a hurry. Your clients will be able to tell which items are available and which are not, thanks to this, which will prompt them to continue browsing other products that are available. Shopify uses a unique HTML class, so out of stock goods can be targeted using a custom CSS. Because of this, you will need to work with code and perhaps enlist the aid of a programmer. Provide an Option for Customers to Get Notified Source You must provide your clients with a suitable solution to continue selling when out of stock on Shopify. By including a \"Notify Me\" in an accessible location on the listing pages of every out of stock item, you can allow customers to indicate their interest in purchasing that item. Customers can enter their email address or phone number when they click the button, allowing you to add them to the waiting list and send them an alert when the product is back in stock. Remember that if a product has multiple variants, each inventory variant must be edited independently. To add a \"Notify me\" button to your store, simply browse the back-in-stock alert applications in the Shopify app, shopify plus store and choose an appropriate option.
