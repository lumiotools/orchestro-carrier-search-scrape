After TWO WHOLE days my parcel has moved from Bow E3 to Docklands E14, my 'parcel' which is actually one sheet of A4 paper, put on hold, due to security issues as my surname is 'Khan' and I have to provide proof of my ID either by sending a copy of my passport or drivers license (or any other government issued documen). Scam. Scammers. Date of experience: October 31, 2024MGMichael Gare-Simmons24 reviewsESUpdated Nov 4, 2024They have breached UK lawsI reported on Trustpilot a problem with the DHL parcel service that failed to comply to their service agreement.  Making this report I was contacted by a DHL employer who said he was there to help. Then nothing until another person emailed me requesting for security that I send him my personal details over an open email line. I asked if he was mad and requested a secure mail line. I did offer the Waybill number which would have all the information he required. To date nothing from DHl. It now leaves me no other option but to sue DHL for breach of contract and failing to comply to the Standards Trading Act 2015. Fortunately I have good evidence and an independent witness.

The first started out in CA, went to VA and then was somehow in both places at the same time. It’s now back in CA? All this was in one day. The tracking hasn’t updated in 6 days. The second package (from a different company) also started out in the same city in CA and went to VA in less than 2 hours. I don’t have much hope I’ll get either one. This isn’t the first time I’ve had poor service from DHL. Date of experience: November 07, 2024Sian Barnett24 reviewsGBNov 1, 2024Worst delivery company everWorst delivery company ever! I will say however, it is somewhat impressive to actually be worse than the cowboys at Evri, but somehow DHL have managed it.They failed to deliver my parcel not once, but three times, on each occasion claiming it was because my property could not be accessed due to a road closure. This was completely fabricated by the driver. In the time that this road was supposedly closed, Amazon, Sainsbury’s and amazingly even Evri managed to deliver parcels. As did the postman. My partner managed to commute the 70 miles to work every day. I wonder how they managed to do this? Was it magic? Ended up telling DHL to keep the parcel as I’ll be lodging a formal complaint with the sender.

Very disappointed and unlikely to use DHL again.Date of experience: October 29, 2024KEkenorb23 reviewsGBNov 5, 2024Can't delivery anythingI've bought HDDs from Europe to be send to the UK, it took over 2 weeks, extra charges and still not able to deliver. Out of blue they've asked me to pay £100+ for duty taxes (not all, some were extra charges by them for no reason). I've tried to paid at the end, but couldn't login to their website, because you're forced to type code from text which I didn't get any. Struggling to login to their website for few days, finally I did and paid. The next day I see, the package is marked as to Return to shipper. So they were first to took my money, but never delivered the package. Now I'm struggling to contact them to give back my money back, they've 3 days to respond. Pathetic. The 2nd class via Royal Post could be more reliable, cheaper and faster.I think it's going to be quicker and more reliable if I just take a commercial flight and go to that shop in person to collect the item once they send it back to sender, if DHL won't lost or damage it in transit on the way back.Support contacts and their communication is non-existent. It's a ghost company.Date of experience: October 21, 2024Advertisementrob74 reviewsGBOct 30, 2024DHL and O2  a match made in NO CUSTOMER SERVICE HEAVEN DHL and O2, thank you for inviting feedback which they never do anything about. I’ve faced repeated issues with DHL failing to deliver my orders accurately or on time, despite my address being highly visible. Additionally, O2’s customer service (that is a joke) support has been slow and challenging to reach, with prolonged wait times to find out where DHL has lost my parcel THIS time.

DHL took payment, collected the parcel and we were then told they are refusing to send it and we have 7 days to collect it at our own expense before it's destroyed because the parcel was opened up and \"staff did some googling on car polishes and saw that sometimes they're flammable\" despite being told in no uncertain terms from the manufacturer that the formulations have been calculated using Lycos software as per the legal requirement for sale or transport and deemed non hazardous. How are we supposed to declare the hazard statements if they don't have any? We were then told you can't send any liquids by air without a complete breakdown of all ingredients, including non hazardous, which is simply a load of Bull.S... .We've been sending out several consignments a day for the last 15 or 20 years and are aware of how the transport regulations work.This has to be one of the most bizarre and unbelievable situations we've ever had to deal with.

Only went with them ( dhl ecommerce) because they were the cheapest but only a bit less than other couriers.Once I paid, confirmation of collection next day received so all looked ok. However, I received few more emails and texts messages from them some to confirm collection day, one email say will cancel and refund and another one to reschedule. Anyway, I rescheduled another day and chose to drop it off instead if collection but a driver with private van knocked on the door and said all ready to go. I explained to him the situation but he confirms all ok. In hind sight, he was someone like amazon driver and has not much to do with dhl, they work to pick up and deliver to a warehouse. I still had hope it will be ok.After three days it changed the status to delivered, I was surprised because it was an international shipment. I called them few times over few days and every-time it takes more than one hour to talk to someone. The call centre staff are polite but they can’t help because it turned out dhl give the parcel to a third company. Anyway I was given a track code for belgian post to deliver to a country in the Middle East. Now it is two months and no sign for the parcel. Dozen of emails with unhelpful replies stating the parcel was delivered but no one is taking my claim serious that it is not delivered. The belgian post says it is still on its way. I simply asked them this simple question after 20odd emails- have you lost the parcel? As this may make me feel better and stop hoping that a reputable company like dhl still do a professional job.

Each day they waited until the last moment before updating the website to state that they had failed to deliver that day. Completely useless.

I did NOT AT ALL SIGN, I was not even in the house the day they said it apparently arrived. Called customer service, absolutely awful. The guy spoke really quietly, wasn't friendly, didn't sound at all bothered about my situation, left my on hold for a really long time, I could barely understand him when he spoke, (very strong accent and made no effort to be understood, mumbling as well). He then mumbled that my parcel was with my neighbour. Why didn't the tracking service say that in the first place instead of saying it was signed by ME at my address???? Rubbish.

After a couple of days waiting for an update I decided to phone the pick-up point....yes we have your parcel. Nothing from DHL telling me it was even out for delivery. Arrived at pick-up point, they wouldn't give me the parcel as I had no pick-up code. Yes that's why I phoned you because DHL haven't given me anything! So tried to contact DHL via customer contact number, didn't get to speak to anyone as after numerous options selected on their 'helpline' I was told I needed to go onto the website regarding pick-up code requests. Tried their 'chat' function which was useless before telling me 'we're now closed' but wished me a good day. After several attempts getting nowhere I just opted for the form to fill out. Now I've to wait another 3-4 working days to progress this further. Date of experience: October 28, 2024Carey Mason1 reviewGBOct 30, 2024Sooo bad. AVOIDDDSooo bad.

Who cant use an intercom in 2024?Date of experience: October 30, 2024Advertisementabdikarin Ibrahim1 reviewUSNov 5, 2024I requested that the shipment be opened…I requested that the shipment be opened so that the documents, including the passport, could be retrieved, while the phone could be kept for further decision on whether to return it or not. They asked me to write a letter granting permission, which I did, but it was denied. This process has been a complete waste of time, and I’ve found their approach unprofessional and disrespectful.Yesterday, my wife went to pick up the documents, as they’re not taxable, yet they refused to release them. The DHL employees there are working with customs to hold the documents until we pay an additional $700, which is unacceptable, especially since I’ve already paid $60. When I called to request the return of the shipment, they informed me that, due to the initial payment, there’s now an entry, and unless we pay the full amount, they won’t release anything—not even my passport.I trusted that DHL had strong partnerships with all its international locations and would cover these types of issues. I should not have to navigate the processes of a foreign country in this way.I shipped this package urgently because it was time-sensitive. Now, nearly two weeks later, I am still struggling to retrieve my son’s passport. His visa is close to expiring, and if we don’t resolve this soon, I’ll have to start the entire process from scratch. This situation has caused significant distress.I want the documents released, I can’t wait for another 2-3 weeks. We can discuss about the phone later. At this point, my trust in DHL has been severely damaged, and I am committed to sharing my experience with the public.

No offering to compensate or anything after someone from their customer service already told me if they couldn’t locate it they would refund it.

I received a package from Hong Kong, paid a hefty customs fee — all fine.2. The product didn’t meet my expectations, so I returned it. The company I bought from provided and prepaid a return label.3. The package was picked up \"for free\", 4. later that week FedEx charged me €330 — wrongfully — despite the prepaid label.Since then, getting this €330 refunded has been a nightmare. I’ve made countless inquiries, only to receive generic, auto-responses. Every attempt to reach an actual human has hit a brick wall. Here’s what I’ve encountered:• The hotline connects me to a virtual assistant who just cycles through automated responses.• For over three weeks, every attempt to speak to a real person has ended with: “Customer support is experiencing high demand, please call back later.”• I’ve submitted four support forms, tried calling at different times — and still, no resolution or even a single person looking into this issue.This process has been incredibly time-consuming and frustrating, all for a simple refund that should never have been charged in the first place. FedEx, it’s time to take a hard look at your customer support process. A global brand should not operate like this. Just imagine a small or midsized company would operate this way...Would appreciate if someone from FedEx help resolve this.Date of experience: November 06, 2024NENeil1 reviewCAOct 31, 2024Garbage Carrier My package shipped 2 days ago, and the only update has been \"shipping label created\".

All of my attempts have been unsuccessful, you can’t make it past the automated system. The only thing that can manage to be said is “your package was delivered!” Not a single person seems to care about the mistake, I guess it doesn’t matter no because it doesn’t affect them.

I contacted both, the shipper and Fedex, both of them relieve themselves of their responsibilities to refund for the missing package !Fedex, I think it's time for you to close your business, delivery is clearly not your strong point.Date of experience: October 26, 2024AdvertisementLouis Pasteur1 reviewUSOct 30, 2024FedEX was name as a Federal ExpressFedEX was name as a Federal Express. However, the incompetence I encountered is destroying the image of \"Federal\" name. I sent one tooth crown to Armenia, and Armenian custom services fooled FedEx not letting them either give it to the receoient or bring it back to me. All their customer services did was to aplologize and say they are working on it without any timing. If I walked that crown from USA to Armenia it probably would be faster and more efficient.

They continuously leave my packages in the mail room. I called customer service and complained and of course they reassured me it won't happen again. But it still does. More than often those packages are over 40 lbs and it is a struggle for me (female 130lbs) to get it upstairs. I hate FedEx!!!Date of experience: October 31, 2024RJRawkey Johnson6 reviewsUS7 days agoMajor safety riskI am disabled and very limited in my ability to move and lift things... Yet again some delivery driver has chosen to leave my package out in the rain instead of under the covered porch by the front door. He placed it outside of my gate to the driveway just feet from the covered porch but the worst part is that this heavy delivery (has a large bag of dog food in one of the boxes) is placed directly against the gate which swings out... What if there was a fire? I definitely cannot push to open the gate with these things stacked there (3 boxes total, 2 heavy). This is absolutely inexcusable to block doors or gates and i went to the website to provide feedback for them so they could remind their drivers and train them properly but instead of accepting feedback on the site it just tells you that you have to call. Im not going to sit on the phone on hold for this so i guess a bad review will have to suffice. This is an issue any time we get a driver that is not our regular guy (our regular guy is usually good). Train your drivers. Also the small package has a sticker on it that says live animals... Maybe dont just leave that in the rain/snow/sleet we are having. That was super rude. I hope they survive until i get home.Date of experience: November 06, 2024Previous15671386Next pageCompany activitySee allClaimed profileHasn’t replied to negative reviewsAdvertisementAbout FedExInformation written by the companyShipping - Logistics Management - Supply Chain Management from\nFedEx Corporation: FedEx.com offers a complete suite of online services for shipment preparation, package tracking,\nshipment rates and tools tailored to the needs of international shippers and small businesses.ContactUnited KingdomCategoriesCar Accessories StoreCourier ServicePeople who looked at this company also looked atUPS37,162ClaimedDHL17,665ClaimedFedex6,730UnclaimedSuggested companies are based on people’s browsing tendencies.The Trustpilot ExperienceWe're open to allAnyone can write a Trustpilot review.

Books and got no contact from helpers to verify the job. I reached out to support and reget it did, waste of time and rude.Date of experience: May 23, 2023PAPaula3 reviewsUSMay 19, 2023Ghosted by Dolly and they ask for a tip? Really?How I wish I could give zero stars to Dolly,  I booked a simple move. Medium sized table, one piece, move from one garage to another garage six miles away. What could go wrong???   I first received a text indicating the move had started, 'So far, so good' I thought.  Then I received another text noting that Phil D. Was parked in front of my house behind a white Tahoe.  'What? I've been sitting in my garage for 30 min., no Tahoe around. Where is this guy?'. I texted several times. Crickets from Phil D.  Called the Dolly Help Line. Listen to lame message, wait, get disconnected. Call back and selected 'call me when agent is available' option. Shari called back and said the job was complete and the table was delivered. Who has my table. It's not in my garage!  Then Shari tells a different story. Nobody was available at the pickup location so Phil D. left. A quick text told a different story. There was someone waiting, nobody rang her door bell, the dogs never barked. There was no white Tahoe (they have black escalade and sports car in driveway). Now I'm mad. Dolly has no solution to the multiple errors they made. To top it off, they charged my credit card, asked me to tip Phil D and leave a review.  So now I still have no table, will rent a truck myself to complete the move, disputed the credit card charges, will start small claims court proceedings next week if necessary and WILL NEVER USE DOLLY AGAIN.  The inconvenience, stress, poor customer service, need to revise plans and make arrangements to rent a truck and move the table myself resulted in a big headache. Dolly needs to upgrade their communications system so they can actually put a customer on hold rather than continually hanging up and calling me back ('really, this is 2023...'), improve their delivery service continuity, and so much more to have a viable business model. Do yourself a favor and find a moving solution that avoids Dolly at all costs so you don't end up with a headache (and a missing table) like I have right now!Update on 5/18. I had several unsettling interactions with DollyCS reps.  Ask to speak to a supervisor or manager instead of hearing scripted language. Tonight Jack couldn't locate anyone with whom I could speak and took my phone number.  I disputed the charge with my cc company and have a demand letter written prior to filing in small claims court.  Do I send it to Scott Prad and Mike Howell, listed on the State of Washington business registration website?  This company gets sketchier and sketchier.  Best to avoid doing business with Dolly at all costs!Date of experience: May 13, 2023HAHarrison2 reviewsUSApr 21, 2023Great Idea; Terrible Execution; Worse Customer ServiceI needed help moving a single, large, heavy item. From their website and the initial forms I filled out, Dolly, seemed like a great fit for this need. I submitted a request to have two helpers assist me with this move. I listed my single item in the move details and was matched with a helper who was willing and able to assist with this. Everything seemed to be going great thus far.Dolly, only permits you to request up to two helpers per job. I felt that three or four people would be needed to safely complete this move. As a result, I submitted another identical request to have additional movers help with the job. I was matched with another helper who informed me that even though I was paying nearly $80, they were receiving less than $15 for their services. As a result, they declined to assist me with this job and told me I would need to cancel it and try again. I did so, but got matched with the same individual who again told me that they were not willing to assist with this job.I then contacted Dolly's support team to explain my situation and ask if there was anything they could do to assist me in finding someone to help out with this job. Shortly thereafter I received a very generic response only notifying me that job had been cancelled. When I checked my account, I found that not only the problematic job/reservation had been cancelled but additionally my initial reservation with the helper who was willing to assist me had also been cancelled. This was a very disappointing surprise.I assumed this was the result of some sort of mistake by Dolly's customer support team, so I followed up via email to explain what had happened and ask for the initial reservation to be un-cancelled/reinstated. The response that I received again felt like a generic, canned response and indicated that my \"moving needs are beyond the scope of what our Dolly Helpers are able to complete\". If moving a single item off a truck and into my house is \"beyond the scope of what Dolly Helpers are able to complete\", then what type of jobs are Dolly's helpers able to complete?!?I am now less than 48 hours from having this item arrive and I am scrambling to find a team to help unload it from the truck it will arrive on. I am extremely disappointed in my experience trying to use Dolly's service and strongly recommend for others to avoid their service to spare themselves from this same type of frustration.Date of experience: April 19, 2023PAPauline1 reviewUSMay 2, 2023This company is a scamThis company is a scam.  I had to move my apartment, took pictures of everything. I booked a covered truck and talked to the owner of the truck before he showed up.  He said it would only take a few trips and it would be fine.  When he showed up, he came with a dirty looking van. It looked like a homeless person was living at the back of it. None of my stuff was going to go in there.  Top it off my storage where I was moving my things to was 30 minutes away. It would’ve taken 10 trips.  Mind you that’s 10 hours round-trip.  They showed up around two or 3 PM.  So basically they would’ve been done by 3 AM. A 10 hour move.  A few trips is not 10 trips.  So in the end I payed a cancellation fee because I would not use their services. It was $200.  Do not use Dolly if you want peace of mind.  They will not take care of you, they don’t care about their clients.  I tried to call and let them know what was happening and they said someone would get back to me. No one did and I had to keep calling back. Cat and mouse game. Then eventually they let me know that I chose the size of the vehicle. Yes, I did, with the service provider having all of the photos said it would only take a few trips. Who’s fault is this?  Also I would think that a professional service would have a professional looking vehicle.  Nightmare.

I understand paying a little more for convenience but be UPFRONT about it. They are slipping it into their app nonchalantly without our acknowledgement or consent for the gouged prices.

This company should be forced out of business. They exploit drivers who are in need of extra cash. The worst part? They refuse to display the customer’s address before drivers accept or decline an order. Smaller paid orders are shorter distances, but if the pay is a few dollars more, expect to drive up to 22 minutes away. Also, why drivers aren’t able to see customer receipts? I’d like to verify if the tip shown is actually what the customer intended to give. There’s no way shorter trips are consistently paying the same low amount. I see a major lawsuit on the horizon—this is pure greed and deception!Date of experience: October 06, 2024Ralph James1 reviewUSOct 12, 2024Terrible companyTerrible company. Ordered food with special instructions. They delivered incorrect order. It was NOT the restaurants fault, it was ALL DoorDash's problem by sending the wrong order. The food was wasted because it was not what I like to eat. Contacted DoorDash Customer support they basically disavowed any responsibility.

Doordash was okay at first but quickly went downhill. My latest and last \"purchase\" wasn't a purchase at all.... I ordered groceries from Aldi and they couldn't find a Dasher so instead of telling me my order couldn't be placed, they took the order anyway and then proceeded to take my money and say that there was nobody available to fulfill the order and that I would get a refund within 3 days. Well, still waiting for my refund. I will never use doordash again. They screw people over.

I received a different order, different food that my boys would not eat at all. Wasted food. Wasted money. DoorDash have no regard on how I devoted money just to give my boys a good food. Not all of your clients are rich. Some are saving money just to provide a decent food at the table by ordering food through DoorDash.

Dashers will eat/drink your food and when you turn to customer support for help, they will hang up on you. Customer support agents intentionally hung up on me twice. Both the dashers and customer service agents are unprofessional and rude. To me, that says a lot about the CEO and the culture at DoorDash. I am still shocked that a business like this is so popular. I immediately cancelled my DoorDash subscription and will never return.

They do not care about clients at all. I’ve dealt with theft, poorly handled food items, health risks and other unsafe food management issues. Then if something is blatantly wrong (missing items or stolen items), they deny your request for refund, forcing you to go through a chargeback with your cc. I highly doubt they do thorough background checks either, based on some of my more scary experiences.  I used to be a subscriber, but I’m done. I hope they go bankrupt.

You don’t tip any of us drivers out here delivering your food order as you are very capable to get off your butt and go drive your own vehicle to get your own food. I made a bunch of deliveries in the Killeen & Harker Heights area and NO ONE in this area ever leaves a tip, maybe just maybe a handful do, but as for the rest don’t. You people are very selfish and don’t even realize the wear and tear on tires, gas and oil changes, the least thing you can do if you order from Door Dash is tip your drivers once your food is delivered!!Date of experience: September 27, 2024Greg Ewing2 reviewsUSSep 29, 2024As a merchantAs a merchant, Uber Eats is far superior to DoorDash. Getting customer service to help is worse than pulling teeth. Nobody can even tell me if I have an account after we canceled an account transfer when the buyer pulled out of a sale of the business. Uber Eats transferred back to the original owner in 30 minutes. DoorDash can't even direct my call to whoever I need to speak about the issue. Very, very poor merchant support.

We beat up our vehicles for mere dollars. It's very disappointing when you get a rather large order for practically no pay & then it goes 10 miles & your lucky to see $6-8 for delivering it. And many customers don't seem to realize we hardly make anything to bring them their food. Come on people do better. You can tip us after the delivery or at the door. Oh & I'm one of the few good guys out there doing this to have a few bucks in my pocket. Oftentimes it's the stores that mess up orders not drivers. I've yet in almost 6yrs delivered to wrong address. I had someone give a complaint because the store sloppily bagged their food. I'm always careful. Don't always blame your driver.

They now have expanded into grocery delivery and honestly this is truly beyond this company. As others stated the promotions obviously are false or can't be implemented at the stores or understood by the Dasher.Was offered 50 percent off at a local grocery store on October 19. The app told me a Dasher was on the way for 3 hours. Then the Dasher turned off the messaging on the app. Showed me that the Dasher had checked out. But 3 hours later still no delivery. Now into 6 hours with a pre-order the day before no less and payment approved. Did speak with customer service who admitted the Dasher had turned off their phone yet all they could do was issue a 5 dollar credit and refund my money after 10 days.I don't even think there ever WAS a Dasher and this went on for an entire 8 hour day. This company really has to stick to simple orders and ensure they have Dashers who want to do groceries.

KirkWooD PizzA is the exact name.It has been 4 months since we decided to remove Doordarsh from our restaurant and it has been 4 months of constant harassment calls, random drivers showing up pretending to be picking up orders. Entire management has one goal and that's to brush you off as soon as possible. We've spoke to management so many times and we are still being harassed on daily basis.As a store owner, I will not allow a shady company like Doordarsh to partner up with us and now they are not making money from us (35%) on orders plus the fees customers pay.

The problem is that DoorDash wants to offload the cost of these incorrect orders onto the buyer. Even when I had DashPass, if I tried to get a refund I would get pop-ups saying \"you have problems with your orders a lot, we're going to have to review your complaint.\" Now that I don't have DashPass, I won't even get a full refund for what was missing. Over the last week my husband and I have been sick, so we ordered delivery four times, and every single order had items missing. We usually get carryout when we're not sick and almost never have missing items, yet easily half of our deliveries over the last couple of years from DoorDash have been missing something, so it seems as if restaurants have discovered that they can get away with partial orders on DD. Complaints only get you partial refunds. Lately I've been leaving negative reviews for restaurants that were purposely omitting part of our orders, but DoorDash won't post those reviews publicly. The whole thing feels like a scam.Date of experience: October 21, 2024Read 1 more review about DoorDashEX-Soldier Boy1 reviewUSOct 11, 2024I would give this -10 stars if i couldI would give this -10 stars if i could. The company deserves to burn itself to the ground in bankruptcy and the employees and employer can work a real job like the rest of us.The company is unprofessional, and mismanagement and poor direction allows people to get paid a huge tip to bring groceries, meanwhile a store can get 100s of dollars from the transaction, and the poor people who purchased it all never got it ever. again.and Door Dash does not even go out of its way to react to said situations. The consume has to go out of their way to address the problems and ask for resolution from incompetent staff without decent social skills. They are not progressive and especially not proactive in their work ethic.

Of course it was cold, but nothing new. I ordered a big breakfast and a sausage, egg and cheese mcmuffin. I didn't get the big breakfast at all and received the sandwich and a hash brown, which I did not order. I called door dash customer service and they said they had to review it.

Date of experience: October 18, 2024Jonathan15 reviewsUSOct 16, 2024Constantly frustratingWe have been using DoorDash for over a year now, and the experience has been consistent. (1) We pay DOUBLE what we would pay by going to a restaurant because we have to take on our fees and the restaurant's fees when placing an order, which makes it difficult to afford anything...especially with a driver tip added on. (2) They always group our deliveries with other people's orders, and this wouldn't normally be an issue, but we ALWAYS get our food last, whether they have to pass my house and come back or not. They are not great at logistics. (3) We often end up with missing or incorrect items, and they usually give us a credit, but that doesn't actually feed you. I can't eat credits. That's why I ordered food. (4) Their customer service team has been pushing back lately when asking for help rather than taking accountability and immediately trying to fix the issue. (5) Several restaurants opt out of allowing special instructions, which are definitely needed when you have a health issue. This makes no sense since you can walk in their door and customize...this shouldn't be any different. Date of experience: October 16, 2024DarthDooku1 reviewUSOct 19, 2024Wow!

I called them 3 times and the person on the phone kept telling me they will get back to me in an hour, they never did, so i told the lady on the phone I'm going to delete my account, which I did, the hassle is not worth it.Date of experience: October 05, 2024Lauren D Martin6 reviewsCAOct 8, 2024I always hated the customer service…I always hated the customer service with this app, but yesterday one of their drivers came into St James Spirit Halloween and was horrible to staff.  He got very hostile when we didn’t have the item (green stuffed Oogie Boogie) on his order, and began angrily and loudly Demanding we go look for the item, which we kept telling him was on a truck on the way to the store and wouldn’t be Available for hours, and that we didn’t have it. He bothered three different staff members about this, he was incredibly rude, only spoke enough English to make hostile demands, and angry gestures , and finally left after 15 minutes. He was talking to friends on the phone the entire time. We get insacart in all the time and they’re always polite. it got to the point that the store manager was about to kick him out. Their staff is untrained and has zero customer service. Worst delivery app out there. Date of experience: October 07, 2024Chris Partin1 reviewUSOct 17, 2024This company sucks nowThis company sucks now. Their policies are terrible. If a burger costs $6.50 and I don’t even receive it in the bag, they’ll give me something like $5.25. They can’t even refund me the full price of the item, let alone any of the fees it takes! When the food arrives low quality or bad, they just take your complaint, tell you there’s no refund available, and will close the item so you can’t complain about it or review it.DoorDash has gone severely downhill in the last 2-3 years. I got rid of my DashPash, and deleted the app. Even if I do end up going back to a delivery service, it won’t be Door Dash. Utterly disappointed in how awful their policies and customer service is now. They’ve made me feel like an afterthought and like their users don’t matter at all.Do anything else to get your food delivered. Don’t get DoorDash.

The app worked well and they worked hard to build business.   They have continued building great levels of business, but around app version 2.21 things broke and I have been unable to secure quite literally, any work, from their platform despite seeing notifications all day.   Their google play and iphone market reviews reinforce this fact.     The company's app and dispatch system is completely broken.    To go from working for them routinely, to never being able to secure a single load has been both infuriating and extremely disappointing.    Their competitors use rotational offer models in addition to free floating first come first serve offers.     I can secure work on any other platform at my disposal.   Since mid 2022 it has become impossible for 90%+ of their registered driver base to even get the chance to attempt to secure any opportunities for work. Until Frayt fixes their completely broken platform and application, I cannot recommend anyone ship through them, or onboard as a driver.    I was told over a year ago that they were aware of how bad the issue is and that they were rebuilding the application from scratch in an attempt to fix it.   Not a single update has been pushed since.   We can only assume that a select group of drivers with unique OS and hardware builds are gaining access to each and every load offered on the platform.       There are many competitors with functioning tech stacks.    As a driver, I urge you to use any competitor until this issue is resolved as we find this incredibly harmful to our logistics ecosystem at present.     In 2020-2021 I would have recommended Frayt above all others.  This is simply no longer the case.    It's incredibly sad to see this happen to this company.Date of experience: January 04, 2023MMMoises Morel2 reviewsUSMay 31, 2023InvitedServices and payment are ok but no too…Services and payment are ok but no too much work at all need more freight that people work with youDate of experience: May 31, 2023VWV Williams1 reviewUSMay 18, 2023InvitedI like it so far...I wish there was…I like it so far...I wish there was more gigs available but its seems  cool so far...Some of the pick-ups are questionable with the pay but overall ok.Date of experience: May 18, 2023Previous134511Next pageCompany activitySee allClaimed profileAsks for reviews — positive or negativeHasn’t replied to negative reviewsAdvertisementAbout Frayt TechnologiesInformation written by the companyWith 15,000 nationwide drivers, FRAYT offers on-demand and routed deliveries across nearly 50 markets.

Some of which were just too far for the amount of pay and mileage. After that, it slowed down considerably. I was hopeful, and wanted to believe that Frayt was going to be one of the best gigs out there...nope. It's rare to catch an order, even with the app open and ready. As soon as I click on accept, it's gone right before my eyes, as if it were never there. This wasn't happening before, and I don't believe that there are many drivers in my area. There's something going on behind the scenes that needs to be fixed. I was told by tech support that they are working on some things, but this is ridiculous. They updated the app, and it isn't any better. I get bumped out, out of nowhere, and have to literally log back in. I used to pick up from a business twice a day, almost every day. The last time that I was there, I was told that I was the third person who came to pick up the same order that had been canceled by the customer. He said that he had informed Frayt three times about the cancellation, but drivers kept showing up. He said that he didn't like Frayt, and I have not seen a request come from that business since.Date of experience: October 03, 2023AdvertisementRURuth1 reviewUSMay 26, 2023InvitedWhenever I reach out for helpWhenever I reach out for help, people are pretty quick to respond and provide a solutionDate of experience: May 03, 2023CUcustomer2 reviewsMAJun 8, 2023InvitedSomething wrong with the app I couldn't…Something wrong with the app I couldn't get any job ..

The team behind is always open for feedback. This is how I imagine also the future of customer centric product development in the digital Banking environment. The best part you can completely trust this platform because you are always in control and possession of your funds and not the platform operator.Date of experience: June 20, 2020leigh pierce3 reviewsGBSep 4, 2021For a company that wants to be a bankFor a company that wants to be a bank, their fiat on ramp is bank transfer only still. No credit or debit card purchases on trading website.From an investors perspective ( of which I am one) bad investment so far. I staked around 1000 NEX tokens 2 years ago costing around 2000 dollars. I have made a grand total of around 14 dollars in 2 years of staking, which is an annual return of around 0.35% APR, which is basically rubbish and reflects the fact that despite NASH exchange being online for over year now I think, their exchange volumes are very small in comparison to other exchanges.They have not been doing a monthly average exchange volume of 50 million dollars as they claim in reply below, last time I checked it was 2.5 million dollars and the highest was 15 million dollars in march 2021. Also My initial investment is now worth half of what I paid. Their Token price has flatlined for a long time.Their marketing seems poor. They dont stand out from the competition and the team don't seem to like constructive criticism. They should in my opinion keep things simple and basic, not try to do too many things at once, stick to their goals and emphases their core advantages over other exchanges. Like being non-custodial as an option.I would say to them that they should follow a simple   model of:1. offering returns on assets held.2. Trading and non-custodial trading option, 3. Descent fiat on ramps 4. Low trading fees. That is it. that's all they need to do and that beats the competition because as far as I am aware no other exchange offers all of these features together. There is no other exchange that is decentralised like Nash.Conclusion:Poor, could do better. It was a good idea ( con-custodial exchange ) that got out of hand or rather not even in hand in the first place!Date of experience: September 04, 2021Reply from NashJan 17, 2024Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts and concerns with us. We understand your perspective and appreciate your honest feedback as an investor in NEX tokens. We value our community's opinions, and we want to address some of the points you've raised.Regarding your observation on the fiat on-ramp and trading options, we appreciate your insights.

We appreciate your suggestions, particularly the emphasis on simplicity, basic functionality, and highlighting our core advantages.Your comments on marketing, team response to criticism, and the need for a streamlined approach are also duly noted and appreciated. We'd like to clarify some points mentioned in your review:> We would be launching debit cards soon to go with IBAN accounts for users.> The Layer-2 exchange is actively operating with ongoing improvements.> Monthly average exchange volume has exceeded $50 million, providing revenue streams and benefits for NEX holders.We appreciate your commitment to Nash and your valuable feedback. If you have further questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out at support@nash.io. We remain dedicated to delivering a secure and user-friendly experience for our users and community.ALAlvaro3 reviewsESUpdated Apr 16, 2024Publicidad engañosa, 0 fiabilidad / Misleading advertising, 0 reliabilityUpdate:First of all, say that they changed the conditions of the promotion when they decided to end it.With the new version, you must be an \"Eligible New Customer\", if they, under their \"sole discretion\" and without notice, decide that you are not eligible, you will not meet the conditions. That is, you will only comply with them if they decide that you comply with them, that is, no one because it is not convenient for them.Finally, reliability says a lot about the company, after the reviews that several affected users have written here, a magical shower of 5-star reviews of poor quality appeared.-----------------------------Se han negado a cumplir con una promoción de bienvenida a referidos aún habiendo cumplido con los términos de la promoción.Para tomar mis datos todo fue bien, para comprar crypto y cobrarte su comisión también, sin problemas. Pero a la hora de cumplir con la promoción, primero avisan que se demorarán con los pagos. A los días de repente te deja de funcionar el login en la plataforma, cosa que inspira muchísima seguridad. Semana después, te toca reinstalar la app para volver a tener acceso, pero te dicen que no pagarán la promo a algunos usuarios porque patata. Me parece inaceptable este tipo de comportamientos en cualquier plataforma. Si no tenéis fondos para dar a todos los nuevos registros, no hagáis la promoción. En Europa esto se llama publicidad engañosa y es tan ilegal como una estafa.Soy usuario habitual de varias plataformas de crypto, incluso he estado en algunas ponzi y al menos esas cumplen con sus nuevos usuarios.Nash debería reconsiderar su enfoque y tratar a sus nuevos clientes con mayor respeto y honestidad, si no puedes cumplir, no lo ofrezcas.----------------------------------They've refused to pay the referral welcome promotion even though I had complied with the terms of the promotion.To take my data everything went well, to buy crypto and charge you their commission too, without problems. But when it comes to paying for the promotion, they first warn that they will be late with payments. A few days later your login on the platform suddenly stops working, which inspires a lot of security. A week later, you have to reinstall the app to regain access, but they tell you that they will not pay the promo to some users because potato.I find this type of behavior unacceptable on any platform. If you don't have funds to pay the promo to all the new registrations, don't do the promotion. In Europe this is called false advertising and it's as illegal as a scam.I am a regular user of several crypto platforms, I have even been on some ponzis and at least those comply with their new users.Nash should reconsider his approach and treat his new clients with more respect and honesty, if you can't pay, don't offer it.Date of experience: April 07, 2024Reply from NashApr 10, 2024Hello Alvaro, thank you for participating in our referral campaign.

As an attorney, I can say that the Nash Exchange seems to me to be extremely committed to both technical safety and legal safety. Technical safety: the Nash Exchange is designed in a \"non-custodial\" manner, which removes the concerns I might have with other exchanges regarding a technical security breach, or a \"hack.\" Legal safety: I find additional comfort from the fact that the Nash exchange appears very committed to compliance with federal regulations such as the Banking Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering laws.Date of experience: June 19, 2020DUduke1 reviewNLApr 11, 2024Easy to use and safest way to store…Easy to use and safest way to store your crypto.Enables the user to hold your own keys and always compliant in a ever changing world.Date of experience: April 02, 2024PRPrabjot2 reviewsCAApr 7, 2022Grow your savings.Was super hesitant when my brother in law told me about Nash and how easy it would be to use.

Unlike traditional cryptocurrency exchanges that have control over your funds, Nash have created a non-custodial solution. Through this, they never have access to your funds. Yet, the exchange has functionality beyond that of a custodial exchange. Due to their innovation, Nash is faster than any other cryptocurrency exchange. Their innovation stems beyond these features. It extends to Multi-party Computation (MPC) keys to allow institutional and algorithmic traders access without counterparty risk, and numerous other advances that have not been achieved before. The team have a proven business and academic track record, and conduct themselves in a professional and approachable manner.Date of experience: June 19, 2020P M2 reviewsITMar 25, 2024What about promised and unpaid bonusesWhat about promised and unpaid bonuses?

If I could give them a 0 reveal that would be it...Date of experience: December 01, 2023BMBigss Meltss1 reviewUSSep 13, 2024Block Piggy shipping and if you have a current order that you’re having issues with go to Temu support and tell them and they should reimbursed youAfter reviewing all these threads about piggy shipping, I contacted Temu and told them I want my order canceled or I’ll never buy another product again from them and I buy a lot of clothes because I have a brand so we get blank hats and shirts from them and then put our Logo on the shirts and hats and socks. My fiancé had issues with Temu because she would always say I was crazy for ordering all that stuff, but I never had issues because it was always USPS Sending me my order.Last Week I ordered an outfit for this coming weekend. I’m going to a festival. Most Temu orders take 4 to 5 max six days. I’m on day 11 with Piggy shipping and I need to get the shirt so that we can make them up for the festival because I’m a vendor at this festival.I told them I will never buy another product from them and I will go to DHgate From now on, I will just have to order more due to their shipping taking 14 to 20 days but when you order from DK it always comes.The Temu support agent said what can we do to make this inconvenience go away for you so we can Keep you from going to DHGate.I said refund me my money and put a block in my profile for logistics on Peggy shipping. I don’t want them to ever send me anything. Before I could get a response from the support team, my Cash app went off for $295 and they reimbursed my order and they said that they are going to be dropping Piggy shipping due to the high volume of consumer complaints.So the moral of the story is contact temu Support directly.I also told Temu that I’m Going to contact the  BBB Due to the negligence of piggy shipping. And I was going to also send in all the reviews of their miss handle and non-shipments but just for your information everything says Temu so it looks like you guys are in bed together.As a business owner, you have to watch who you work with, especially when you’re an International company using multiple logistic for drop shipping.I truly think piggy is a fraud company that was able to wiggle their way in with Temu because they only do logistics for Temu. I can’t find them anywhere else so like I told Temu, you need to separate yourself from them because if you hang out with a thief, you label the thief even though you’re not in that category..Sooo contact TEMU support and don’t stop tell you get your money back IF YOU CURRENTLY HAVE A TEMU ACCOUNT, I WOULD GO TO YOUR CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND TELL THEM BLOCK PIGGY SHIPPING FOR ALL LOGISTICS. THAT WAY YOU WILL NEVER HAVE ANY ISSUES. I HOPE THIS WAS HELPFUL.Date of experience: September 12, 2024ADAndie Durbin3 reviewsUSJan 25, 2024Unprofessional and unreachableThey rang my doorbell and since I didn’t answer they returned my package back to China!!!!

My most recent shop had my preferred shopper passed over for a new shopper even though she was online when the order went out. Then when I called their customer service to complain about it, my account was cancelled. This company is using deceptive advertising as InstaCart doesn't use preferred shoppers.Date of experience: June 26, 2024AdvertisementShawn B.1 reviewUSJan 6, 2024Constantly running into issues where…Constantly running into issues where the order is never picked up/ delivered.   Also almost every other order, items are canceled even know backups are selected when out of stock.  Shippers ignore the text for additional replacement options.  Why do I have to keep paying tips and delivery for partial orders,  just so.i have to pay another company to finish the order.  They should be required to refund the fee if they cannof fulfill orders completely,  since their staff cannot properly do their job on a daily basis.  I'm so tired of how companies  an do whatever they want and steal your money, but it's a crime if anyone else does it.Date of experience: January 06, 2024Ashley Powell1 reviewUSAug 9, 2024Poor They are only getting one star because it’s what’s needed to write this review.  I made an $80 order at 9 am this morning with a delivery time of between 11-12, then got an update that it would be between 1-2, and just received another update that it would be between 3-4. This is unacceptable and uncalled for. Especially when I signed up to be a member, in which I will be cancelling the membership today. I call customer service twice and both times I’m told they are trying to find a shopper to accept the order, offers to accommodate me five dollars(who-hoo) on my $80 order for the inconvenience. I had someone sitting in just to be there to receive the delivery while I’m at work, I will NOT ever be using shipt again NOR will I ever recommend this app to the next person. Get it together shipt. Date of experience: August 08, 2024MOMicheal O1 reviewUSSep 22, 2024Shipt is a scam masquerading as a businessShipt has a \"buy one get one\" promotion. To order buy one get one, you have to order \"1\" and then they will bring \"2\" for the price of one. This is what Shipt said when we called earlier about the buy one get one not applying.So, the shopper shops and cannot be contacted, then brings 1/2 the items with some items that are not buy one-get one missing.My mom calls Shipt and they tell her that she needs to take a picture of every item BOGO and missing items. The problem is the website navigation is trash.She is still on the phone now, if they do not refund the money I will file a complaint with the State AG in Texas, after the second attempt to get the refund.Shipt is a terrible service that also cheated me before and gave me \"credit\" instead of a refund. They gave it to me in December and then it \"vanished.\" At that time I canceled and told my mom it was a trash-tier service.Now she understands and will cancel.  They claim they will refund it in 5-10 business days. Strange that Instacart and others can do it faster. What a scam.Date of experience: September 22, 2024Loreene Kemperman1 reviewUSJan 5, 2024Rescheduled deliveries multiple timesOut of my last 3 orders, 2 have been rescheduled for a later delivery time...the NEXT day!

First 3 weeks I was working for them I had nothing but issues with app.  (They have records of my phone calls).When app issues kept me from delivering on time.  Which gave me a low rating.  Not even 50 deliveries was done and they permanently banned me.  Date of experience: May 20, 2024BUBuddy1 reviewUSAug 25, 2024I was a Shipt ShopperI was a Shipt Shopper. They continuously made me late with their technical issues. I couldn’t get help by phone and when I did, they would just cancel my order meaning I’d wasted all that time shopping it. It could be a simple processing issue. I worked through storms, floods, store renovations, and they deactivated me for being late. After they made me late. They said orders were cancelled, they canceled them. When they deactivated me, they locked me out and left me with no records of earnings or even who tipped or how much from the night before. It’s unethical and disrespectful. Bad Business. You should partner with a company that will value your time and service.It’s sad because for the most part, the customers were amazing. Most of them were kind, grateful and generous. However, to Shipt, you are not a person, you are not a business, you are a statistic in the algorithm. And if you upset the algorithm, you’re out. No matter the circumstances, they won’t accept any responsibility. And after deactivation, they even hung up on me.Date of experience: August 03, 2024Chris G1 reviewUSJan 1, 2024This service is garbageThis service is garbage. Don't waste your money on a membership. Unlike other sefvices, they don't provide any incentives to ensure your order gets delivered and they don't let you tip upfront to encourage delivery. FOUR hours after placing the order, still no one on it. Called Shipt who just said, nothing we can do. Wasted my time sitting hef waiting for it, plus now have to figure out dinner without it. Waste of money and uncaring company that doesn't deserve to profit from you.Date of experience: December 30, 2023Shelby Dodd1 reviewUSMar 31, 2024Shoppers not available They don’t let you know if shoppers might not be available when they take your order.

It was supposed to be \"same day\". They failed at that. Now they say \"within the next couple days\". I tried to cancel and do store delivery. They won't let me cancel saying it's already been picked up at the warehouse by SHIPT. But SHIPT doesn't acknowledge that and won't give me any information other than \"next couple days\" on the WEB site which will be 3 days from the \"same day delivery\" originally promised. Horrible service!Date of experience: February 20, 2024CWCatherine Whalen5 reviewsUSJun 18, 2024Cancelling my membership. After using Shipt for my company for two years, I got a new corporate credit card with a new expiration date and CVC. Suddenly I was getting error messages from Shipt saying that the \"CVC was invalid\". It wasn't. The transactions would show up at the bank as \"pending\", so it was not a bank issue.For some reason. on the back payment end of Shipt new card expiry was not matching with the CVC. I spent 5 hours on the phone with Shipt over 2 days. \"you should just use another card\" was the best that they could come up with.  I'm cancelling my membership and never using again. What a shame that they can't get their technology to take my companies thousands and thousands of dollars in orders.

I ordered from target and the shopper was horrible. Not only did they fail to communicate with me, but they dropped off the wrong order all together. I tried contacting the shopper by text and phone to no available. Then I call customer service and the first person was nice but refused to help. Then I call again and the second guy is not helpful and keeps putting me on hold. When the shopper finally gets back to me she tells me that she is sorry but will not be fixing the order before disconnecting from the chat.

I have never received any of them because I obviously do not tip enough. Each one has been canceled by their hotline out of India calling me on constantly changing numbers because my phone keeps wanting to block and report them as spam so they probably have to change their number a lot. But you pick a hour window for them to deliver and at the very tail end of each attempt at the last four or so minutes, even though the store shows the items were packaged and picked up by the shipt shopper, the hq people call and say the shopper could not find the items do I want a substitute instead. I say no and they cancel the order. I have attempted four times and each time the store says they gathered the items, packaged the items, and the items were picked up by the shipt person. The hq person each time says that I should see about rethinking my tip to the person due to the trouble of having to go through extra steps to finding substitutes. Yeah no thanks. I already tipped on top of a store delivery fee that paid the people to process and set up the order for pick up that states the shipt person picked it up.  So I'm done attempting. Super shady that each attempt has gone the same exact way. Makes it feel like they are purposely holding my package hostage to get a higher tip for the shipt person.

They refuse to even answer my question “are there shoppers available in my area or not so I can make an informed decision about next steps with my order.Canceling my order will result in 24-48 business hours before the $250 is returned to my account.

I wound up having a Shipt rep arrange to send me the Target receipt so I could give the tip (didn't want the shopper to suffer because of Shipt's policies) and I cancelled my subscription.

You need to fire everyone above a basic shopper and start anew.Date of experience: January 02, 2024Abriana Brooks1 reviewUSJan 3, 2024This was the worst experienceThis was the worst experience. Ordering something at 6pm but not getting it until almost 12am. The driver was not the best with communication. Why is my shopper pushing closing time before they are shopping? This doesn’t give enough time to actually accommodate the customer needs. On top of that , I was under the impression that multiple items were picked up. Only 1 item was delivered to me. Never again will I do this. We might as well go back to shopping for ourselves no matter the circumstances. This was such an inconvenience and waste of my time & night.Date of experience: January 02, 2024Taylor Wagner1 reviewUSJan 27, 2024Liars and poor payThey pay their shoppers the same amount doordashers make but 100X the work. As a customer, I can hardly get a shopper most days. They also promised free memberships to shoppers for life but they have now changed the regulations that you must be an active shopper and this is *subject to change*. Well it wasn't  *subject to change* when I was given my free membership after being a shopper for years at the height of Covid.

This company is the worst by far that I've worked with. I wake up to my account being deactivated with no reason other than I dropped an order, twice! Twice! I had over $300 for two days work. When I asked if I was going to get my money owed, they said they could no longer speak to me and hung up. I can't believe this. I would avoid this company as a shopper and a customer. This one lady wanted a compact mirror and instead the app had me scan a full length. Whenever I had an issue with an order they were nice and helpful. But now that they were petty over two order cancellations and deactivated me, with money in the app, I get no response but rudeness. Even being polite to them as they hung up in my face! This company is a sinking ship. I've got to see about the wages Im owed. There definitely going to have a class action lawsuit on their hands because this isn't the first time this has happened. Definitely won't be the last.Date of experience: August 12, 2024Jeremiah Amughmun1 reviewUSJan 14, 2024I was grocery shopping on the Target…I was grocery shopping on the Target app as usual. This time instead of choosing the pickup option I chose delivery because the expected delivery time was before dinner.24 hours later I still don’t have the groceries to feed my family. Since then I’ve learned that Target uses a 3rd party delivery company called SHIPT which has horrible customer service and is holding my groceries hostage. I can’t change the method from delivery to pick up and SHIPT says they can hold my order in perpetuity or until I cancel the order and wait 3-5 business days for the grocery money to be refunded.

Customer service could care less.Date of experience: January 09, 2024Ms. H1 reviewUSSep 30, 2024*Warning*Warning: Avoid This Company as a Driver*I strongly advise against signing up as a driver with this company due to their exploitative practices. They offer low rates, bundle deals that compromise pay, and unfairly penalize drivers for circumstances beyond their control.Specific issues include:- Low compensation rates- Bundled deals with unrealistic expectations- Unfair late penalties, even for circumstances beyond drivers' control- Biased review system- Arbitrary account suspension without clear explanation- Blocking of contact numbers, preventing resolutionMy personal experience:- Completed 55 orders with consistent star rating, yet faced permanent suspension. At 50 orders your rating is supposed to start over. However that never happened for me.- Received vague email citing lateness and star ratings as reasons- No opportunity for dispute or clarification. Only a form stating you can dispute just so they can tell you they are upholding their decision. That you still have no idea of what the reason is. Because you can’t speak to an actual human being.This company's practices are deceitful and exploitative. I urge caution and encourage others who have experienced similar issues to share their stories. Considering a class action lawsuit to hold this company accountable for their fraudulent actions.*Protect yourself:* Don't compromise your financial stability by working with this company. Explore alternative opportunities that prioritize fairness and transparency.Date of experience: September 12, 2024s polley1 reviewUSDec 13, 2023Shipt ScamThere is a current scam that Shipt has not yet addressed. A shopper charges my card for the amount of the order and indicates they have purchased the items, then does not deliver any groceries. They must be buying other items and pretending they are shopping to steal. I am done with Shipt now as a result. We are otherwise heavy users - twice weekly. This is the third time it has happened. Usually only occurs for an order over $100.Date of experience: December 12, 2023AdvertisementMary Sullivan1 reviewUSJul 8, 2024This company over books.This company over books.They will keep moving our delivery time, til they find a driver to claim your order.

Order Monday, expected Tuesday, nothing, closed shop and left, I thought well things happens will get it Wednesday. Then at around 7:20 PM get a phone call from the delivery person at Ship it and asked if we are open, told hel no and gave her our business hours. Ship it decided not to deliver it and return it to Best Buy. My problem is Shipt got the item before 6 PM could have call me earlier and I could probably make arrangments to drop next door business. Bad since now my option with Best Buy is to pick it up or do Office Depot that is closer. Very bad customer service-communications from Shipt, for Best Buy, go back to UPS.Date of experience: January 30, 2024Justin H1 reviewUSJan 18, 2024The driver lied and told me it was my problem, he and shipt cost me my package.The package was attempted to be delivered on Sunday rather than Monday.  The delivery location was to a UPS store P.O. box.  The store was closed and the driver was informed when he text me that the location was closed.  He told me it was my problem and the package was left.  So if that is true at best case he left a package outside a closed UPS store in the middle of a shopping center which was completely illogical.  At worst case he stole my package.  I will avoid anything delivered by the company, and stop ordering from any businesses using them to deliver.Date of experience: January 14, 2024DRDrew1 reviewUSNov 26, 2023Have drivers who don’t care about the…Have drivers who don’t care about the service or accuracy of orders.

SpeedX is not helpful and extremely unprofessional. They do not respond to your messages, ends the chat without notice, and makes it seem like they delivered your package but did not. They said that if you’re missing your package, to contact the seller, but the seller would tell you to contact the carrier. The only person being affected is the buyer and it is absolutely frustrating and time consuming to try to resolve this issue. To be more specific: I placed an order that would have arrived in TWO packages. One package has 2 items and another SEPARATE package has 4 items. I received ONE package with two items and am still missing 4 items. SpeedX sent photos stating that they made the delivery, which is why they can’t do anything about it. However, I have tried to clearly state that I was to receive TWO packages and their picture only shows ONE. They will make it seem like they did not do anything wrong. The policies between the carrier and the seller are contradicting. SpeedX will tell you to go back to the seller to request a refund so they don’t have to take the blame/fault, while the seller will tell you to go to the carrier to inquire about the package. It’s quite absurd that their horrible reviews go years back and they’re still as horrible as ever. I have ready many people complain across various platforms. I’m surprised there isn’t a class action lawsuit by now. Date of experience: October 27, 2024aundrea holland2 reviewsUSOct 21, 2024Terrible shipping companyTerrible shipping company.

Every time I’ve been anticipating a package, I get a notification that the delivery attempt failed and I have an “invalid address”. I’ve again, never experience any other issue with packages being delivered. I even left clear instructions on how to deliver my package, like you would explain to a 5-year old. I really think they aren’t even trying to deliver and instead just leaving it for the next person. I’m on attempt number 4, weeks later, and just not even expecting my package at this point.

It was delivered just now, everything here and arrived in good condition. Thankfully my roommate was home to grab the package. My first time ever hearing of Speed X and apparently it’s for good reason. I bought stuff on SHEIN and when they said my stuff shipped I went to check the tracking and it was through Speed X. A few days later it’s stuck in tracking saying it’s in a distribution center in Cali. Then yesterday (10/12) I get a notification that it’s out for delivery at 3:29pm. I wait and wait. And still nothing today. It’s been 24 hours since it said it was out for delivery. Based upon seeing reviews, I’m not hopeful my package will arrive. Both SHEINs tracking and Speed X tracking say different delivery dates but they both say out for delivery as well. Communication is horrible, and I never was able to get a straight answer on where my package was.

After Yami contacted them, SpeedX immediately updated to \"out for delivery within 2 days\". Sure enough, my Yami package arrived in perfect condition with nothing missing at 3 PM on day 2.

Terrible shipping carrier.  My package from SHEIN showed arriving at their warehouse on 9/12/24 and no further updates.  I called them to only be told by an automated machine that I have to email/open a service ticket with them online.  Opened a ticket and received an AI response telling me it arrived and would be delivered in 1-2 days from when it arrived.  It was already 8 days since it arrived!  When I responded to their automated response, didn't receive a response.  Sent 2 more follow ups with no response to date.  It's been 18 days.  My package was clearly stolen.  The worst customer service (or lack thereof) I have ever experienced.  I will make clear instructions to anyone I order from, they cannot use SpeedX or I will not place the order.

Their delivery team consistently leaves packages in inappropriate locations. Two months ago, I had a package worth $200 delivered, and because it was left in an unsecured area, it was stolen. I immediately reached out to their customer service team to address the issue and ensure it didn’t happen again. Unfortunately, no one has responded to me, even after all this time. This lack of response is not only disappointing but also highly disrespectful.Date of experience: August 21, 2024JOJo1 reviewUSUpdated Oct 15, 2024how about delivering to the right town?Two packages delivered to my building, neither for me. One was for someone on a different street in a different town! The other was for a different business in a different building at my address - the driver had to walk by the sign pointing to the correct building to deliver to the wrong one. And both packages were \"delivered\" by being left on top of a 6' electrical box mounted to the outside of the building. One package was completely waterlogged from rain (and the kicker is - the business it should have gone to was probably OPEN when they delivered to my electrical box instead of their door - they are a tattoo studio and were there most of the day on both Saturday and Sunday). And no response after over 30 hours to the ticket I opened on their website letting them know they needed to pick up the package delivered to the wrong town except an automated reply when I opened the ticket - though someone was very quick to ask me for tracking numbers about an hour after I posted this review (which I've now updated), to confirm I was talking about real packages.

They clearly stole my package. I was at home and heard some movements at the front door so I proceeded to then check but nothing. Literally as I sat back down I received a text message from speedx stating that a package was delivered with a photo of the front door and the package on the floor. So obviously now I am clearly confused because I am home on leave since I am heavily pregnant. No package just a bunch of stolen items with hard earned money. Extremely disappointing because there is no way to actually contact them other than a bunch of robots but it seems this is their practice. I will also be leaving a negative review with the company I purchased with as it seems this has been an ongoing stream of negative comments about the delivery practice of the company they continue to use who continue to steal from their customers. Also, the neighbors have a ring door bell camera pointed at the unit and they sent me the proof of the driver walking away with the package!

This company is the definition of incompetence and poor service. I’ve been trying to resolve a basic address correction on my USPTO document for over a month, and despite countless emails, phone calls, and chats, they have done absolutely nothing to fix the problem.They keep making empty promises and pushing me around with zero accountability. Their support team is either incompetent or simply doesn’t care about their customers. I’ve been left chasing them for weeks, and all I’ve gotten is a bunch of excuses and delays. Meanwhile, the deadline for my document is fast approaching, and they are putting my entire trademark application at serious risk.What’s worse, Swyftlegal’s idea of “customer service” is to redirect you to a third party who’s just as useless! They have wasted my time, my money, and my patience. They are quick to take your payment, but when it comes to actually delivering on what you paid for, they are nowhere to be found.This company is an absolute disaster. If you want a service that actually delivers what it promises, do not touch Swyftlegal with a ten-foot pole. They have proven themselves to be completely unprofessional, unreliable, and utterly incapable of handling even the simplest of requests.Save yourself the headache and find a real legal service — Swyftlegal is a total waste of time and money.Date of experience: October 02, 2024Reply from Swyft FilingsOct 2, 2024Hi there,Please be informed that Swyft Filings and Swyft Legal are separate entities.

Charged an additional $99/ year for reporting that they only completed once which allowed my business registration to expire. Never received invoices for either the quarterly or annual expenses.Date of experience: July 16, 2024Reply from Swyft FilingsJul 18, 2024Hi Matthew!We were able to research your account further and find that the subscription for the Registered Agent has always been set at a quarterly rate charging originally on January 6, 2022 and every three months from there. This was agreed to when the order was placed and we have not changed the frequency since filing your business! While we do hold the right in our Terms of Service to change a subscription price at any time, we give our customers a heads up if this is the case so that they are aware. For the $99 subscription selected during the checkout process, this was paying for the Annual Compliance Filing. In order for Swyft Filings to complete this service, we notify our customers via email and via their online portal that they must log in, complete the questionnaire to confirm their business information and make any state fee payments before we are able to proceed with the filing. Because this was not completed, we were unable to file on your behalf. A supervisor will reach out to you to clarify any further concerns or questions.CUcustomer1 reviewUSMay 15, 2024VerifiedSwyft Filing was quick easy and…Swyft Filing was quick easy and thorough, and their support staff was very helpful.

I paid extra for expedited incorporation service.  Because I needed the company urgently.I've called Swyft before about a different matter, and felt that they were pressuring for \"increasing customer billables\".  You will see what I mean when you go thru the painful process of incorporating and get hit with add-on after add-on (at increasing price).For this expedited filing, after waiting three months, nothing was done and I hired someone else who got me what I needed in just days.When I contacted them for a refund, and after getting approval for the refund by email, they insisted on speaking to me.  Ok, that's a nuisance, but whatever.  In speaking to their customer service rep, they took the position that \"Well, just because you never got anything, doesn't mean that we didn't do the service.\"  Wait, what?  I wasn't paying for effort, I was paying for a filing.  Hey, if it got rejected, that's totally different - but nothing actually got to the state to file.After agreeing to give me a refund, they said \"you are now going to be blocked from using our services.\"  Ummm, ok!Date of experience: September 04, 2024Reply from Swyft FilingsSep 5, 2024Hi there,We would love to take a further look into your account but were unable to locate your order with the information provided.

The timeline chosen for filing was expedited internally with our document specialists and it was submitted to the state within six business days. This timeline does not include the amount of time it takes for the Secretary of State to approve your business filing and send it back to us for upload to your account. While we understand expectations were for the entire application to be approved within six business days, it was disclosed during the checkout process that the timeframe did not include the state approval. We also took the time to offer an expedited option with the state before submitting which was declined by the account holder.

This company is a sham. After almost a full-year of my account being closed I received an email they attempted to pull funds from my account ($100). Why is my information still even in their system? Instead of cleaning this up on the backend, they are insisting I log in to my closed account to stop receiving marketing emails... a $100 pull from my closed account is not marketing, it's fraud. Do not do business with this horrible company. I barely leave reviews, but actually tell people starting a business to AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Date of experience: March 04, 2024Reply from Swyft FilingsMar 6, 2024Hi there,Thank you for your feedback so that we can take a closer look into your account. It looks like the order for your DBA was left as active and there were next steps needed for Swyft Filings to proceed. This means that all subscriptions selected during the checkout process also remained active. A supervisor will go ahead and reach out to you to resolve your concerns and ensure that we do not charge you for any services that are unwanted. Because you have indicated that you were unaware that your original order for the DBA was still active, we will go ahead and verify with you for cancellation.Read 3 more reviews about Swyft FilingsOi Pizdets Novosti2 reviewsUSApr 15, 2024Became a bunch of greedy crooks !!Became a bunch of greedy crooks !!Twice in one order they charged my card without authorization !!Twice had to waste time calling for a refund !!

Paid the $279 for the most inclusive package, and specifically the fast filing speed. Just found out that my application had been rejected because of a missing signature, and I had specifically gotten on the phone with them at least 3 times to make sure that THAT specific signature was, in fact, in their possession. After verifying that they had everything they needed every single time I got off the phone with them, my application still ended up rejected because of THAT page. My application was rejected, reissued just a few days ago, and I had no idea about any of this.

They mishandled my application for 503c status and tried to blame me for it. After I pointed out their mistake, they refunded my money. They don't provide any guidance, ensuring they get paid regardless. Regarding my agent of service, I closed this account a year ago and wasn't informed that I needed to remove them. Naturally, they attempted to charged my card anyway. I quickly figured out what was needed and resolved it myself, but once again, they didn't take any responsibility and left me inconvenienced.Response the answer: Let me clarify, you filed a nonsensical EZ form to the IRS for my 503c and after waiting for a year, (and you guys listed as my \"Agent\" of service) I was told by the IRS that I never responded to a letter from them for more information as the form made no sense. Due to this I  was denied and had to start all over. Your firm returned my funds because you submitted a form on my behalf without me ever seeing this form prior to your sending it. Had you given it to me for review, the information you compiled due to the lack of even caring about my business to learn what I do, would have been caught and corrected. I have waisted years with this firm at the detriment to my business and livelihood.Date of experience: July 22, 2024Reply from Swyft FilingsJul 24, 2024Hi Riley,From the previous review written, we responded with the following:\"Thank you for choosing Swyft Filings to handle your 501c(3) application! It looks like there were multiple email correspondences from us to your email on file explaining what was to happen next once the application was filed to the IRS by us. In these correspondences, our 501c(3) specialist noted to be on the lookout for a letter from the IRS indicating that additional information might be needed. This email also indicated that the letter received needed to be sent to us immediately so we can respond accordingly on your behalf. Unfortunately, because that letter was not relayed to us, the IRS determined the application would need to be submitted altogether. We do not ask for our filing fee again, but the IRS fee is non-refundable, so that would need to be paid again.\"Regarding the registered agent subscription, as long as the agent serving your business is LegalCorp Solutions, the card on file will be charged until this is changed or resigned. It looks like the business owner resigned LegalCorp Solutions on 7/23/2024 and we cancelled the subscription immediately after seeing this change. We will have a supervisor reach out to you again to ensure there is an understanding of what is happening with your account and help out with any questions pertaining to services that you may have selected during the checkout process.Read 1 more review about Swyft FilingsLCLinda Castillo2 reviewsUSMay 23, 2024VerifiedThe lady was so helpful and politeThe lady was so helpful and polite.

Veho is the worst delivery service that there is. It’s not worth using them. They couldn’t deliver my order to my door after getting Tovala meals for 11 months!!! I finally reached out to my vendor and they switched me to FedEx. Thanks Tovala!! Avoid Veho at all costs, you will be very disappointed if you do.It’s not that I didn’t reach out to their customer service either, they work off a script and send you to “managers” and they don’t help you either!If enough of us complain to the shipper, Veho will have to toe the line or go out of business. Date of experience: April 30, 2024ANAnon1 reviewUSMay 31, 2024Ignore delivery instructions and Insecure Customer ServiceThe driver ignored not only clearly written instructions on the address label but a big sign on the door for where to deliver packages to avoid theft. The customer service is such a joke it’s insulting to the intelligence of customers. Their only contact is a random text that somehow can’t look up your package with both an order and tracking number, but insists you text your full name and address AS WELL AS a tracking number to some random text. They then argue with you and try to trick you into sharing personal identifying information. What kind of shipping service cannot look up your order with a tracking AND order number? If I can look up my own address and order and a photo of my house that way, it’s absurd they cannot do the same. It’s not that difficult to set up a functional and secure customer service, no excuse for not doing better. Companies - avoid Veho unless you want to put both your products and customers at risk.

They returned my package to the warehouse and reported to me and the company who sent the package that they attempted delivery this morning. They did not. I finally talked to customer service and found out the driver was in an accident yesterday and returned the items to the warehouse yesterday. The report of an attempted delivery this morning was to take the blame off of them for not delivering and making it look like it was my fault. This is not ok!! I am ok with a late delivery. I am not ok with lying to try to change blame.

I only gave them 1 extra star since they at least respond. But they text you saying your package will arrive at a certain time frame on a certain day and if we need to change delivery instructions to respond to the text. I don't need to change often but sometimes I do. I live in a big city and I can't have packages left outside my door when I am not home. I will text them to please change the del address or day and they fully break down. Even though they act like they can in their texts. They contradict themselves every time I speak to them. They say they can't predict delivery time but they send a text with a delivery time. They said they can change the address / del instructions but then they say they can't. They will be the reason I probably cancel my HelloFresh subscriptions. Such a headache.

So now I am paying the regular rate, which I didn’t want to do until I had a better sense of the food.Date of experience: May 10, 2022Kira Cole1 reviewUSSep 25, 2023Veho is worthy of 0 starsVeho is worthy of 0 stars. On two occasions, they failed to deliver my Green Chef to me, costing my family our weekly groceries. The first time, they said there was an issue with the delivery van, only after they falsely reported the package delivered. They later admitted the package was never delivered, and rather than take accountability for that failure, they kept waffling and saying, \"It might still be delivered,\" which was not at all descriptive nor helpful when dealing with a box of perishable items.On the second occasion, they delivered the package to a different address. They sent me a picture and said, \"Delivered!\" only for me to realize the photo was not my home (nor did I have any clue where it was). When I told them the package was not delivered, they said they couldn't do anything about it and told me to get it myself.Inept drivers, terrible customer service.Date of experience: September 25, 2023LSL.

The gig-based economy has entered its end-stage where they don't even pretend to provide actual service or care about customer experience. A series of inaccurate texts regarding my delivery from Veho started my terrible journey, followed by some of the most flip and canned responses to my growing concerns about my delivery. They seemed more focused on getting me to download their app onto my phone. When my glasses from Warby Parker were ready, they sat \"waiting for pickup\" for three full business days before some contracted worker from Veho picked up my glasses. Then it was another three days of being told \"your glasses are arriving today,\" even including a delivery time range that came and went without delivery. My wife and I stayed home at various time to receive the package based on these messages. It was finally delivered at 8pm in the evenin g on a night when we received NO MESSAGE that the package would be delivered then. No driver accountability. No company accountability. 0 stars.Date of experience: September 25, 2023Jolene Loos1 reviewUSOct 28, 2023They delivered my package to the wrong…They delivered my package to the wrong address.

No delivery vehicle came on my street at the time my Vitacost package was \"Delivered\".Date of experience: May 20, 2023Jeff R1 reviewUSApr 15, 2024Veho delivered our HelloFresh meals for…Veho delivered our HelloFresh meals for about a year with about 80% accuracy. We even switched delivery days to avoid this service only to be moved back to them a few months later. The final straw and reason I am writing this review was when they sent a photo of our package delivered to the wrong address. Nothing serious, Veho screws up all the time. However this time, after letting Veho know, their driving came to my door, rang the doorbell, and accosted me for the box I never received. He asked me \"Where is it?\" as if it had been delivered and I took it in and lied.I told him I never received it but he did not buy it. Luckily I walked to the door without any tools, but this was not wise of him and I advised Veho the same. Knowing the track record and the fact that I would have seen the package, photo or not, I am appalled at his effort. He rang the doorbell twice, something they have never done upon delivering a package, interesting. They clearly don't have the most robust hiring process here. HelloFresh and brands also lost me as a customer because of Veho and they are aware. Date of experience: April 15, 2024:)2 reviewsUSJul 11, 2024You'll get your packageRemember! Only angry customers write reviews lol! I placed an order from LuluLemon and have never heard of Veho. Veho hires ordinary people to deliver packages similar to DoorDash and UberEats. I saw all the negative reviews and got so scared that I would never see my package. We got hit by a hurricane and obviously my shipment was delayed but then rescheduled once more, so that fueled my anxiety about my package. When I got the email that my package was delivered, I RAN outside because of all the reviews talking about drivers dumping them somewhere else or never delivering. But I did get my package; driver was even kind enough to put it on my porch chair and not the floor; and nothing was missing. I only took one star off because the company should be aware of the mistrust consumers have with them and maybe update their app to be a bit more open with communication. FedEx and UPS let us know if they're running late and Veho should too. I also did not receive any sort of notification that my package was out for delivery from the Veho app or Lululemon and it would be nice just in case there were any issues. Other than that- if you're like me who placed an order and have never heard of Veho- you're in good hands. The same way we put trust in our food deliver drivers, we should put our trust in Veho drivers. It's a job like any other and they have a responsibility to deliver a package safely and face consequences if not. At least with Veho we don't have to tip LOL.

They were shipped using Veho, a company I had never heard of.  I received a notification that my package was delivered.  However, it was nowhere to be found.  I contacted the company and was informed that the package was delivered to the wrong address and it was unretrievable!  They basically suggested that I attempt to retrieve the package myself and gave me the address of where it was supposedly delivered.  When I investigated, the address was incorrect.  The level of incompetence and poor customer service demonstrated by this company is truly deplorable!  They even sent me a picture of their delivery driver handing the package to someone at a house that is not mine.

I was supposed to receive my order between 2:00 PM and 5:30 PM on Tues.  When they were several hours late, I contacted the shipping company, Veho, and asked if my order would be delivered that night.  They responded that it would, and the delivery window changed to 9 PM.  When they missed that delivery window again, the track package feature of the Veho app indicated it would be delivered the next morning.  I would have been okay with that, but when I woke up the next day, I rechecked the track package and saw that they tried to deliver at 1:00 AM and said they could not enter the complex.  If they had buzzed my apt, I would have let them in, but they made no significant attempt to contact anyone.  It was a box of prepared meals that was in the delivery.  At this point, it has been days without refrigeration in S FL.  It is not safe to eat.  As I write this, I am still waiting, and now it is supposed to arrive between 10:00 PM and 2:00 AM.Date of experience: November 22, 2023Joseph Cohen1 reviewUSMar 10, 2023Worst delivery company ever!!!Worst delivery company ever!!!Driver came to my office after business hours, called me to advise me that she would not come back the next day during business hours.

Their system wasn't updated until this morning and it says \"Our order has been returned to a Veho warehouse after a delivery attempt. This may be due to access issues at your address. We recommend that you contact Veho Customer Support at 68953. Your delivery may be attempted again today or tomorrow.\"They did NOT attempt delivery yesterday, and there is NO problem accessing my single family home in a standard neighborhood where I've lived for 25 years.Furthermore, in order to contact them you have to download an APP, NO THANKS! I followed the instructions and sent a TEXT to report the issue and never heard back.THEN, I called the company I ordered from and was told the items were damaged in shipping and were beinbg returned to the company.So they lie to the customer about the real reason my shipment was delayed. I would NEVER do business with Veho directly and I wish Vitacost would find another shipper.Date of experience: June 24, 2023JSJames Seals18 reviewsUSSep 5, 2023If I could give them a 0 I would. Where do I begin. I’ve been using Factor 75 for my meal prep (great food), but they use Veho as their delivery service (awful company). 1. For the past 2 weeks my meals have been delivered to a completely different address. They never call (text based only company). I left instructions for them to call if they needed help locating my address (no call was ever made). When they sent a picture of the delivery and I instantly message them back saying the delivery was to the TOTALLY WRONG BUILDING, they did nothing.2. Their customer service is text based only. They have no phone number to speak with a human and their text based customer service reps really don’t give a damn about your delivery.3. When asked to transfer the chat to a supervisor, they will claim that there isn’t one available and will contact you as soon as one is available. I’ve been waiting for a supervisor for 7 days now.If you’re buying something from a company and they use Veho for the delivery, I would suggest finding the product from another company. Veho is unreliable, you’ll never get you package and their customer service is beyond terrible.Beware of this company.Date of experience: September 05, 2023KSKim Scheitler4 reviewsUSOct 10, 2023Says package from Saks was deliveredSays package from Saks was delivered, but was not delivered.

I live in an apartment building (one building only), consistently it is left in random hallways, outside of neighbors doors, in the lobby, in the wrong mail area, etc. It has even been delivered to a completely wrong address and they sent me a picture (of the wrong place) to \"prove\" it was at my apartment. The customer service is appalling, they openly share private customer information and have done literally nothing to resolve this issue I have been having for over a year. I will be canceling all of my services that use Veho as a delivery partner because at this point it is far more stressful to wonder if my order will ever arrive than it is to just find a different supplier.Date of experience: June 13, 2023TETell_It_Straight2 reviewsUSMar 24, 2024BEWARE! VEHO IS A SCAM DELIVERY SERVICE!I have had several (4) bad experiences with the shipper, VEHO. I have had problems from not receiving my packages at all (2 times-apparent driver/employee THEFT) to them leaving packages under the mailbox by the street rather than delivering to the door (1 time) and once a package was left in my front yard (but at least I got it!). You can’t call anyone as there is no phone number available. Customer service was contacted through e-mail, but there is nothing they can do except apologize and make excuses. The tracking states things like “lost package” or “delivered to wrong address”, but with further investigation was found to be untrue. It is likely DRIVER/EMPLOYEE THEFT. This is the scummiest shipper I’ve ever dealt with. Big retailers like Saks Off 5th, Nordstrom Rack and Nordstrom (amongst many others, sadly) use them, but they are losing my business if they use this shipper. I will not be doing any more shopping with any retailer that uses this horrible company for their shipping method.

Customer service is terrible and I will never order from a company who uses this delivery partner again.Date of experience: December 28, 2023JEJoscelyn EdD3 reviewsUSMar 11, 2024This is the worst company everThis is the worst company ever. Every package that has been 'delivered' by this company has been misdelivered. I am not sure if their drivers are illiterate or lazy or a combination.Yesterday, I got a notification that my package was delivered by Veho. They sent a picture of a hallway of the apartment complex I live in. I live in an apartment in the downtown area of my city. This apartment complex has six buildings and four floors to each building.How am I supposed to know what floor the package was delivered on? And why didn't the driver deliver the package to my door? Before you say, 'Maybe your apartment number was not on the address', it is. My address is correct as I have been living here for a year and I verified they have my correct building and door number. The driver for whatever strange reason decided to pick a spot to put my package and took a picture of one of the hallways here and it wasn't even my hallway because my doormat is not in the picture. Where do they get these people and is there training provided? The absolute worst. So, now I have to wait 7 days and contact the company that I made the purchase from just to say, I don't have my package and then wait another 5 to 7 days to get my refund.I wish when I am ordering, I can select what company to deliver my order. It definitely would not be Veho.Date of experience: March 10, 2024Jamie Darling1 reviewUSMay 9, 2024I wouldn’t even give them 1 star the…I wouldn’t even give them 1 star the driver backed into my post light destroying it and drove off as my father watched her do it I contacted the company and since I don’t have it on video they won’t do anything about her destroying my property Date of experience: May 08, 2024Danielle Pinsly1 reviewUSDec 13, 2023My package is lostMy package is lost.

Even though APC said they cannot track my parcel in it's destination country, after spending A LOT of time I managed to finally do it myself using the USPS number only to find that the parcel arrived here and WAS sent back.

APC's job was to get the package from the US to Germany.Their first scan happened on April 30th without any info regarding pickup from/handover by the seller whatsoever. It took them until May 14th to get the package to the international distribution center. At some point, it was handed over to another carrier, Jersey Post, who seemingly was responsible for getting it across the pond. The package arrived in Germany two days later, then was procesed by the customs authorities. All in all, it took 40 days for the package to arrive - the slowest shipping from the US to manland Europe I've ever personally experienced, including peak pandemic months and non-airmail shipping.Since it took them so long, I figured that the package must have passed lots of hands and was worried about the item's condition upon arrival. To my surprise, both the outer packaging and the item itself were in absolutely flawless condition.Personally, I'd choose reliabilty and careful handling over speed any day, so my overall experience was positive. If time is of the essence, however, you should probably avoid buying from sellers working with APC.As for their tracking, it's, ahem, minimalistic... Certainly an area that needs improvement. Just let the recipient know where their package is going to be processed next and when that is likely to happen.

The experience I have received from having to contact APC's customer service team has made me change my mind on using the company I was receiving a delivery from which is really sad as it is not the companies fault.If your order goes missing or in this case dumped any where without your notice, they do not care you will have to call and e-mail several time to chase them up about it and you will NOT be receiving your parcel or any help regarding it.Unprofessional delivery team and customer service, horrible people and horrible experience!!!Date of experience: January 15, 2021AdvertisementDADano2 reviewsUSMay 5, 2023One word for this so called companyOne word for this so called company  SCAM!!!!!!

This morning I received a shipping confirmation for a package and I let out a large groan when I saw it was being shipped through APC.Previously, I ordered something through an artist store on March 31st. The artist's team shipped it out April 3rd and I thought I would have it in maybe 3-4 weeks due to the coronavirus which isn't that bad. I have ordered many things since mid-March (when COVID-19 began to hit NA) and all come to me within 3ish weeks depending on customs (no fault of Canada Post or USPS). APC is a different story. They took the parcel which was all fine until it began to sit. and sit. and sit. It sat at Chicago O'Hare for 4 weeks and finally my next tracking scan came to tell me that it moved into USPS custody AT CHICAGO O'HARE. How does it take FOUR WEEKS to move a package across AN AIRPORT. I understand with social distancing measures, there will be a backlog, but this makes me wonder, what is normal movement time? Is it normal to take say 1 week for a package to move across an airport? Probably not.Thankfully, I did end up receiving my shipment on May 18th (a total of 6 weeks compared to what customer service quoted me as 7-10 business days) and everything was fine within the package HOWEVER, delivery was done by USPS and Canada Post, NOT APC which means they get NO props as they barely did their job.If you see someone shipping via APC... please ask them to get a new postal company.Date of experience: June 16, 2020Jeremy Howell22 reviewsGBApr 15, 2024Unbelievably slowUnbelievably slow.

They have delayed and lost my international shipments, been rude and unhelpful in customer service communications, and are by far the worst I’ve experienced when it comes to ETAs.I wish Printify and their print providers would recognize just how much of a negative impact Asendia has on the entire customer experience and cut ties with them. Everything else about my POD business works seamlessly, but as soon as Asendia is in the mix, it has been a bad experience 10/10 times.Date of experience: August 01, 2024DADerek and Jane Sparrow20 reviewsGBOct 18, 2023Asendia USA falsely claims to have delivered parcel to me!!Asendia USA: EEUS004926939GB0Received a very fancy-looking email today, saying, \"how wonderful, your package has been delivered\".I look at the tracking information, that tells me the exact moment at which it was delivered: 5.43pmI was in, and no package was delivered.

ASENDIA has now lost 7 packages (out of 9) with value over $2000USD. eBay corporate is now aware and a full investigation is pending for their criminal actions.They are stealing packages that they perceive as having value, or not bothering to ship at all, so they can still get paid, then sell the items at auction. They have an F on BBB; any positive reviews you see here are fake.The bad reviews are 100% correct. Asendia has lost many of my packages, most recently a valuable and massive 80lb box. Their 800 number goes to a blank voicemail box 24/7 - there is massive corporate or employee theft occurring. They have lost all Etsy & eBay shipments in the last 40-60 days; confirmed with well over a dozen merchants. This company is a criminal enterprise and NOT a logistics partner.

Normally urban outfitters ships with this service in Canada and every single time i've order something that could break it has come COMPLETELY broken. This time I had bought something from american eagle and when I saw the delivery service I immediately started getting ready to be frustrated and annoyed.. thankfully it was only clothes. The delivery driver dropped it off at 10:30pm and in front of my garage door. Thankfully I found it early in the morning before my family ran it over as no delivery driver was ever stupid enough to leave it in such an inconvenient spot COMPLETELY visible from the road.Date of experience: December 05, 2023MAMaria1 reviewCZAug 1, 2024Horrible company, no customer support Horrible company.

Now i’m here reading the comments and i’m pretty sure i will never get my package. I never seen a delivery service with such bad ratings and who are unable to deliver international package when it’s in fact its own purpose. And i’m receiving stuff from the US every week. First time i see this company and im so sad and angry the seller chose to use it. We’re on holiday so i bey a lot of package goes missing. Tracking is LS430276795CH if anyone here from your company care to help me.Date of experience: December 13, 2023Reply from AsendiaJan 3, 2024Hi Axel,On rare occasions parcels can be delayed or misrouted and we are sorry for when this is the case and for any inconvenience caused. If your order has received a Delivered scan I would advise contacting the final mile courier as they will provide the most recent information in regards to the location of Delivery.Thank you for contacting Asendia and have a pleasant day.TRTim R2 reviewsCAApr 30, 2024AVOID ASENDIA & UNIUNIAVOID ASENDIA! Asendia has the worst customer service of any carrier company. I had a package that was supposed to be delivered by them. It is now 15 days past the expected delivery date. They do not answer the phone. I put in a request to call me and they instead send me an email that only contains the tracking number (which I already had). Finally, I spoke with Sarah, from their customer care team. Turns out they subcontracted their serivce out to a different carrier (UniUni, also horrible). After 2 hours on hold, UniUni hang up on me. Sarah promised to call UniUni and call me back. She has not called me back. How can you run a company like this? Date of experience: April 29, 2024AdvertisementDODominic1 reviewCADec 19, 2023Something really fishy about this…Something really fishy about this company. So many packages are disappearing, tracking that seems to stall. In my case my package from MeUndies was received and processed by the Los Angeles facility on November 24 and then again on November 29, December 1st, 3rd then the 14th and the 16th. It is now December 19th and it has still NOT left that same initial facility. I really hope that companies switch shipping services because I personally would not be ordering from MeUndies again because of this issue. Or that Ascendia gets organized and finally offers a professional service because from what I’ve seen, the reviews are atrocious.Date of experience: December 19, 2023PBPaula Bain4 reviewsUSUpdated Jun 19, 2024This is no way to run a business!If I could rate lower than one star, I would. There was a delivery reported for me today. Strange thing is, there was NO delivery. Checked the order and saw the photos. The number on the house where the delivery was made is 66, on what street I have no idea. Needless to say the number on my house is nowhere near that...and in a totally different neighbourhood.

Does not deliver!This company is dishonest and unreliable. They do not attempt delivery! We have had companies use this good for nothing shipping service and BOTH  times they say “attempted delivery.” Guess what people have cameras! It forces people to be honest. What they do is they go straight to the nearest post office to THEM and drop it off. The company also has zero customer service. Have fun trying to get a hold of this place to let them know what their drivers are doing. It’s an answering machine and they do not call you back. I no longer will purchase or deal with anybody that uses this no name horrendous “shipping” company.Date of experience: December 11, 2023Reply from AsendiaDec 20, 2023Hello,We are very sorry to hear you are frustrated and would like to try to help.

Means in a few days, it will be a month without any updates! I asked for answers, becuase I NEED my stuff and they seriously told me to check the tracking link.. I mean wow, thank you Dr. Obvious, it's not like I do this on a daily base?! At least give me a realistic delivery schedule or tell me what's the problem, so that I at least know what I'm about, ffs !! Now I had to re-order my working materials elswhere now, which of course costs me a big freakin' bucket of coins, but hey, who cares..? Asendia certainly doesn't.

Not sure if it has to do with the volume of parcels around this season, but considering that about a month ago it took only a week for it to arrive to me from the US, it's just wildly inconsistent.Date of experience: November 30, 2023IEI. Ehimua1 reviewUSJan 5, 2024Fraudulent Company!I live in NYC and ordered an item from the UK on Amazon in late December 2023.  The UK vendor decided to use this company Asendia which I've never heard of and I was given a delivery date and a tracking number.  I got notifications from Amazon that the package is in transit but when I placed the Asendia tracking into the Asendia portal the number was no good.  I tried it again but to no avail. A few days pass and then on January 3rd I got a notification that the package has been delivered to my address but I never received it. The package was never delivered!  This company Asendia is a sham just like that other shipping company Lasership.  These companies need to be brought to the attention of the State attorney General for fraud and theft of services.Date of experience: January 03, 2024Previous156770Next pageCompany activitySee allClaimed profileReplied to 76% of negative reviewsReplies to negative reviews in < 1 weekAdvertisementAbout AsendiaInformation written by the companyNEED HELP WITH YOUR PARCEL?\nIn most instances you will need to contact the retailer you shopped with to raise your delivery query or complaint and find out how they can help you.

From start to finish, their service left much to be desired, and I would strongly advise against using them.First and foremost, the delivery was significantly delayed. Despite the promised delivery timeline, my package arrived days later than expected, causing inconvenience and frustration on my end. The lack of transparency and communication throughout the process was astonishing. I had to constantly reach out to their customer service team for updates, only to be met with vague and unhelpful responses.Adding insult to injury, their customer service was unresponsive during business hours. It goes to voicemail. When I attempted to address the issues by email, I was met with indifference and a lack of accountability. It was evident that they did not value their customers' concerns or take responsibility for their subpar service.In conclusion, my experience with Flashbox was nothing short of a nightmare. From the delayed delivery to the damaged package and the dismissive customer service, they demonstrated a complete lack of professionalism and commitment to customer satisfaction. I would strongly advise against entrusting them with any delivery needs, as they are clearly incapable of providing a reliable and satisfactory service. 2 weeks later and still no package!!!Date of experience: July 03, 2023Previous13459Next pageCompany activitySee allClaimed profileHasn’t replied to negative reviewsAdvertisementAbout FlashBoxInformation written by the companyFlashBox offers a true one-stop solution for all your last-mile delivery needs.

I sent a 30kg suitcase for shipping. Not only did my suitcase arrive late but it was absolutely destroyed! 27kgs of my personal belongings are missing!!! I also found someone else’s underwear in what was left when the bag arrived!!! When I raised this with GLS they said they could not locate my things in their warehouse. CCTV camera showed my suitcase arriving in the original condition into their warehouse and leaving destroyed! Someone in the GLS Dublin warehouse has clearly broke into the suitcase stole my belongings and taped the bag up! The suitcase had a zipped compartment where most of the items were packed. This was also fully opened and all the stuff was gone.This is absolutely unacceptable and they are not even taking my claim seriously. I’m extremely upset as most of my items can’t be replaced and to see that they are only willing to give me €200 for all the damage and 27kg of missing items is disgusting. Can’t be trusted at all.Date of experience: April 22, 2021TOTom116 reviewsUSUpdated Jun 21, 2022Two weeks and no delivery yet...A letter with documents was shipped to the Azores (Portugal) from Italy on the 3rd of June 2022 and on the 9-JUN-2022 it ended up in a parcel center in Funchal, Madeira island, Portugal (wrong location, thousands km from the destination) and it's been stuck in it now for 8 days, while GLS website states the following:\"Sending parcels reliablyReliable parcel delivery within defined standard delivery times is the strong point of GLS. Domestic parcels usually reach their destination in less than 24 hours. In Europe delivery times are generally between 24 and 96 hours.\"Now it's been 2 weeks since my shipment was dispatched from Italy and I demand a refund of the shipping charges and initiate a claim for a lost parcel.The above statement by GLS seems like a far stretched statement or like a joke.Here's what GLS has to say:\"GLS has the largest logistics transport network in Europe. Due to this factor, our shipments can be delivered to the main European markets in normal times of 24 to 48 hours. If you usually ship internationally to more distant countries, the estimated delivery is from 1 to 7 days, depending on the country.\"Did GLS lose my parcel?

This is totally unacceptable.Today they said someone will pick them up from 9 to 12, no one came.Then they told me someone will come till 1pm, no one came.Now I should wait until 3pm, let's see if I will manage to send my clothes back to my place or if I will leave them in a different country.Date of experience: October 22, 2021VPVirgilio Pereira6 reviewsGBJan 25, 2022BRISTOL DEPOT A BUNCH OF LIERS SACK THEM ALLI am waiting for a parcel since the 5th and on the 25th still no parcel.YOU ARE A DISGRACE AND SHOULD BE TERMINATEDBRISTOL DEPOT A BUNCH OF INCOMPETENT LIERS SACK THEM ALL.Date of experience: January 25, 2022DVDimitri Vincke10 reviewsBEOct 19, 2023Very bad service.They send you a message not being home, and send it imidiatly to a pick up point... in the pickup point the delivery got stolen cause they let the people search their package out of a pile of shippings.

The shipment was from Los Angeles area to San Francisco Bay Area that is a 6 hour drive. The package was received a day late and took ~40 hours to be delivered.   GLS promised an email investigation response in 2 hours after complaint made for shipment delay on their chat.   They FAILED to provide an email response and FAILED to deliver the package on scheduled delivery date.  After 3 hours, I followed up and was told the package was not lost.   GLS called the next morning and told me that the package was received a half hour earlier and was out for delivery by 5PM.  They could not explain what happened in the previous 30 hours.  Response to not giving priority to late packages was the shipper did not pay for the service.  Told there was no direct line if the delivery failed.  Their Chat on their website took multiple tries to get in the queue. No concept of good customer service demonstrated by GLS-US.  GLS demonstrated poor logistical capability with this  experience.  If you own a business, please do NOT use GLS-US for shipments.Date of experience: July 30, 2021KIKim2 reviewsSESep 10, 2024Deliveried to a parcel office 200km from where I live!They sent my eBay bought item to a parcel office in a city 200km away from where I live....Date of experience: September 10, 2024FHFrau H2 reviewsDENov 3, 2022worst delivery performanceThe Status shows: parcel delivered, but I didn't receive anything although I was at home.

I have never received the parcels at my address. I am talking about 4 parcels, not one. I live in a famous french village and GLS fails continuously, forcing me to drive for many kilometers at my expenses after chasing their useless and arrogant support. My suspicion is that there is a corporate guideline specifying NOT do deliver if this causes additional kilometers to be driven. Some time ago I went to a recovery point to chase my parcel (40 km  away from my home where GLS delivers parcels that were not capable of delivering) and the responsible person simply told me that GLS DUMPS packages there without even attempting delivery. This is, to my knowledge, a full contract violation and the management is for sure aware of this and likely driving this as a strategy and company culture. This is the best case potential root cause for GLS failure because, if not, then GLS has ZERO knowledge about their duties, quality and client satisfaction thus posing a risk for their clients.Try to stay away from them, especially if you can, i.e. you're the parcel sender,not the recipient who has to suffer ...Date of experience: September 10, 2022Dee Dee1 reviewUSSep 22, 2023was suppose to get next day shippingwas suppose to get next day shipping, I placed an order on the 12th of September and today is the 22nd of September and still no package.Date of experience: September 22, 2023Islam Muhammad4 reviewsDENov 9, 2022They deserve a rating of ZeroIf there is a zero rating I would give it to the. miserable company that you must not trust.

One time a Nordstrom package actually arrived on my porch at 10 o’clock at night, and the box was open and the contents were halfway out of the box.

Ordered something from Nordstrom Rack. Anticipated delivery date came and went. Reached out to LSO to find out what was going on, as the status indicated that my package was sitting in my city’s warehouse. They responded and essentially told me that yes, my package had arrived, and they’d deliver it whenever. But to keep in mind that they don’t have a turnaround time. Which is absolutely absurd to me but I digress. Reached back out to Nordstrom to let them know the situation and they told me I could file a missing package report for a refund a few days later if I never received it.

I knew this company had to be trash after tracking an order, that’s still hasn’t arrived, for days since last week when the status was out for delivery. On top of that I’m waiting for two separate orders from FashionNova that are all being shipped by LSO. This may be my last order from FashionNova if they are incapable of proving a shipping company that can deliver. Companies are going to lose customers if they continue using cheap and unreliable 3 party shipping companies like LSO.Date of experience: June 05, 2023Alex Morgan1 reviewUSUpdated May 26, 2023Why can’t we give zero stars?

I placed a order through a merchant that uses LSO as a shipping vendor and my package said Door, not able to locate , my address was correct on the package no reason why they did not deliver only because they are lazy... the next day the tracking updated to out for delivery so I waited and surely the driver pulled into my driveway rolled the window down and threw the package out of the car window landing in front of my garage. I was furious and told them they should have got out to place my at the door.

They delivered my package to wrong address. Which was delivered in another city. They do not take ownership for delivering to wring address. Even showing then the invoices showing the email on file to deliver to, they still claim they deliver to correct address and will not do anything to fix it.  They are  giving out people addresses. They gave the the address to the home where my package was delivered, which is a big hippa violation.

I’ve been dealing with “lost” packages for years because the companies I purchase from choose to use LSO. The only thing I can do about that is to stop ordering from Nordstrom and the others until they finally get it together and start using a legitimate shipping company. Not worth the hassle, definitely don’t trust LSO or the companies that continue to use them, and really disappointed that every single experience with them has been just as bad as the last.Date of experience: June 01, 2023marquisha jiles1 reviewUSJan 11, 2024If I can put NO STARS I WILLIf I can put NO STARS I WILL !

Watching the tracking on my package reminds me of playing pinball, but a lot less fun. It’s “out for delivery”, but then no, it moves farther away. Then, instead of going to the residential address, it seems to have gone to some business that was “closed”, and had “no access”. I alerted them to the error and resent them the address (even though the address they already had was correct). I even sent them a photo of the house. I’ve also sent them a Google Maps link to the exact location. Several days later, still nothing.The company’s email responses are formulaic assurances that my inquiry is “under research” and will receive the “highest priority”. Very clearly, the customer service rep has a readily available collection of stock replies tailored to increasingly irate inquiries. But, equally clearly, no action is ever actually taken. So yeah, I’ve pretty much given up hope that the package will arrive in my lifetime. Deliveries really don’t get much simpler than this one, folks, and they still can’t manage it.Date of experience: March 14, 2024AdvertisementRachael Vaughan1 reviewUSApr 28, 2023Never got my orderI ordered somethings from temu and my order was moving pretty fast until it got to the states and LSO took over.

Both dates have come and gone with no package. On 12/4, I contacted Nordstrom regarding the package I was expecting on 11/29, and just so happened to screenshot the tracking information. Funny how I went to LSO’s website to see if there had been any movement  and it was updated to say delivered 12/1 at 12:00pm. Weird, it didn’t say that on 12/4! The 12/4 package is still MIA, but I’m sure that’ll get a fake delivery date as well. People need to keep screen shots of this crap because I could've been responsible for hundreds of dollars worth of “delivered” merchandise that I didn’t actually receive. That is truly alarming. Are they processing so many shipments stuff is falling through the cracks, or is there some kind of fraud/theft occurring? Truly seems odd to me that out of nowhere there is updated tracking on a package that’s already been reported as missing.Date of experience: December 13, 2023JVJorge Vargas2 reviewsUSAug 23, 2023This company lets their drivers mark…This company lets their drivers mark packages as delivered when they actually never deliver the package.

I’ve ordered from Fashion Nova twice and for some reason they keep using this incompetent company as a delivery service. The first time I ordered my package never came and then it was updated as lost even I tracked it. This time my package was suppose to be delivered on August 20th. It’s now August 23rd and tracking still says it was scanned at a center in my city 3 days ago. Any company that is using LSO delivery will not receive my business because they are unreliable.

They either fail to update their tracking, constantly change the delivery date, even if you paid for expedited shipping, or they straight up deliver your package to the wrong address, which is my latest issue. My saving grace was the driver taking a picture of my package at the wrong address, even though it shows delivered at the correct address. It’s terrifying knowing that their drivers failed to verify basic information or at the least use GPS. That’s incompetence for no reason, and now I have to wait for LSO to figure out what they’re gonna do next. I bet they save companies a ton of money as their delivery service, but terrible experiences over and over, will make a loyal customer jump ship.Date of experience: August 14, 2023Gavin Enriquez2 reviewsUSApr 22, 2023Really Terrible ServiceI ordered something through Temu that originally said it was shipping through USPS, but eventually got picked up through LSO. I received a notification saying my package was delivered, but it wouldn't tell me where. I couldn't find it in my mailbox, outside my home, and none of my neighbors said they have it. I tried to contact them during their business hours multiple times and each time I called it said they weren't taking calls. Which honestly baffles me as I've never had that happen before with other shipping companies. I've encountered automatic response systems and long hold times, but never a company tell me they aren't taking calls during a week day. I had to get it reshipped and refunded since some of the items I bought are out of stock now. If I ever see another package shipped through this company again, I might just call the seller and get that changed as soon as possible.Date of experience: April 17, 2023Jaylee Brown1 reviewUSFeb 28, 2024This company is beyond trashThis company is beyond trash, they told me they were unable to deliver my package due to “unable to access” after I gave very very specific instruction's.

Which they backdated a day once I called Nordstrom to inquire about the packages whereabouts. It was never delivered. Just lost or stolen. All LSO companies phone numbers are out of service. You can look up up some of the upper management contact info in the internet. So maybe I'll try them. But seems like the company is on its last leg. Needs to go. If you are a company.

I provided my cell phone# and email address with the order, but no one has tried to contact me. If the problem is that they need the gate code, why would they come back a 2nd time without contacting me? The gate is still going to be there.

They are incompetent and unreliable with what they are open to do which is deliver packages. I have had them unfortunately as my carrier 5 times and 3 of those times I didn’t receive my package. They fraudulently sign your package and mark it delivered. It’s so shameful that companies are still using LSO. You would think that the seller would be losing out on money for having to refund customers and losing the product. I’m wondering does the seller file insurance claims on lost goods and get a nice lump sum from it? It has to be something in it for them to use a company that is clearly fraudulent. It’s no secret and its not hard to find reviews on how sh@@ty this company is. I have completely stopped ordering from places when I find out LSO is being used and before I order from new places I will email or call customer service before I spend money with them.

My tracking has not been updated for days, there’s no way to contact them and my package is missing after 4 days of an estimated delivery date, finally it reads delivered and I don’t have my package. I contacted the company which this should not be a surprise to them as I have read many reviews stating that they are victims also from ordering from this company. I am going on vacation with the things I ordered which makes me very upset. It’s sad that these billion dollar companies go through these type of carriers after so many complaints of theft. The company has lost out on a customer, and LSO should be put out business, ITS RIDICULOUS l!Date of experience: July 13, 2023Tiffany Travis1 reviewUSFeb 9, 2024Why would the driver deliver the…Why would the driver deliver the package to the front of  the leasing office.

Hasn’t moved since. I have tried contacting the company multiple time with no response. I contacted BBB and the company responded through them with an apology about the issue. They said they would get back with me. I kept responding I don’t accept the response. The BBB has closed the case saying the customer (me) was not satisfied. I still don’t know what happened to my package. I don’t know if it’s lost or sitting in a warehouse. I just wish the company would at least give me a response.

It took two weeks for the tracking number to be active in the system. It is now at a facility 100 miles from my house in York PA. The notification says it left the facility on Dec 30 and the USPS is waiting for said package. It feels like \"left the facility\" means they put it on the truck and parked it in the parking lot.I see many reviews with similar complaints posted last year. I saw only one positive review of OSM by \"Person Human.\" That looks like a fraudulent review to me.Date of experience: January 03, 2024Joshua Kastenberg1 reviewUSNov 7, 2023OSM is Irresponsible…OSM has picked up two items from retailers and failed to move them to the USPS in a timely manner.  Apparently they let shipping items linger in their saddle brook NJ place for days if not weeks.  There are no updates that they post and seem to have no accountability.  Although I dont want to blame the retailers who post on ETSY, they are going for the cheapest route and collecting money for expedited shipments.  This company is a jokeDate of experience: November 07, 2023SESeth2 reviewsUSAug 9, 2022Ignorant movementThese guys just leave your package hanging at oddball places.

Walking your package to its desired destination would be so much faster than turning it over to this horribly mismanaged company!!!  They claim they handed off my package to USPS.  Apparently this is the line of bull they tell everyone whose package they lost.  USPS has checked everywhere for my package and they never received it from OSM.  Only use OSM if you enjoy playing Russian roulette with your package!!!  😡😡😡Date of experience: August 18, 2022PFPeter Furlong1 reviewUSDec 8, 2023OSM is GarbageThis company is so incredibly slow it’s pathetic.

I ordered a book for school. It has been sitting in the same location for over a week now!

In ALL of my past experinces, when I get a package that ships from Cali it's delivered in about 2 - 3 days tops. However, with OSM it took a FULL 10 DAYS to reach me. For some godforsaken reason the package went from Cali, to Nevada, and then all the way down to the southern tip of Texas?!? before being brought back up to Colorado. IDK if this was put on the wrong truck in Nevada by mistake or what, but this is absolutely ridiculous. This company is completely incompetent and should NOT be used by businesses.Date of experience: January 30, 2024Raul Rey1 reviewUSMay 26, 2023Horrible company who's policy seems to…Horrible company who's policy seems to be \"save a penny, even if the client has to wait forever\".I will make sure this is not the shipping company before buying anything online.After contacting them asking for a definitive delivery date:\"If you receive no further updates, the quickest way to resolve your inquiry is to contact the retailer and let them know you haven’t received your package.

One has been stuck in Aston, Pa. for DAYS! While the others have either been delivered or are moving in a normal amount of time. This is unacceptable since this one book is being delivered to an address in the SAME state! I fear I might not even get this book since so many others have complained that OSM tends take up to OVER A MONTH OR TWO to deliver in some cases, or worse, tends to abandon their cargo so USPS winds up destroying it or losing packages.Date of experience: January 22, 2024TPTiffany proctor1 reviewUSFeb 28, 2024I hate this shipping methodI hate this shipping method. My items get to my city but then they just sit and sit there for upwards of 5 days or more before finally being taken to my post office (5 miles away from the one where they sit and sit at) to be delivered. So the process takes 5+ days longer than it should because the packages just sit in my city and don’t move. Date of experience: February 01, 2024BRBrenG4 reviewsUSMay 24, 2023Slowest company everSlowest company ever.  WHYYYYY does it take to long to move your packages.

Terrible shipping service. Takes too much time. Package was shipped to me from 30 min away.(Moreno Valley) Took a week. Left California.

Honestly, I would Prefer to pay a little more for shipping and actually receive my package BEFORE the NEW YEAR ( order placed December 3).  I actually placed another order at the same time, which shipped from Australia, and it arrived in 4 days! This shipper, OMS WORLDWIDE, rates SLOWER than \"snail mail\". Once my package actually moves, and it moves S-L-O-W, to another destination  it just sits there for days.  This has been such a bad experience that if I ever see that They are the shipper (I will be sure to check) handling my order, I'll cancel my order.Date of experience: December 02, 2023Sarah McGilvary1 reviewUSJul 5, 2024If I could leave Zero starsIf I could leave Zero stars, I would.

A delivery date will be provided when USPS receives the package.\"    and \"Picked Up By Shipping Partner, USPS Awaiting Item  SECAUCUS, NJ 07094 June 19, 2024, 8:55 amShipping Partner: OSM WORLDWIDE\"  It is now 16 days (and a few hours) later, and tracking  has not changed.16 days and they haven't managed to get the package to the United States Post Office? The Seller would be better off WALKING to the nearest Post Office pulling a little red wagon with their packages.  OH, WAIT!  The USPS actually picks up packages!  With for real Postal Carriers!  And even if they stop for lunch, an mani/pedi, coffee and donuts, they manage to get packages to the Post Office in under 10 hours.  Lesson learned.  Never knowingly buying anything from any seller who uses this \"shipping partner\".  Ever.    I think I will share this review with the US Postal Inspector , Better Business Bureau, and Department of Professional Regulation in New Jersey.Date of experience: July 05, 2024Jack Daniels1 reviewUSSep 9, 2024Why can't I just pick it up myself...Package was supposed to be here 5 days at the latest.

I ordered a book on May 19, 2024 to be used in a class starting June 4, 2024.  The delivery date was to be between May 25 and May 30, 2024.  OSM Worldwide picked it up on May 20, 2024 but then gave it a joy ride to who knows where before it arrived at their shipping facility in Glendale Heights IL on May 29, 2024.  Then things got better or so it seemed.  It left Glendale Heights the next day.  It only took one more day for the book to arrive at the USPS Regional Facility in Kansas City KS on May 31, 2024 and then was transferred to Wichita KS later that same day.  Now however it has taken two days for the USPS to acknowledge receiving it and the latest from them is that the book will finally be delivered no later than 9:00 p.m. on June 5, 2024.Date of experience: June 02, 2024BCBrenda Collins1 reviewUSOct 19, 2022Worst Company Ever...Company should you UPS for deliveries.This is the second time a package that is in  Grand Prairie, Texas took weeks to deliver to my location (a 45 minute drive).  According to tracking information, my package arrived on October 5 at the facility during at 11:12 am and departed the shipping partner facility the same date at 7:13 p.m.  Today makes 13 days, I have been waiting for my package.  I have written the company, this is freakin unbelievable.  How can a company like this remain in business. I could have driven 50 plus times to Grand Prairie to pick up my package.  I order another package from the same company a week ago, and received it yesterday via regular mail.  Ugh!!Date of experience: October 17, 2022PCphil c1 reviewUSSep 28, 2023DO NOT USEI ordered a package through a reputable Resaler. they had said it would take 7-10 business days to be delivered. well we are coming up on 10 days and nothing. when I track the package the USPS states that it was picked up by OSM 8 days ago and hasn't moved since. when I reached out to OSM  I got a generic response and was given no help. if you see that OSM is going to handle your package request a different shipping method. A quick google search will reveal that OSM has a one star rating on every review platform and has nothing but negative reviews and horror stories.  If you are a business DO NOT WORK WITH OSM! It will negatively affect your business!Date of experience: September 28, 2023LALarry1 reviewUSMay 8, 2024This shipping company is wasteful and…This shipping company is wasteful and is moving packages all over for no reason but to up cost the freight. I had a package fly into NY, NY and then shipped to York, PA. I live in Hanover, PA 30 miles away. OSM decided to ship my package to Aston, PA which is 97 miles due East and above Philadelphia. When it re-ships, if it re-ships, the package will travel back through York to get to Hanover. If it needed to go to Aston, PA then why not from NY, NY as it was CLOSER.Date of experience: May 07, 2024M.M.P.3 reviewsUSMar 28, 2024Nonsensical delays!My current bad experience with OSM mirrors previous experiences.  I like to buy used books, and every time a seller uses OSM, it takes far longer than it does with USPS alone.  Currently, my book was picked up by OSM in Secaucus, NJ on 3/17 and arrived in York, PA on 3/25 (only 180 miles from Secaucus.)  Left York the next day; I have no idea where it is.  USPS has not yet received it; book is now officially late.  Why did it sit for a week? That's nonsense.  As I said, this is not the first time for such unexplainable delays by OSM.Date of experience: March 27, 2024Alan Harada1 reviewUSJun 22, 2023Ordered two shirts for fathers day…Ordered two shirts for fathers day gifts on the 6th.

Date of experience: July 04, 2024MJMark J9 reviewsCAMay 5, 2022HorribleHorrible.  I ordered two Blu Rays from Arrow video USA and they were coming to Canada.  They have been lost/stuck somewhere in my city for a week only to see they're now being returned to sender. The OSM tracking claims they have the wrong address but there was nothing wrong with my address.  This happened with two separate orders.  I was trying to support a small business with Arrow Video US but next time I'll stick to Amazon.  Arrow needs to use a new shipper before these clowns destroy their business with awful lost, delayed, excuses, excuses shipping. A garbage experience and a poor shipping company.  Please use USPS or Canada Post. They're way more reliable.Date of experience: May 05, 2022JVJohannes Versendaal1 reviewUSDec 14, 2022Very slow.Any company that uses this shipping method will lose their customers. Slowest delivery on the planet. It's been 10 days just to arrived at USPS distribution center in NJ with no delivery date to California with tracking number. I recommend not to use this transportation shipping company. If this is because of saving shipping cost it's not worth it.Their website is misleading they seem to be a brokerage company for shipping and not a shipper. I believe this is the reason for slow movement of parcels. USPS media mail is faster.Date of experience: December 14, 2022Nunjo Biznezz1 reviewUSDec 11, 2023Dumpster FireVery slow shipping. Never on time. Packages will stay at locations for days without updating. Packages get lost. Not trustworthy. Füm I’m talking to you.

What's just happened with an eBay purchase happened once before (with a different eBay merchant) . . . but since sellers don't disclose the shippers they use, we can't avoid making the same mistakes.  Like the earlier seller, this one uses  OSM Worldwide, a shipper that \"partners\" with USPS.  And, as before, it's taking OSM forever to get my small, inexpensive item into the hands of USPS.  I ordered on April 23rd.  USPS tracking site, per USPS tracking number provided by seller, shows item picked up by OSM the next day.  Here we are, 11 days later, and there's been no update at all to the tracking information.  (Item not yet given to USPS; item is still sitting who-knows-where.)I'm also giving a poor review to this merchant, for using OSM.  I doubt that sellers bother to read reviews of shippers, before picking the cheapest one . . . but if this seller, or any other, had bothered to look into OSM -- or cared about the many poor reviews THEY'VE gotten because they use OSM -- they would see the easy-to-find tons of negative OSM reviews on Google, Trustpilot, Yelp, and the Better Business Bureau (all of which cite the very same issues).Date of experience: April 23, 2024CACarla 7 reviewsUSMar 26, 2024My package has been sitting in two…My package has been sitting in two different facilities for a week.

Date of experience: March 26, 2024SUSusan2 reviewsUSJul 16, 2023I refuse to order from anyone who uses…I refuse to order from anyone who uses this BS company! I have to wonder how they continue to operate. My package has been sitting in North Las Vegas since the 6th. I've asked to get a refund, I no longer want the makeup I ordered. God knows where it's been sitting.Date of experience: July 15, 2023ADAdi2 reviewsUSJun 30, 2024Positive experiences with OSMLike many of the reviewers here, I’ve also had to rely on OSM inadvertently because of suppliers from Amazon using them to get the product shipped to USPS. My experience in these cases has been quite different from the majority of reviews below.My items have arrived on time and undamaged. I feel a lot of reviewers on here suffer from mismatched expectations. I usually seem to get OSM from suppliers, when I choose slower delivery alternatives. They don’t deliver super quick, but they deliver within the time they promised. Why does one feel the need to track one’s package every second or minute of the day? What’s the problem if your package sits in York for a week, if it still arrives on/around the expected date? When you text your wife sitting in the next room, that message first goes outside the earth’s orbit, gets bounced all around the world and then makes its way to the living room. Maybe some day we will start obsessing over the path of that message too. If you choose expedited delivery, and your supplier chooses to use a slower service, then the ball was dropped by that supplier, not by OSM. Without a clearer understanding of supply chain dynamics, and with unnatural / unhealthy expectations, it is easy to blame the messenger. My advice - lighten up. Most people who have positive experiences don’t come on here to post a review. I wanted to change that and provide some perspective. I’ve used OSM - again, inadvertently - many times over the past several years, and my experience with them isn’t any more incrementally positive or negative vs. other good suppliers. They generally meet, or as in my most recent case, exceed expectations.Date of experience: June 15, 2024SASalanan2 reviewsUSAug 20, 2023Horribly slow shipping companyHorribly slow shipping company. Took them 8 days to transfer my package to USPS. Their website says if you're package is stalled somewhere, contact the vendor, as if they're the ones with the package.

RDX was amazing in dealing with it, then they involved OSM. First replacement was lost in transit 4 hours after it was picked up in Texas, 9 days ago. My second set sent was picked up 4 days ago, and still has yet to hit the tracking service. I'm glad I don't use these for work at all, oh wait I'm a fight coach, I kinda do.Date of experience: August 01, 2022GLGerald Lander1 reviewUSJan 10, 2023Slowest possible company to ship…Slowest possible company to ship anything! My item sat for four days in one spot without moving. USPS would have been a major improvement. Almost two weeks to go from Georgia to New York. Still have not received my \" in shipment\" item. I would never recommend this \"shipping partner\". Just put a stamp on it and put it in the mailbox!Date of experience: January 09, 2023GSGary Smith1 reviewUSJan 6, 2024Can I give them a zero?If I could assign a zero to this company, I would. I placed an order with Daedalus Books that was processed on December 14 and turned over to OSM. As for January 6 it is still in limbo and I have no idea where it is. If Daedalus continues to use this company I will no longer do business with them, and that would end a relationship of over 20 years.Date of experience: December 14, 2023SHSherry6 reviewsUSFeb 3, 2024HorribleHorrible!

HorribleDate of experience: September 23, 2023NINot Impressed1 reviewUSNov 4, 2022If I could give negative stars I wouldIf I could give negative stars I would. The customer service rep was so rude, unprofessional and unacceptable. When inquiring about several packages that have been held up at their facility for almost a month, I was in shock in how this rep replied. I had previously spoken to USPS who said they had in no way received any packages from OSM. The rep flat out lied to me and blamed it on USPS and took no responsibility. Showed no empathy, and didn’t even bother to ask about the other three tracking numbers I had that were missing. How they are in business is beyond me. And the fact that this rep hung on me just goes to show the attitude and character of who OSM employees.  OSM, if this is how you treat your clients, shame on you! And to claim you are aware of your multitude of negative reviews and you still conduct business this way is just pathetic.Date of experience: November 04, 2022CUcustomer2 reviewsUSJan 14, 2024Been waiting a week plus for a package…Been waiting a week plus for a package to get handed off from this company to USPS. the facility it said it's at is literally an hour away from me/my post office. kinda ridiculousDate of experience: January 08, 2024PPPeter Park4 reviewsUSMay 29, 2023Slowest shipping companyI ordered an item from eBay, not knowing that the seller was going to use OSM Worldwide. My item was picked up by this company on 5/15 in Illinois. It took them 4 days to transport it to North Las Vegas, NV. From there, it took 6 more days to be delivered to my home in California on 5/25. So, in total it took them 10 days. Even if the seller had used the cheapest shipping option from USPS, it would have been much, much faster. Please do not use OSM Worldwide if you need to receive your item urgently. It's the slowest shipping company I've ever dealt with.Date of experience: May 15, 2023WAward1 reviewUSMay 14, 2022This company can not find their butt…This company can not find their butt from a hole in the ground, hell a I can take a camel or jack ass and do better and faster to California and back.

I sent 2 packages through eBay within the space of a week. The first package while dropped off at the hub location, was (and still hasn’t) been picked up because it “wasn’t ready” The subsequent package I dropped off after this, DID get picked up?! But they didn’t think to pickup the first package they have still failed to pickup. Lost for words how these guys are still operational. Have also lost two of my previous sales somewhere. Whether it’s sendle or Aramex the local contractor that’s at fault - the whole service is a joke. Not expecting any sort of compensation either Date of experience: April 15, 2024ELElizabeth7 reviewsAUMay 18, 2024This company is so hopeless, don't keep their wordThis company is so hopeless in their word. You place a booking & they don't show up. Then they have a hide to tell you that the item wasn't ready when it was. Gets re-booked again for the next working day plus they assure me it will be monitored for collection & again they don't turn up. I complain & then they state wow the area that I am in, is lacking their recourses when I am in a local area not far from their pickup points. So unhappy that I had to use another company & the job was done within one day from Sydney to QLD to their door. Date of experience: May 12, 2024Pi1 reviewCAJun 6, 2024Packages never picked up, falsified tracking remarks!Had 2 packages to be picked from Langley, BC. For 4 days, the packages were not picked up. Excuses that the drivers are busy or Sendle cannot get in touch with the franchisee (Yes, they have franchisees running packages). On top of the delay, the franchisee (I suppose) had the audacity to put a note on the tracking page saying the driver was there to pick up the package but the package was not available which is a white lie because the package was left outside, marked & labelled the night before. The company not only does'nt care about your delays but makes up false excuses. Also only webchat available for any follow-ups, no phone number. Finally cancelled my pickup and used another service. Never would I trust Sendle again.Date of experience: May 15, 2024RLRai Lee1 reviewAUMar 3, 2023So it seems like Sendle are pretty…So it seems like Sendle are pretty solid in the US, but have been giving Aussies the 'short end of the stick'Basically, I sold an item on ebay valued 75 dollars,The package (using the label they provided on ebay) never got scanned at the store which was stated to be a hub ON their site, using a label printed provided by ebay.Suffice to say, they refused to honour their compensation policy (can't link so please google).Date of experience: March 04, 2023AdvertisementJames Rogerson6 reviewsAUApr 26, 2024Sendle are of course extremely badSendle are of course extremely bad, and today I discovered why, in conversation with one of their agents. Sendle organises your delivery via a third party. But, here's the kicker: they have no idea who the third party that has your stuff is. That's why they don't provide any tracking: they simply have no idea who has got your parcel. eBay sellers need to stop using this awful service, and I need to be much smarter in spotting sellers who use them and simply not buying from them.Date of experience: April 26, 2024LWLuke Warm Water1 reviewUSDec 10, 2023UnsustainableUsed etsy for 1st time and thus my introduction to Sendle.

The Order from etsy and their twee but feckless hybrid delivery-style carrier Sendle posted as 2, yes a brace of opposing updates:  1.) sustainably lounging with their relay carrier on the East Coast and  2.) Delivered.  Neither etsy or We're-So-Sustainable-Our-Cheeks-Are-Green Sendle has been responsive.  My only comfort is that both etsy and Sendle have achieved total sustainableosity.  I hope they can take comfort in my credit card's force-stop charge-back.  That, I can assure, is sustainable.Date of experience: December 10, 2023Darek Dobrogowski1 reviewCASep 22, 2023Don't use Sendle if you are a Canadian…Don't use Sendle if you are a Canadian customer because they have double standards and will treat you worse then It's US customers. For example Sendle offers damage coverage for its US customers but not for Canadians. If your product gets damaged during shipping you get zero nada zilch. When my package was damaged they told me to package it better next time!The truth is Sendle has double standards: better for US clients and worse for Canadians.

I run a small business and have had several batches of parcels not being picked up for over 5 business days. I ended up needing to take them to Australia Post Office, in which, despite the higher cost for each parcel and time needed to go there, they are always reliable.The amount of time I have wasted bringing in the parcels in and out of our premises and time to chase up the pick up with Sendle is all money down the drain.They always reply with \"we are sorry and we will put a priority note on your parcels\" but after that 5 day wait. I honestly have no idea how they are able to gain trust with their customers. Definitely has lost mine.Date of experience: January 31, 2024AdvertisementCandace Fournier1 reviewCAJul 29, 2023Terrible ServiceI order tea from a Calgary based business and the promptly sent to out on July 14th. A few days later I got a notification that they are returning my package to sender because my address was wrong, it was not. I contacted Sendle immediately and the said that would contact the courier and get it re-routed. That did not happen and it’s been sitting in the sorting depot in Edmonton since the 20th. I have context them almost daily since the 20th and they keep saying it’s coming the next day and it never does. Absolutely ridiculous, I would not trust them with my packages.Date of experience: July 14, 2023GAGabby1 reviewAUJul 13, 2023Terrible ServiceI used Sendle for a few months to ship parcels for my small business. Over 15 of my packages had been lost in international transit with no parcels found and 0 compensation. Obviously this had a massive impact on my shop reviews as parcels were going missing and customers were getting angry. DO NOT use this service if you want a reliable provider.Date of experience: May 01, 2023RARachel1 reviewUSJun 6, 2024Parcel Claims is Violating & A NightmareIt’s really a disgusting policy that sendle requires a cost invoice from someone’s supplier to file a claim. It’s 300% none of sendles business what someone paid for their product they resold and who their supplier is: absolutely totally irrelevant to the entire claim - you strictly need to know what the customer paid so the customer can be reimbursed. That is it. I will be filing complaints and reviews in other ways until sendle redecides their policy. Highly unprofessional to require this, honestly I wish I knew about it before I chose sendle 3 years ago to start doing business with.Oh and that is on top of also requiring your banking information and routing number to receive potential compensation for the claim. Absolutely bewildering how a company has such privacy violating policies!!!Date of experience: June 04, 2024HOHO1 reviewCAMar 12, 2024Canadian sellers beware!!I would rate it less than one if I could. I think this is the second bad review I’ve ever written for a company because I would usually just let it go but their service is badddd! Warning all Canadian sellers, stay away from sendle.Pickups never actually when they say it does and they can keep rescheduling past 6 days as is my case. This actually happened before but against my better judgement, I used the company again.Also if you decide after waiting over a week for a pickup to just go drop it off, well, you can’t do that. You will have to void the label and buy a new one because pickup labels are apparently different than drop off ones? Either way, 6 days for a pickup is unacceptable and for it to happen twice makes me believe this is their usual way of working. For your own sanity, stay awayDate of experience: March 10, 2024AdvertisementASAngela Stewart1 reviewUSFeb 21, 2023InvitedExcellent serviceReceived 2 days sooner than expected, the package was in great condition, and they delivered it right to my front door.Date of experience: February 21, 2023BRBrendan1 reviewAUMar 22, 2023Unreliable, slow and loses your packages.I am totally fed up with Sendle after using it for 3 months for my small business. At least half of my online orders have had 2 week of delays in processing the pick up/delivery. Currently I've got a large order that is potentially lost after sitting at the hub collection for almost 2 weeks. It is not worth risking your new business' reputation using Sendle. It has been the most disappointing and frustrating experience ever and will be looking to switch to another delivery service.Date of experience: March 22, 2023RORob. 4 reviewsAUNov 18, 2023PATHETIC SERVICE!

Spoken to a few clowns there that just pay you off and tell you to wait longer because they use a third party courier! pain in the head these i d i  o t s are. Just can't seem to get anything out of these A holes. Do yourself a favour and use Australia post! These people suck for delivery times and their \" customer support\" which I believe employ a bunch of people that just don't care! I hate this company with a passion!! Worse than Aramex and they set the standard for pathetic. Seriously takes days to be picked up, days to be sorted and weeks to deliver and that's no joke I've had parcels arrive from UK and USA faster than these imbeciles deliver from one state to another in Australia!!

I have given them so many opportunities to show they have picked up their act but they don’t even supply scanners or anything that can print off a proof of drop off so when your parcel goes missing you haven’t a leg to stand on . Then when you complain they say they are investigating . The investigation never finishes , that’s because it never starts . They haven’t got one professional side of the business . I have no idea why the government hasn’t closed them down . There isn’t even a phone line to enquire or call . You get stuck with a robot going round and round in circles . It’s only a matter of time before they are held accountable for the appaulling service they charge for but not provide . I can’t give a single positive for sendle . I am not talking 1 bad experience . I’m saying 1 in 5 won’t end up at the address it’s meant to go to . Fair trading need to step in , perhaps they may be able to sort this shonky shipping company out before they send innocent business’s broke . Date of experience: June 08, 2024RORose7 reviewsAUMar 8, 2024Ebay sellers in Australia please do not…Ebay sellers in Australia please do not use Sendle. The problems are as follows:1. There is no phone number to call and request assistance. They must be the only courier in Australia without a phone number. 2. The real person takes over 20 minutes to respond on the chat bot. 3. If there is no where safe to leave the parcel when you are not home, there is no option for you to collect it from a collection point. I was advised in my area (inner city of a capital city) there were no collection points. They also cannot leave parcels at Australia Post, or any other collection point. 4. You cannot specify a time for delivery. 5. They hold parcels for 5 days before returning to the sender. 6. The re-delivery option via the dashboard on their website failed to have my parcel available for re-delivery.

Shipments usually arrive 2-3 business days from package pickup, overall the time from order to delivery usually takes only 3-4 business days and rarely longer (only twice it took longer than 3 business days and most of the time only took two business days. There rates are the cheapest - cheaper than direct carrier labels and an account is always free, so next time instead of ordering package shipment labels directly through the carrier (unless in special circumstances such as signature required or special insurance needed) it makes the most sense to create a free Sendle account and use Sendle ONLY for those packages.Date of experience: June 29, 2023Read 2 more reviews about SendleIJIan Jordan1 reviewAUDec 3, 2023Hello is there anybody there?Don’t waste your time there whole process is automated.You will end up talking to nobody but an automated process that goes no where does not answer any of your questions as in where is my lost parcel is it even lost and so on .Week 3 now and my birthday gift ordered has now come and past and still none the wiser as to where my package is .Rubbish service!!Date of experience: November 16, 2023KRKristi5 reviewsUSFeb 13, 2023InvitedWorked with me on size that I neededWorked with me on size that I needed, excellent with communication.

But now, after working with them for a while, I have to say I'm seriously bummed with their service, and I have to take back that five-star rating I gave them.My experience with BYRD went south real quick, and I think it's important to let others know, especially if they're thinking of using BYRD for their fulfillment needs. When I get some free time in the next few weeks, I'll write up a more detailed story about my experience and why I'm not a happy customer.For now, I just want to say to anyone looking for a solid fulfillment partner, be careful with BYRD and maybe check out some other options. I seriously regret going with them in the first place, and I hope my new review helps others make a more informed decision.---------------My old review----------------Among the many fulfilment service providers we contacted, BYRD stands out in many aspects such as UI, integration, customer support, documentations, and so on. We are happy that we chose BYRD as our partner. After signing the contract, we were able to get everything up and running in a very short time with the excellent support of Marc Klein, the onboarding manager.

We are a small but multi-local D2C skincare brand and looking for a fulfillment partner in continental Europe. We already operate in the US and based on a very competitive market experience over there, I was a bit skeptical how European players can match. But had a smooth exploration ride with Byrd - first meeting with Zuzanna Koczorowska, their passionately knowledgeable sales rep, and continued with Felicia Eriksson, Byrd's account executive with thoughtful, well prepared discussion. Eventhough us being a small brand and vendor, Felicia did her homework thoroughly and prepared a customized and detailed proposal for us to consider. I was impressed by her understanding of our situation and goals, and was able to draw a detailed picture of operating through Byrd's logistics centers throughout Europe. Eventhough we are quite early stage for such a comprehensive set of services they can offer, I had a feeling of care and full transparency. Because of Felicia's dedication and expertise, will definitely consider Byrd's proposal as we start growing in Europe.Date of experience: April 18, 2022Reply from byrdApr 21, 2022Thanks for the great feedback!

In summary, I lost a lot of money working with them. Here are a couple of points.Pros:1. The B2C deliveries were always on time and I had very few complaints. The packages were also good. Cons:1. The platform or SaaS solution is useless. For almost everything I had to go through the ticket system.2. I lost a lot of money because they are not able to properly do B2B deliveries. Clients buy for me in larger quantities, and it took MONTHS to deliver. I lost money, clients and reputation. 3. Same goes to FBA amazon. It took them so long to deliver, and made so many mistakes in between, that I have been out of stock in FBA on several occasions and also on high season days. 4. There is a complete disconnection between the warehouse and the customer service. This might seem trivial, but they cannot solve your warehouse problems at all. You have to escalate everything 100 times. 5. The turnover in personnel is absurd. I felt that every week I was talking to somebody else. I can show a lot more examples but is not worth it. I tried everything possible to make it work and also give them new opportunities to improve, but it is just a horrible service. There are better services out there. IBS, Zen Fulfillment, Everstox, etc.. Sorry, I believe these guys won`t be around for long.Date of experience: April 11, 2022Reply from byrdApr 21, 2022Hi Nicolas, Thanks for the honest feedback.

We're of course happy that the B2C fulfillment worked well for you, but want to understand the underlying issues that you raised.We would like to highlight two points though: 1, We have significantly improved and streamlined our B2B fulfillment processes over the last months2, The reason why you were talking to various people was that we have a large customer care team and when someone is on sick leave / on vacation, you will be assigned to our agentsI hope that we can get in touch to discuss the points you raised in more detail and wish you all the best!Advertisementessy manopla1 reviewATUpdated Jun 26, 2024Application Even though I was not the right fit for the Office Manager/HR Working Student position byrd made the application process straightforward, communicated the outcome clearly, and left the door open for future possibilities where my profile fits better.Date of experience: June 24, 2024Reply from byrdJun 26, 2024Thanks a lot for the positive feedback!

Their employee reaches out via cold emails and guesses directors email addresses which is a breach of GDPR as they’re personally identifiable emails. She then proceeds to send multiple follow up emails despite never requesting an email in the first place or even knowing who this company is. To top it off, she spelt my name wrong. Really unprofessional company and they clearly don’t know what they’re doing. Don’t work with these guys. Please look into your staff and how you guys try and acquire new clients.EDIT - please stop trying to get my review removed when we all know it’s 100% honest :) you also delete comments on Instagram because apparently they’re not “relevant” when they definitely are.Your response shows you take no responsibility for anything. I’m not sure why you have a problem with me mentioning your staffs name when this is public information.It takes a few seconds to check a spelling, especially when you’re harassing me out of the blue. It’s not difficult to at least double check. My name was not spelt incorrectly just once either. “Rishma” and my actual name is a big difference, it’s really not difficult at all. What a rubbish response - this is a major GDPR breach and you take no responsibility at all, shock. You cannot go around guessing people’s emails. We NEVER asked you to reach out to us once. We’ve never even heard of your company and we’re not surprised.Why should I have to respond to an email to get you to stop. Especially, when I didn’t even request your email in the first place. Who even sends follow ups again and again? Surely, me not replying to your first few emails should be a good indication that I’m not interested.  You really have no idea what you’re doing and it shows! Take some accountability and stop thinking you’re so self entitled.Date of experience: April 06, 2022Reply from byrdApr 7, 2022Thanks for sharing your honest feedback here! First of all we would like to emphasize that we did not try to get the review removed but wanted make sure that no personal information is displayed publicly.Of course, we are sorry to hear that you were dissatisfied with our communication. Moreover, having misspelled your name should not have happened. However, we're all humans and mistakes happen. We reached out to you in the first place since we thought that we could help you with your e-commerce logistics. You also definitely know that there are tools to \"guess\" the email addresses which are being used by sales teams all over the world. We also want to say, that having responded with a \"no\" or \"not interested\" would have prevented us from sending follow up emails.Thanks a lot for your understanding and we wish you all the best!JOJoshua1 reviewDEMay 24, 2023BYRD has been a great fulfillment…BYRD has been a great fulfillment partner for our company .

It's a real pleasure working with you!S(Stephanie (Delie) Kastner-Erol2 reviewsATUpdated Feb 16, 2024NOT A WAREHOUSE PARTNER!!We've been a client of Byrd Technologies since 2019. In the start of the summer of 2022, our team started to notice a lot of \"used\" items being inbounded under \"returns\", along with a lot of wrong/dirty items being being sent out to the customers. We sell swimwear & underwear and a printer cartridge was included in one of our customers packages for example, or a used bikini bottom would be shipped out, or a wrong bra would be shipped out, after a couple of weeks, our inbox was flooded with customer complaints, when we raised the issue with Byrd about the wrong items/dirty being sent, or the fact that most returns were being marked as \"used\" so we effectively couldn't refund our customers and needed them to double check if they were actually \"used, we were ignored for months, (there was no account manager since our last one left Byrd, after that, they told us we have no account manager). I lost a lot of customers and our reputation was damaged due to Byrd, due to this I was seeking a reimbursement for the damages. After 5 months and me following up on the claim, they finally offered 1,000 EUR for the damages. Summer is our peak season and the damage claim was about x10 higher than the offer, not to mention all the first time clients we lost in our peak season because of the mess, then I reached out to the manager of Byrd who onboarded our business back in 2019, only to be ignored and immediately passed onto their \"lawyer\", when I disputed the case with their lawyer, they sent a debt collector from Alter Law, with no acknowledgement of their wrong doing or my reimbursement claim. Their lawyer also ignores my emails for as long as possible. They simply don't care. Hardly surprising when I see their reviews here. It's been an appalling experience, ignored, gaslighted and then slapped with a mighty bill even though they owe use more than we owe them. Our case with Byrd is yet to be acknowledged and and our reimbursement claim resolved!Update: 16.02.24 - still not yet resolved, please contact  me through my website \"ESSENTIALS FOR ZULA\" if you have also been effected by byrd's servicesDate of experience: December 26, 2023STSergio Todorovic1 reviewITApr 6, 2022i can say only positive opinion for the…i can say only positive opinion for the professional that the byrd team is showing.Date of experience: April 06, 2022Reply from byrdApr 7, 2022Thank you very much for the great feedback!

The onboarding team is very helpful and always available!Date of experience: November 23, 2021SESteve Ettinger2 reviewsUSUpdated Sep 22, 2023Poorly managed warehouseWe have been working with Byrd for almost three years.  While there were some issues during the first 18 months, overall it was a positive experience due to our account manager.In the past year, things have gotten much worse.Byrd has moved our warehouse locations on two separate occasions, causing disruptions in fulfillment.  On the more recent switch, they lost product during the move.More concerning, their warehouse has continued to make massive mistakes that have cost our company tens of thousands of dollars.In the past month, there have been (at least) three shipments sent to Byrd where their warehouse did not count the product, even though counting was required.  For two of these shipments, we have now been unable to locate the missing product for over a month, causing massive issues with our customer service.The warehouse also has mixed up SKUs on several occasions, sending the wrong product to customers.  We've seen an increase in damages and poor packaging as well.During the holiday season, the warehouse took over a month to inbound one of our shipments and created massive customer service issues with their inability to ship products according to their SLAs.Many of these issues have been brought up many times, and every time Byrd works to address just the individual issue rather than the root cause, making these things happen again and again.While the customer support team at Byrd is very nice, they have no ability to actually solve problems and the logistics team is either doesn't care, or is equally powerless.Management will use copy/paste customer service talk to tell you they're working on the problems, but after a year of inaction, it's clear that it means nothing.UPDATE September 15:  We have now experienced additional problems.  Last week there was a \"yearly inventory count\" and today I found additional mistakes with inventory, plus an additional shipment was not counted.  No shipments are inbounded correctly and the warehouse and logistics team are not capable of solving a problem.  We continue to lose money every day because of Byrd.UPDATE September 18: Still no return phone call even though I was promised weeks ago that this would no longer be a problem.  Inventory issues have still not been resolved.  Social media team deletes comments instead of having someone work on issue or respond.UPDATE September 19: An inventory problem from September 15th still has not been resolved.  Required a simple recount and the warehouse has not done it, delaying orders further.UPDATE September 22: Still not receiving return phone calls and we have discovered additional inventory issues.  Dealing with Byrd is hopeless.Date of experience: August 26, 2023Reply from byrdSep 11, 2023Hi Steve, We're sorry to hear that you had an unpleasant experience with byrd.

Once the onboarding process is completed, it seems like all hopes of decent customer service go out the window.I encountered a significant issue with an inbound shipment, prompting me to take the decision to return the goods to my supplier. Unfortunately, more than a month has passed, and I find myself no closer to a resolution. The customer service team, particularly Farid and Natalia, has been utterly unhelpful.Upon requesting to speak with my account manager, I was shocked to discover that there isn't even one assigned. Instead, I was directed to Elena, who proved equally unhelpful and simply referred me back to the unresponsive customer service team.Attempting to arrange shipping from our end was another frustrating ordeal. After confirming a pickup and going through the trouble of arranging it, we were blindsided on the pickup day. The warehouse insisted we announce the pickup in the system, even though the goods were not registered. Julia from operations, who got involved at this stage, displayed a lack of awareness about the situation and previous communications.Communication with Byrd Fulfillment is a convoluted mess. Attempting to get in touch with anyone beyond the customer service team is an exercise in futility. Account management and operations teams are seemingly unreachable, and when requested, contact information is not provided. Promises that they will get in touch with us have gone unfulfilled.Overall, my experience with Byrd Fulfillment has been disappointing, frustrating, and unprofessional. I would strongly caution anyone considering their services to look elsewhere for a fulfillment provider that values customer satisfaction and effective communication.Date of experience: January 01, 2024JEJerome1 reviewFRApr 8, 2022Great serviceGreat service and good options.

On closing the company - they would not release the goods. Have to stay in for 30 days, even though we had a buyer who was coming to collect the goods!  I even offered to pay in advance my minimum monthly spend of £375, but they would not release the goods (stock that belongs to me).  Initial pricing sounded 'too good to be true' and really affable guy.  They just need to be a bit more honest upfront - to avoid stress, and unnecessary workload.   Have WASTED all morning again, trying to get to the bottom of my pricing - structure.  Very annoying and pointless.  The Customer Service team do try their best to be helpful - but I pity them really, as their company is making their jobs difficult.  Very frustrating to be honest.  I am a Dentist with a Degree - i.e I do not consider myself stupid, but I think the pricing / terms are deliberately opaque.

The problem was this was all Christmas orders. The late delivery combined with the extended booking in time of the delivery, simply due to the time of the year not anyones fault, meant we wouldn't have been able to fulfil Christmas orders. This would have been a disaster for our customers and catastrophic for our business.I got in touch with the Customer Service team and they managed to pull off an absolute miracle. Max who I dealt with went above and beyond. His professionalism, reassuring tone and communication were exceptional. He also managed to deliver what I thought was impossible. This is a massive shout out to Max, the rest of the CS team, The Good In Team and also everyone that works on our Hub. THANK YOU!An absolute Heroic effort by everyone. We can't thank you enough.

Much appreciated.RIRich1 reviewGBApr 30, 2024Two Years Of Fulfillment With Huboo  After choosing Huboo based upon good pricing and good customer feedback in 2022, we've continued to grow our business with their support. We began with just a few SKUs but typically rely on them for all of our fulfillment now.  What is great about Huboo 1- We can drop stock to a warehouse ourselves without having to pay couriers 2- The goods we deliver are usually processed same day and instock - allowing us to better control stock levels and react to bursts of sales or seasonality (so much quicker than FBA3- They handle Merchant Fulfilled Prime deliveries and all our other channels; Etsy, Ebay and Faire 4- The pricing is transparent and consistent 5- We have greatly reduced the number of “damaged in transit”incidents as they pack well 6- They can handle bundles and b2b/wholesale orders 7- The accounts & customer service lines are always answered quickly and they are always helpful if there is an issue 8- The customer dashboard gives us a great view of all deliveries, stock and history, meaning we can self manage. 9- They’ve got coverage in the EU meaning we can begin to scale in more countries (Germany and Spain are next)Although the pricing has gone up since we started, it’s admittedly less so than others / inline with carrier increases and we couldn’t find a comparable service for less. Can highly recommend Huboo to all eCommerce brands who want to spend less time sending goods out and managing the process themselves.Date of experience: April 29, 2024Reply from Huboo Technologies Updated May 16, 2024Hi Rich      Thank you for taking the time to leave a review and for your recommendation.

While their onboarding process seemed smooth initially, once my items were sent to their stock, everything went downhill. Responses from their team were extremely delayed, leaving customers frustrated and causing significant losses to my business. Wrong items were sent, and some items were missing altogether, with no compensation or resolution in sight. Opening a case yielded no results, as no one bothered to respond until multiple follow-up emails were sent. Overall, dealing with Huboo has been nothing short of a nightmare.Date of experience: February 16, 2024Reply from Huboo Technologies Feb 16, 2024We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.

Thank you   Team HubooAAAA2 reviewsGBSep 11, 2024We lost a significant portion of our…We lost a significant portion of our inventory over a year ago while it was stored in their warehouse. Initially, they claimed a police investigation was necessary before discussing further actions. It took them months to receive a response, and after even more waiting, we were shocked to see their report only accounted for 10% of the actual missing items. We had no option but to review the inventory records in their platform, only to discover they'd changed their system and no longer had access to the old logs. That alone is unbelievable! Lost access to old inventory reports???But it didn’t stop there. After dozens of more emails, we finally received a manual report. BUT that was an incorrect report. They deducted a large outgoing shipment twice. We pointed out their mistakes, but they were simply making different excuses to avoid accepting it.They dragged the process out for 9 more exhausting months of communication. Only then did they finally admit it. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVENTORY IS LOST. Sadly, it didn’t end there!Although they acknowledged, they told us they could only escalate the issue to management. Okay, no problem—we understood and waited. But, as you might have already noticed the pattern, this led to several more months of hopeless waiting. Once again, they strung us along.-----------------------As a business owner, I have an aversion to writing negative reviews. However, when I posted one about 10 months ago, they called me within hours, asking me to remove the review with promise of resolving the issue. Regrettably, I removed my last negative review.Date of experience: September 11, 2024BEBen4 reviewsGBDec 13, 2023We've been using Huboo for just over 3…We've been using Huboo for just over 3 months and it's been absolutely perfect so far! All of the Huboo staff that we've dealt with (from sales to warehouse) have been genuinely lovely and friendly people, super helpful and professional, but especially Marta who's helped so much with our onboarding, we can't thank her enough. We're a small business and this was our first time using a 3PL so we had tonnes of questions to start with, we also have a relatively complicated/manual order packing process which we thought would make it difficult, but they've made it all so easy and followed our bespoke instructions exactly without any issues so we're really happy. Every quality check that we've done has been perfect, and we've not had a single complaint from customers!

I had serious fulfilmentfrustrations trying to resolve any of the issues, these included:Losing huge amounts of stock we shipped into their warehouse.Increasing the prices we had agreed in the contract.Erratic billing, bills were incorrect or inconsistent.Terrible shipment tracking, it was unavailable or broken despite being shipped on a tracked service.Support tickets just piled up and very few issues were ever resolved.The wrong items were continually shipped despite us requesting action to stop it happening.Save your time, your money and your business by using a reputable company to provide your fulfilment requirements.

We shipping and fulfillment costs are competitive, but where we struggle the most is with the handling of product, we've have a lot of damaged product and due to terms and conditions most of our items since they're not for sale (it's a reward redemption program) we're unable to issue claims for the loss of damaged product in transit due to packaging, having to pay for both product replacements and reshipments on many orders.

If you have the option for another fulfillment party, do not use Shipbpob. We have been using 4 different fulfillment parties worldwide for years. We use Shipbob in the UK. We ship far fewer packages via Shipbob than with other the parties, but we have many more problems, such as errors in their system, wrong products being shipped, they have problems with the HRMC and cannot solve it, which means we can no longer send anything, products that are suddenly out-of-stock due to an error, etc. etc.And the biggest problem is, the customer service is terrible and very difficult to reach. So in addition to all the problems, we cannot solve it properly because they are not easily reachable.There is always something that can go wrong in fulfillment and transport, you always have to take that into account.

LHLiz Hilton2 reviewsUSOct 8, 2024I am so dissapointedI am so dissapointed. I worked for years to get my product into Australia. I was so excited to launch this market so I could get my customers their time sensitive product faster. What happened? Communication missmanagment and it took over a week to get the products shipped. I could have more easily shipped from my warehouse in the US it would have been faster.The only value add for my custoemrs is speed and they were slow.Customer service is a joke. I had to stay up to midnight to talk with anyone over there because they will not work around customer time zones. Who does that?WHen I set my site live before they were ready they said it was my fault! When it was communicated to me by my Aussie rep that it would be good to go once inventory was recieved!  I feel like an idiot for not reading all these negative reviews before doing business. It's been a week. I am going to put all my products on sale and get out of this ASAP.

Date of experience: October 22, 2024AMAmy1 reviewCAOct 17, 2024Best User Interface and Customer Service We have been working with ShipBob for the past three years for all of our e-commerce fulfillment. As our business has grown, ShipBob's fulfillment has seamlessly kept up with our increasing order volume and SKUs. They have consistently ensured that orders are shipped on time, which has been particularly important for our Amazon operations.In addition to their reliable and timely fulfillment, their customer support team is exceptional. As we’ve expanded, ShipBob assigned us a personal merchant care specialist who has been outstanding in handling any requests or questions.Their user interface is also incredibly helpful—it allows us to easily access data on costs, fulfillment locations, and order details. There are many specialized features that enable customization and kitting for orders. Their financial reports break down billing to the cent, making it easy to see exactly where all fees come from—there are no hidden costs.The only downside to ShipBob, which is also one of their strengths, is their size. Being a large company, specialized or customized requests are not automatic and often require coordination with their support team. This is particularly true for conditional picking or special packaging. Personalized touches are not standard, but ShipBob has introduced some beta features recently to address this.However, their size also brings many advantages: more warehousing locations, a more robust interface, better costs, faster fulfillment times, and higher quality support. Ultimately, it depends on your specific needs.Date of experience: October 17, 2024Jacob Spencer1 reviewUSOct 15, 2024Logistics Ritesh is great at keeping up with our account and fixing any issues that arise.Date of experience: October 15, 2024C.C.Sales1 reviewUSAug 30, 2024Customer orientedShipbob is very easy to work with.

There is no support/communication with anyone IN warehouse which means operational errors may take months to resolve (and may come up again a year later like it did with us). Then though they say they will reimburse for 5x the shipping costs/massive incorrect packaging, they won't. Lost a lot of money and resources on their inability to correct an obvious issue - such as shipping a single pin in a 18x15x6\" box. Crazy.It's been too expensive now to move warehouses and we're just dealing with it. While everyone I have been in contact with has been kind and I wish I could say this experience was better, I can't.

I would give 5-stars to our account manager, Ritesh, who is always jumping in and helping us with day-to-day items.

Their staff is very knowledgeable and always go the extra mile to help your brand out. Savi has been especially great in growing our brand and making sure we can deliver to every customer out there.The dashboard is solid as well and helps our DTC business operate smoothly. The analytics are transparent and helpful, and it's overall very easy to navigate the software to ensure seamless deliveries to customers.Date of experience: April 25, 2024Katelyn Hughes1 reviewUSApr 17, 2024Excellent Support Manger and Always Improving TechnologyOur company started to work with ShipBob in 2021/2022. They have made big improvements since that time. We have had the same Customer Care Manager Anuja who has been critical to us solving problems within our account and I consider her an extension of us in supporting us from the inner side of the 3PL. Overall I have been very happy with ShipBob. We had some hiccups along with way, mostly with Amazon connections and orders, but if anything was wrong ShipBob did take ownership and properly credited us or worked through it. Anuja is top notch and I highly recommend ShipBob overall. Date of experience: April 17, 2024Rachel Hicks1 reviewGBMay 9, 2024Enjoy working with the Shipbob teamEnjoy working with the Shipbob team. Their work ethic, client support team and willingness to help are second to none. We always appreciate the new ideas the team come up with to help fix certain situations. Date of experience: May 09, 2024Joseph Lieberman1 reviewUSApr 22, 2024Over 5 YearsWe've worked with Shipbob for over 5 years now with facilities in the US, Canada, UK, EU, and soon Australia. While no 3PL is perfect and we've had a number of issues over the years, I believe they've always acted and reacted professionally to problems. I strongly believe that's about as good as it gets when it comes to 3PL and warehousing partners. Mistakes are going to happen, the important thing is how your partner deals with them.Other than that, they have worked exactly as specified and without them I believe we would have struggled greatly to expand overseas as quickly as we have.Date of experience: April 22, 2024DNDavid N1 reviewUSOct 23, 2024Excellent 3PLExcellent 3PL, always responsive to any issues and takes requests seriously.

We've been working with Shipbob for over five years, and they keep improving. Ann is quick in responding to emails and happy to think along, improving our company's shipping solutions.Recently, we have been working with Ann and Bailey on Shipbob's new Inventory Placement Program (IPP), and this will be extremely helpful for our logistics, significantly increasing our shipping efficiency. Thanks to Ann and Bailey we got the ball rolling and starting this.If you're looking for a reliable 3PL solution + a team that cares. Shipbob should be at the top of your list. Thanks Team Shipbob!Date of experience: April 17, 2024RERenae2 reviewsUSApr 27, 2024Easy to useEasy to use! We're a small business and in order to grow we had to find a new solution. We couldn't keep coming to the office every weekend to pack orders anymore. We shopped around with local vendors but Shipbob's easy to use platform sold us. We've had a few issues with packages missing but not as many issues as we had on our own. Our rep Savita is always super helpful and responsive as well if we have any issues. I really appreciate her being there for us. Its great to have this part of our business outsourced so we can focus on our product sales, manufacturing and marketing. Thanks Shipbob!

We use them for global fulfillment of our snowboard and ski training products and they make our business run far smoother than we could do ourselves.

I hope to keep our fulfillment with ShipBob for a very long time!Date of experience: April 24, 2024ADAdrian Dsouza8 reviewsINMay 23, 2024VerifiedOne has to be stupid to choose Shipbob…One has to be stupid to choose Shipbob despite there being hundreds of nightmare experiences people have shared on reddit. I certainly was.Let's start with losing stock. The Aside from losing stock and overcharging for storage, their fulfillment rates are at least 65% higher than others. The whole idea of not bother customers with line level details of fulfillment is so that they can openly steal from us. Let's take an example of a package weighing x lbs going to zone 9 (Highest of the USPS zones)Based on another 3PL's rate card, $10.00 Postage$2.50 Order fulfillment fee (including pick fee for first item)$1.00 Pick fee for two additional items in the order$0.50 packagingThis totals $14, Shipbob charged me $25. These overbillings cost me $1-1.5K in the last week I was with them and they refuse to share the breakdown of the fees.If you want to see your business burn to the ground with charges that you can't see and make no sense of compared to the competition, I highly recommend Shipbob.Date of experience: May 17, 2024Esti Amba3 reviewsNZJul 17, 2024Good fulfilment I've used Shipbob for at least 5 years and apart from some occasional mistakes they've been really good.

On 10th January 2023, I received an email telling me the item was in transit to the retailer!  I've messaged the company, still awaiting a response.

Registered the return though ReBound, as described, but nowhere does it say WHERE to drop off the parcel to. There is zero guidance on either Kitbag or ReBound, and no contact option. Also, it says it is 'paper-less' as I have no printer, and then they send you a load of documents via email you need to print off. Scandalous how companies get away with this. Never shopping with Kitbag again.ReBound - Where do I take my parcel to?

DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE! After selecting a return option that didn’t require a printer, I was directed to print labels and return documents (once the return generated and was paid for). No one has collected the parcel and it’s been a week. There is no one to talk with but a “bot” who refers you back to the retailer. Worst return process I have ever experienced.Date of experience: March 17, 2022Reply from ReBoundMar 23, 2022Hi Lauren, Sorry to hear no-one arrived to collect your parcel, this must be an error on the carriers side.

After dropping your parcel off it can take a few days for your item to arrive back to the retailer, and the retailer will then also advise their own refund policy. Your parcel should be heading back to the retailer as planned, and you should receive your refund within shopDisney's advertised refund timeframe.Kind Regards, The ReBound TeamDYDon Yates3 reviewsGBDec 20, 2022Returned an order at AsdaReturned an order at Asda on the 9/12/22.

The jacket was delivered to the return address they specified but they claim that they don't have it and that it is still in the post even though I have tracked proof that it was delivered to the address that they specified.

Like so many others, I paid the scam payment of £7.20 or whatever it was. Fanatics will no longer accept the return as it's past the \"Christmas return threshold\" (LOL) by 1 day. They employ this scam company clearly for two reasons: to rake in more money for profit whilst simultaneously stalling the returns process until you give up. No returns places have heard of them, they all need a QR code so it gets stuck. And, like me, you're left with a Lakers hoodie from fanatics who failed to mention that it's a crop hoodie! Like most normal humans, I quite like getting an entire hoodie not just half for £60. Anyway, avoid at all costs - both companies.Date of experience: December 16, 2022Reply from ReBoundFeb 3, 2023Hi Steven, Sorry to hear you've had difficulty with your return.

I won't be buying from them again if they use tin pot courier services like this. I've contacted Rebound. No response. I was told by Belstaff that they allow a few days in transit for the parcel.

Paid another carriage charge for it. Was provided a returns location close to me so i took it thereand left it in good faith (no receipts are available with this service, apparently, so no proof). 4 weeks after doing this I chased the supplier (kitbag) and they referred me to ReBound who hadnt received the kit yet. No reciept of proof. went back to return location and they dont have the parcel anymore. Spoke to Royal mail who the return is booked with and they dont have any live tracking information which suggests it never left the shop. I have been back twice since and no one there knows anything about it. Im not really sure what else to do now to get my refund.

Bizarre! I managed to find a way via the retailer website to make my return but it was absolutely no thanks to ReBound. Thinking reBound needs to ReThink its approach and user experience. Their TrustPilot reviews tell the story. If I was a retailer using the reBound services I would be very concerned. Customers will seek simpler alternative ways to shop online to avoid this mess. Returns are a key aspect of Online shopping using a service that is simple and reliable is essential. Please do not reply to this and say something like \"due to the busy Xmas period blah blah...\" yes we know Xmas is busy! it comes with the job so sort your crap out. Also please don't use COVID as an excuse for your crap site. Will be avoiding retailers who use ReBound until I see a steady stream of 4 and 5 star reviews on here.Date of experience: January 13, 2022Reply from ReBoundJan 13, 2022Hi there, Sorry to hear you had trouble with your return. You shouldn't need to visit ReBOUND's website to either register or track your return - which is why our website is not shopper focused. Any information you need should be detailed in the retailers returns policy on their website. Could you let us know who you were returning to so we can speak to the retailer about how this process could be improved? Thanks! Rebecca Clayborn1 reviewGBAug 1, 2023This company is clearly a jokeI was sending an ASOS package back using ReBound. I sent it off on the 16/03/2023, it is now 01/08/2023 and my package has not been recieved by ASOS (who obviously won't take pity at the return attempt and refund me). The email tracking still shows that the package is at the local hub so is clearly sitting there waiting for transit. And to top it off when I attempt to use the tracking number on the site it simply diverts me to an error page. This is a very sub par company who clearly have nothing in control. Please don't use them if you can!!!!! Alot of my friends have had the same experience with this company.

It has been over 4 weeks that my parcel is \"in transit to retailer\" however the location stays the same the message changes. I wish I read the reviews before I filed a return now I am so hesitant to even shop online. I am pretty sure it is illegal for a company to have no customer service to speak to ( I can't even find their contact information), they even state they can't check individual returns and respond to enquires... does this company even exist???!

Customers frequently get stuck when attempting to submit a claim and cannot get support from AfterShip, who direct them to us, and we are unable to do anything with the platform. AfterShip’s model is to deduct any refunds from the monthly premium total, however if your refunds exceed the monthly total the only payment option is PayPal, who are notorious for disabling customer accounts or freezing funds. We have now been fighting with AfterShip for over 2 months to receive the several thousand dollars they owe us for a customer claim, and AfterShip’s only option is a wire transfer that they charge $45 each time, and so far have failed twice to successfully send to our bank account. We are removing them, in favor of Route, and strongly suggest that others avoid them at all costs.\nTheir tracking system is basic at best, and cheaper, and more reliable options, exist. One example of how basic their system is - if an order ships in multiple parts, and one part is delivered before a subsequent part is shipped, AfterShip considers the order closed and will not notify the customer of any subsequent shipments.Date of experience: September 16, 2024JNJohn Nash1 reviewDEMar 24, 2023Quick supportQuick support. no useless or hidden stuff, just perfect!Date of experience: March 24, 2023AdvertisementJohan Hallin2 reviewsGBMar 13, 2023Ankit have helped me a great deal with…Ankit have helped me a great deal with my Aftership set. super friendly and helpful.Date of experience: March 13, 2023Ann Meredith1 reviewUSMar 13, 2023quick response to extend my trial…quick response to extend my trial period.  the program is super!Date of experience: March 13, 2023Martin Paquette2 reviewsCAFeb 23, 2023Great support as always!Great support as always.

To be honest, their interface is confusing as f*, and there are many functions you aren't able to carry out on your own, which means, you'll have to contact support. Contacting support meant longer wait times, and my SPECIFIC customer service attendant had the audacity to give me attitude, saying she did not want to help me with my processes simply because they \"weren't supposed to interfere\". So now I'm left with products STUCK at their warehouse, and not a single clue as to what to do next.

In fact, at the beginning, the commercial will be super nice and convincing. They will make you think that everything you specify and you want is doable. But unfortunately, you’ll realize real fast that you made a huge mistake, and that your products are stuck at their warehouse, with no clue how to deal with that situation. 4 orders out of 4, disastrous. My packagings weren’t used. The shipping days AND COSTS mentioned in the first place are tremendously exceeded. If I could get all of my products back, I would definitely do that. They’re doing an amateur job so far. So if you want to build a brand with a strong professional image, just find you another partner.Date of experience: October 09, 2023Reply from NextSmartShipUpdated Nov 8, 2023We deeply regret to hear about your recent experience with NSS. We understand the frustration and disappointment you've encountered, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.Your feedback is invaluable to us, and we want to emphasize that the situation you encountered is of an extremely rare occurrence. We have conducted a thorough investigation into the issues you raised and are committed to improving our warehouse operations from the ground up to prevent similar situations from happening in the future.We acknowledge that the disparity between our initial promises and the actual service you received is a concern.

Our aim is to provide a high level of service, and we have taken the necessary steps to ensure that your future experiences align more closely with your expectations.Given that you are currently on holiday, we would like to suggest that we schedule a meeting with you once you return.

I communicated with them right up until a week or so before my launch. They quoted several prices (which I used) to estimate shipping for my backers. Now, as soon as I launch my campaign, they have stopped all communication. It has been over two weeks, and they have not replied to my three or four attempts to contact them. How can you trust a company that completely disappears AFTER you launch a product, and have planned to rely on them? AVOID.Date of experience: September 20, 2020Reply from NextSmartShipSep 23, 2020Hi, thank you for the feedback. I think we have some mistsandings here. We will close the lead and make a whatsapp group once a customer is successfully registered and get a customer ID, we saw you have replied in the group yesterday, so I think the communication problem has been solved.

We have been sourcing for products in China for quite some time to deliver all over the world, but we could not find a good fulfillment company to help us in delivery. NextSmartShip has been a great partner in helping us in this area, and we have had a great experience working with them.

Hence I am here to drop them a quick review and would recommend them to any companies.Date of experience: November 11, 2020ANAnass5 reviewsFRNov 30, 2023Unmatched level of unprofessionalismMy associate already shared her bad experience but I feel like I need to share mine too. The level of unprofessionalism is beyond imagination. They asked to meet us to find a solution and when finally a date was set (they picked the day and time slot), we had to wake up early for that call, and literally 1min before the meeting, we ask about the link to the meeting and our sales simply says « sorry Shirley isn’t available today ». Sorry what ?Needless to say that the prices have been constantly rising. And last but not least, when it doesn’t suit them, they only offer express shipping with +60$ for countries in EUROPE. This company is a joke.

However, at some point, the business burden was so huge that the companies were unable to meet our business needs. So, one day, I read a customer's review about NextSmartShip in a Facebook group and how the company helped her brand in the growing stage.Hence, I approached NextSmartShip and filled in the necessary details. Then, within a few moments, Shirley (one of their customer representatives) reached me. I presented my queries to her and she told me about the company's ability to deal with such scenarios. So, it wasn't long that I became a permanent customer of this company because the company helped me to improve customer support and boost customer loyalty.Date of experience: September 25, 2021AdvertisementDEDereks1 reviewESJun 6, 2024VerifiedGreat service overall but...Overall, NextSmartShip has been a reliable company.

AvoidDate of experience: January 01, 2023CNChef Nosif5 reviewsTWFeb 26, 2024A terrible experience!!A terrible experience!!! After several video calls with their seller based in Holland, I was confident in NSS... a grave mistake!!! The seller and their system announced a $9 delivery from China. I received a price increase... but only due to the size of the package... no specific amount, so I accepted. But the surprise was huge because NSS added another $10 on top of that!!!!Result... the delivery cost more than my product for sale.No problem, I decided to stop my collaboration, retrieve my products worth $2000 and my balance of $350... they said the seller would contact me... nothing at all!!!!Result... I lost $2000 and my $350 balance.Their scam... yes because NSS is not honest and they are very well organized. It goes like this... the sellers and their systems announce a very low price... and then you receive an email stating that the box is bigger, going from 0.900g to... 2.100kg, solely based on the box dimensions and no price... so I accepted the increase because I never imagined they would charge $10 more!!!!I discovered it in the system when my client received it.My advice... if you want to collaborate with fulfillment companies... go ahead but definitely not with NextSmartShip!!!!Date of experience: February 15, 2024Reply from NextSmartShipFeb 29, 2024Dear Chef,We sincerely apologize for any confusion regarding the shipping costs for your items.

All in all the communication with Rita, July and Nikko goes quite smooth and the cost is very good.  Shipments usually are sent out the same day, so very fast.  The paperwork and admin with them is quite limited which is good for small companies who need some fast service and flexibility.  For us the only downsides are the fact that Shopify is only partially integrated with international warehouses (tracking number is not sent back and we still have to confirm the orders in their system).  Second issue is that NSS is outsourcing their international warehousing to other larger logistics companies, which means that when there is a problem with a shipment it can take a while until things are cleared out between them and the larger warehousing/logistics partners.Date of experience: October 13, 2020Reply from NextSmartShipOct 14, 2020Hi, thank you for the feedback.

Although it hurt my business big time they did there sincere best to solve the issue and we're very cooperative.Horrible experienceI started working with NSS fulfillment company two months ago, and I'm grateful that I didn't entrust all our operations to them. Despite their promising claims, I've had a disappointing experience with their services. A major issue is their lack of pricing transparency, and their fulfillment process has proven to be quite problematic.Numerous orders were returned after weeks of processing, attributed to \"my failure\" to use the correct shipping channel. The frustrating part is that I had no such issues when working with other fulfillment agents for the same product. The company has now offered me the option to switch shipping channels after the hassle of reshelving and refunding the orders, which is a time-consuming process + the shipping channel they recommend is almost twice as expensive and comes without refund option! CrazyBased on my experience, I would caution others against working with this fulfillment company if you aim to establish something sustainable. It's advisable not to hold a significant amount of stock with them due to the uncertainties and inconsistencies in their services.Date of experience: January 12, 2024Reply from NextSmartShipJan 31, 2024Dear Anti,Thank you for sharing your experience with NextSmartShip and updating the review.

Very awful. They lost my package soon after it arrived to one of their facilities. It was a rare and expensive book. What's worse, their policy states they reserve the right to throw away any lost or undeliverable packages they might have in their possession. The book being expensive is one thing, but the idea they will almost certainly dispose of a very rare book if they have it in their possession (with only a few surviving copies) is upsetting. At least send rare or expensive packages back to the seller/original owner if found or if it was marked as undeliverable. Worst shippers I have ever used and will avoid for good.

Phone support is available from a growth or premium subscription. For your current subscription, we offer support via e-mail or live chat. The live chat is available from Monday to Friday (09:00-17:30). With this, you have the option to talk to someone from the support team, who can help you with any of your questions.I am sorry to hear if any additional costs have been charged after creating your label. For this, I would advise you to check out our Help Center. These additional costs are, unfortunately, charged via the carrier and Sendcloud doesn't have an influence on this. Of course, if you have any questions related to these costs, our support team is there to help you out.Apologies for any inconvenience.- RowieJSJS5 reviewsGBJan 30, 2024Great if everything works... but don't expect supportGreat if everything works, but you're on your own, if you require help from customer support. The Parcelforce integration stopped working several months ago (they changed something their end and it wasn't able to generate international labels anymore). Customer service is just delaying and delaying but no fix is anywhere in sight. They are just not interested, I guess not many customers are using Parcelforce. Interestingly they are still advertising Parcelforce as supported carrier (hey competition, that's something for you...). And then I dared to ask if I could get a refund for the period my main carrier wasn't available (several months..) and they offered me gracefully £4... because I generated one DHL label per month. That's unfortunately not the type of support expected if you want to rely on Sendcloud for business critical activities.Date of experience: January 30, 2024Reply from SendcloudFeb 5, 2024Hello, We are very sorry you are unhappy with our services. I have tried to reach out to you via phone, and then I have just emailed you to address the subjects you mention here more in detail. I just want to mention that there was a workaround for the Parcelforce issue, the international labels are generated and our support team can send them to you. Also, Parcelforce label creation works just fine for all the  national parcels.We could not do a refund of your subscription as you have used the platform for other features and because the issue you mention had a workaround available. The fact that it has not been resolved yet is due to the fact that our team prioritizes the bug/ feature open tickets according to the impact that it has on our customers. This particular feature you're mentioning is part of a very specific feature of our entire product.  The development team needs to make these decisions and prioritize its work. We realize that we are, unfortunately, disappointing some of our customers by not fixing some issues as fast as they would expect. I regret that you were one of the users affected, and we couldn't fix this in time for you.I am available to discuss this further with you and I'll be waiting for you reply to my email.

I guess they are breaking under there own success. Response times on the support desk are now over a month. After a month you get an initial / standard response, not the actual solution to your problems. When you call they promise you the world, but they don't deliver. Instead of focusing on customer service they are focusing on squeezing more money out of the customers. Recent changes like, pay per label, but more annoying the not announced change that you can now only have a maximum of 10 shipping rules. Imagine waking up, logging in, and seeing all your shipments messed up just because Sendcloud is trying to make more money, again. I cant believe how they are destroying this company. They respond to negative reviews, but they don't respond to your tickets, calls, e-mails.The platform has a bunch of technical problems, and international addresses get converted completely from WooCommerce -> Sencloud. This means package gets lost all the time. I don't think in my 30 years of being an entrepreneur I have been more disappointed with a company. It started so well, it ended so badly. Shame on you Sendcloud, shame on you.Just have a look at the recent reviews of last 2 months, and you see the proof of my statements.Date of experience: June 02, 2023Reply from SendcloudJun 6, 2023Dear Herbert,We're sorry to hear that you have been waiting for a reply from our customer service team in regard to your case, and you are unhappy with our services.The last couple of days, we have been in touch and shared an update on the case, which has been escalated to our technical department. Please know that they are doing everything they can to provide you with a solution.Recently, there was an update in plans to make it easier for all our customers to access our software. Our new plans feature a lower fixed fee, along with a variable fee based on the number of shipping labels generated. This pricing structure accommodates the seasonality of e-commerce and ensures that you only pay for what you use.My sincere apologies for the inconvenience.Thomas21 reviewsGBJul 3, 2024I want to cancel the service as we…I want to cancel the service as we don't require it anymore, but there isn't a way of doing this on their system and it's impossible to contact anyone to speak to.

Great to hear how you have been satisfied with Sendcloud throughout the years. On to many more!- RowieTOTheo Overmeer1 reviewNLSep 11, 2024Horrible ExperienceAs a business that exports a significant volume of shipments, I initially thought Sendcloud would help streamline the process. However, it quickly became apparent that they were completely unprepared to handle the complexities of international shipping. Right from the start, I encountered constant issues with customs documents. Packages were repeatedly placed on hold because of incorrect or incomplete documentation provided by Sendcloud. In many cases, the Incoterm regulations were handled incorrectly, leading to further delays and confusion at customs.These errors caused major disruptions to my business, with shipments held for days – sometimes even weeks – as I scrambled to sort out the mess caused by Sendcloud’s negligence. The additional fees associated with these delays and complications were staggering, and it’s shocking how unprepared they are to manage something as basic as customs procedures for international shipments.When I tried reaching out to Sendcloud for help, their support team was completely ineffective. I was bounced between agents, and no one seemed to have a clear understanding of how to resolve these issues. Each call or email left me more confused, with no real solutions provided. It felt like I was being given the runaround instead of receiving actual support.On top of the customs complications, the costs escalated quickly. Whenever there was an issue, the fees just kept adding up, and none of these charges were made clear from the outset. What should have been straightforward shipments turned into expensive headaches because of Sendcloud's incompetence.Looking back, choosing Sendcloud was a costly mistake. The financial damage and stress I’ve experienced could have been easily avoided had I chosen a more competent shipping provider. Their lack of accountability and inability to handle international shipments properly has had a huge negative impact on my business.I strongly advise anyone considering Sendcloud to look elsewhere – especially if you rely on smooth, reliable international shipping. The promises of convenience and efficiency couldn’t be further from the truth.Date of experience: September 11, 2024Reply from SendcloudSep 18, 2024Dear Theo,Thank you for taking the time to share your experience.

Previously, we had the challenge of shipping our parcels through various courier companies with direct contracts. Dealing with these companies was often a hassle, from the near-impossible task of reaching customer service representatives to the complexities of filing claims for damaged or lost items.Then came Sendcloud, and our shipping process took a remarkable turn for the better.  Sendcloud offers exceptional one-on-one service, and their platform seamlessly integrates with our Shopify store. Their 'scan and go' feature streamlines the process of picking and packing orders, making it quick and simple. This integration allows us to effortlessly print shipping labels and keeps our customers updated with comprehensive tracking and live updates from the courier. What's more, Sendcloud enables us to send branded shipping emails with real-time updates to all our customers.The standout feature for us is the top-notch customer service. The live chat feature within the Sendcloud app is a real time-saver, with a friendly team always ready to assist. You won't find yourself waiting for more than a minute to get the help you need. Any issues are swiftly resolved. Sendcloud also offers the advantage of securing special rates with certain couriers and the option to add your own contracted courier accounts, such as Royal Mail, to their platform. They can also provide insurance for parcels.Additionally, Sendcloud provides a customisable return portal for customers who wish to make returns.One of the key highlights is having an account manager at your disposal. They ensure you're well-informed about new features and provide assistance tailored to your business needs. They genuinely make an effort to understand your specific requirements and go the extra mile to simplify things.In summary, Sendcloud is an app we wholeheartedly recommend to any company that prioritizes its customers. It's all about making life easier for sellers while delivering an exceptional service to customers. If you're not using Sendcloud, you're not shipping efficiently. As the saying goes, 'If you know, you know.'\"Date of experience: October 20, 2023Reply from SendcloudNov 3, 2023Hi,Thank you for your 5-star review and positive feedback! Super cool to hear how you have been able to automate your whole shipping process with Sendcloud and the help of our team :)- RowieCUCustomer3 reviewsNLUpdated Dec 8, 2023Not recommendedI have been using sendcloud every once in a while. On average the prices are about the same, but the overview was convenient.  For a large package I accidentally entered the wrong country. If I would have tried to send it with the postal office instead of sendcloud, their system would have picked up on it, giving me a chance to correct it. Sendcloud seems to overrule this system however and it made sure my package was send to a country, which didn’t have that particular street, postal code or city, and never informed me there was something wrong. Luckily I saw quickly I made a mistake and immediately contacted sendcloud. Several times. Ideally sendcloud could let the postal service reroute it to the correct adres. The worst thing for the receiver would be to have to wait for the package to be send back after a week. Over a week later sendcloud responded... The employee, who clearly had not read any of the messages I send sendcloud in the meantime, kindly suggested the package could be picked up, blissfully unaware of the fact the parcel was in the wrong country that entire week.In terms of basic functionality of their software and customer service, this is one of my worst experiences with a company in years. The dead silence combined with them managing to downgrade of the postal service’ own level of quality, resulting in what will probably be double the cost for me as the sender and a lot of additional waiting time and frustration definitely for the receiver compared to the usual experience of the local postal office makes me regret using sendcloud.Update: Sendcloud has offered to refund the costs, which is a reasonable solution considering the package is already on its way back, but it remains a frustrating experience.Date of experience: December 06, 2023Reply from SendcloudDec 14, 2023Dear,Sorry to hear that something went wrong with the delivery of your parcel and how the case has been handled. I am happy to hear that we found a solution together.Regarding the addresses; we will forward this feedback internally so we can hopefully prevent this in the future. Unfortunately, sometimes the addresses can't be adjusted in the meantime (mainly with shipments abroad).

I began using Sendcloud in March 2024, a few months after launching my business and trying out other shipping platforms. At first, I was impressed by the user-friendly interface and competitive pricing, but my experience quickly soured due to several significant issues.One of the major problems was with the management of shipping labels. I encountered repeated technical issues where labels couldn’t be voided properly, resulting in full charges for labels I never used. This led to an additional €8,000 in costs before I was eventually reimbursed. The process to resolve these issues was overly complicated—voiding and manually deleting labels was neither efficient nor automated.I also faced issues with forced plan upgrades. I was pushed into a more expensive plan despite not needing the additional features, simply because the process for changing the primary user was poorly explained.Things took a turn for the worse in June 2024 when my team began importing larger quantities from a new supplier in Italy. The system generated an invoice 10 days after the previous one instead of the usual 14, creating financial strain. Even after reaching out to support, I received no satisfactory explanation.The situation reached a new low when I was informed that our account would be banned due to an alleged connection with another account. After waiting 2-3 weeks for a resolution, I was simply banned without further explanation. Despite adhering to all terms of service and legal requirements, I was told the ban might be reversed, which made no sense—why impose a ban and then claim you'll work on lifting it?Moreover, I discovered through a third party that Sendcloud’s shipping rates are often 40-50% higher than what they actually pay to carriers in some cases. This markup is substantial, and it’s clear that Sendcloud is making a significant profit at the expense of its customers. This pricing strategy, combined with poor customer service, suggests a troubling pattern.It seems that many others are experiencing similar issues, which might indicate that the management is deliberately running things this way. While Sendcloud might be attracting new businesses and showing positive numbers in the short term, I believe that the overall customer experience is deteriorating. If they continue down this path, they may face significant backlash as more users encounter the same problems.Overall, my experience with Sendcloud has been marred by technical difficulties, forced upgrades, billing issues, an arbitrary account ban, and opaque pricing practices. I hope this detailed account helps others make an informed decision and encourages Sendcloud to address these significant problems before their customer base suffers further.Date of experience: September 02, 2024RCRichard Copestake2 reviewsGBJul 13, 2024SendCloud: A Review from the TrenchesWell, strap in, dear readers, because today’s tale involves the wild ride that is SendCloud. If you’re here looking for a glowing review, you might want to hit the back button right about now. This is a no-holds-barred account of my less-than-stellar experience with this company.Customer Service: Aggressive and BizarreLet’s kick things off with the customer service, shall we? Imagine having an account manager whose default setting is “aggressive.” You know the type – condescending tone, abrupt emails, and a knack for making you feel like an idiot for asking a simple question. It’s like they’ve taken a page out of the “How to Lose Customers and Alienate People” handbook. If you’re looking for a bit of support and guidance, brace yourself for a ride through the Twilight Zone of customer service.Faceless and IndifferentSendCloud operates like a well-oiled machine, but not in the good way. When things go wrong – and believe me, they will – you’re left shouting into the void. There’s no one there who actually gives a crap about your business or your problems. It’s a faceless entity that shrugs off your issues with the indifference of a cat that’s knocked over your favourite vase. Good luck getting any meaningful response or resolution.Onboarding: Sink or SwimStarting a new account with SendCloud? Prepare to be thrown in the deep end without a life jacket. The onboarding process is non-existent. No hand-holding, no guidance, just a quick “here you go” and a pat on the back as you flounder in the murky waters of their system. It’s like they’ve forgotten that onboarding is supposed to help you succeed, not make you feel like you’ve just signed up for a particularly sadistic reality show.Collections: The No-Show SpectacleNow, onto collections. Or should I say, the collections that never show up. Imagine scheduling a collection, planning your day around it, only to be left waiting like a kid whose dad never shows up to pick him up from football practice. No apology, no explanation, just a deafening silence and a pile of unsent packages. It’s beyond frustrating; it’s downright infuriating.Zero Empathy for Small BusinessesYou’d think a company like SendCloud would have a bit of empathy for small, growing businesses. Think again. They treat you with the same disdain a cat reserves for a half-eaten mouse. No understanding, no flexibility, just a cold, clinical approach that makes you feel like you’re an inconvenience rather than a customer. If you’re a small business looking for a bit of support and understanding, you won’t find it here.Inflexibility: The Unyielding FortressFinally, let’s talk about their inflexibility. Trying to get them to adapt to your needs is like trying to bend a steel beam with your bare hands. They have their way of doing things, and if it doesn’t work for you, tough luck. There’s no room for negotiation or adaptation. It’s their way or the highway, and don’t let the door hit you on the way out.Conclusion: A Word to the WiseIn conclusion, if you’re considering SendCloud, think long and hard about what you’re getting into. It’s a company that excels in making you feel small, insignificant, and thoroughly unsupported. The aggressive customer service, lack of onboarding, unreliable collections, indifference to small businesses, and rigid inflexibility all add up to a thoroughly unpleasant experience.Consider this a cautionary tale from someone who’s been through the wringer. There are better options out there – ones that actually give a damn about you and your business. So, do yourself a favour and look elsewhere. You’ll thank me later.Date of experience: July 12, 2024michael los4 reviewsNLApr 20, 2023Easy to use and intuitiveEasy to use and intuitive. Lot of flexibility within platform.

So basically the Sendcloud nominated day delivery would allow customers to choose say bank holiday Monday or Christmas Day to have their order delivered. So I contact Sendcloud about this numerous times saying that they are letting customers choose delivery dates that are not deliverable on which meant customers would complain to us that the order didn't come the day they chose.Sendcloud plaid dumb on this at every opportunity, I had numerous tickets and they said it was a \"Feature request\" and not a fault. I argued this was a flaw in the system, how can you allow your plugin to let customers choose deliver dates which can not be delivered on. They would pretend I wasn't making sense and then pass my ticket to someone else who was clueless. This was a long running issue they never addressed. I even wrote them the logic of the code to make the amendments, offered to write the code in PHP for them and even gave them simple html/css methods of hiding these dates all of which they ignored and to this day still have not fixed.I closed my business yesterday and the biggest relief of all is getting rid of Sendcloud.Each day between 3 and 5pm the service also either goes down or slows down to a rate that is unbearable.Additionally we had our own account with DPD, UPS and Royal Mail but somehow they managed to start charging us creating the labels on their accounts not ours.Literally avoid at all costs, had I not closed my business I would have wrote my own api integration with DPD which I had done on my previous website, just didn't have time to do it this last year.Anyone looking for a solution just as a developer to create you a direct plugin, will cost you less than £1k and be so much better than paying these charlatansDate of experience: March 31, 2023Reply from SendcloudApr 7, 2023Hi Rob, We're very sorry to hear that you are unhappy with our services. I have reached out to you via email in order to get more details about the issues you mention here. I will be waiting for your reply in order to work towards a solution together. As for the Nominated day delivery, we are truly sorry we didn't manage to update the Dynamic checkout feature to work as you expected. We have provided a workaround a few months back to help you overcome this limitation until we implement a fix. The fact that it has not been resolved yet is due to the fact that our team prioritizes the bug/ feature open tickets according to the impact that it has on our customers. This particular feature you're mentioning is part of a very specific feature of our entire product, Dynamic Checkout.  Its use can be personalized in many ways, and just a few users that chose this limited feature would be affected by this. The development team needs to make these decisions and prioritize its work. We realize that we are, unfortunately, disappointing some of our customers by not fixing some issues as fast as they would expect. I regret that you were one of the users affected, and we couldn't fix this in time for you. Again, our sincere apologies for not having the feature fixed for you. I look forward to hearing from you in the email I've sent you.

They've got this policy where you supposedly have only seven days to report something gone missing. But here's the kicker: their system claims to allow reports up to 45 days after the last scan, which doesn't even match reality. Remember the good old days? You could open a ticket about a lost parcel anytime you wanted, as long as it was within 12 months after creating the label. That was easy and made sense. Now, it's like you're on some epic quest for impossible items — think collecting the seven dragon balls, a unicorn's blood sample, and a dragon's heart — just to get a ticket submitted. They're asking for everything under the sun: purchase invoices, sale invoices, customer confirmations, and who knows what else. Honestly, the shipping companies themselves don't even ask for half of this stuff.The whole thing about their contract supposedly giving them just seven days to report issues? Complete nonsense. They used to let you report issues whenever, as long as it was within that golden 12-month window after the label was created. It makes you wonder how they could do it before but now suddenly can't, especially when the shipping companies are still cool with the 12-month rule.So, imagine you've done your homework and corrected them on their own policy, or by some stroke of luck, your issue gets through to the shipping company on the first attempt. The shipping company might sort things out in a couple of months, but Sendcloud? They'll drag their feet and maybe, just maybe, you'll hear back from them half a year later. It's baffling.And if a customer comes out of the woodwork months later to say their package never arrived, which happens more often than you'd think, they get refunded by the marketplace, and you're left out to dry. Bring it up with Sendcloud, and you're just making their support team's life \"harder.\"We've had cases where customers reported missing items directly to the shipping company. Occasionally, Sendcloud would loop us in, but most of the time, we were left to track these issues ourselves and nag Sendcloud for updates. But god forbid you as the shipper try to get answers directly from the shipping company for a speedy resolution.It's a disastrously designed system, riddled with issues because, apparently, they don't want their customer service team to break a sweat. They want to mediate everything, but when action is required, it's always, \"Oops, sorry, can't help you there.\" And if you try handling things on your own, well, brace yourself for their backlash.Take it from a small company that's funneled around €10 million worth of shipments through them over the past two years that was banned from shipping with them because of these guidelines: proceed with caution.EDIT: Their answer is a joke. They never tried to fix anything and their policies are a joke - no wonder half the comments here complain about the policies when something goes wrong. You removed the ability to report cases within the 12 months system limit and then wanted the old cases to not be reported anymore because it was too much work for the support - yet wanted us to report them anyway through the ticket system..that was not allowing tickets for these shipments anymore? Do you guys even hear yourselves? XDDDDDo not address the random statements that we had over 300 claims open, when the truth was that it was all the same 30-50 lost parcels within the last 18 months that had 4-5 tickets open (each) because the support was not even following through properly with any of them.Closing some by mistake and asking for the same documents over and over again in other tickets. You have been provided with proof that your remark was just some random bs number.Also do not address the fact that some cases have been open for over 13 months with no moving forward, not from the carrier side but from yours..despite being reported on time.It is not possible to shift the blame on the costumer when the carrier forwards documents in July 2023 and you give them to the costumer in February 2024 and then make the costumer wait another 2 months for a payment of 510 Euro.We have some cases for which we gave all documents in January and we almost have April and still no payment in sight.I also need to mention how no insurance claim was paid out and they claimed we had to open multiple tickets for that but this was just not possible?XDDDDDDo not worry about the shipping parnter, all is good between us.The insurance denied the right claim because we used another claim as example for a technical error that did not let us report it on time. Of course, you can read their reviews on not bought websites and you will reach the same conclusion.Date of experience: February 26, 2024Reply from SendcloudMar 22, 2024Thank you for providing your insights and feedback. Your comments are valuable as we continue to refine our services to better meet our customers' needs.We understand the challenges you've encountered with the policies set by shipping carriers and the communication surrounding shipping issues. As a service provider, we must adhere to these policies set by the carriers.Regarding the blockage of your account, despite our attempts to address issues such as incorrect claim processes and delayed reporting, regrettably, we didn't observe the desired improvements, neither did your selected insurance and shipping partners. Nevertheless, we remain dedicated to assisting you and are open to further discussion to reach a resolution.Best regards,LGLeonardo Gobbato2 reviewsESOct 5, 2021Thank you! Big love from Pamuuc OrganicWe have been testing and looking around for our shipment partner to integrate to our website and there is no doubt that SendCloud is far ahead of competition, the whole onboarding experience has been very easy and stress free.

Thanks!Date of experience: October 05, 2021ARArno2 reviewsNLUpdated Oct 6, 2021Great customer serviceWhenever I have a problem or question and call sendcloud the customer support really helps you. I had a problem with UK VAT numbers and EORI numbers, and they customer service representative pointed me straight to where I could solve the problem. Every time they knew what they were talking about. I'm really happy I'm a sendcloud customer.Date of experience: October 06, 2021DODorien2 reviewsBEFeb 21, 2023App itself is greatApp itself is great, but their customer service is absolutely useless...Date of experience: February 20, 2023Reply from SendcloudFeb 22, 2023Hi Dorien,I am sorry to hear that you are dissatisfied with our service and are still waiting for the delivery of one of your shipments. I understood from my colleague that you have spoken to each other. We have therefore just made another report to the carrier and asked them to deliver your shipment as soon as possible.We are completely dependent on the carrier's investigation and response regarding undelivered parcels. We obviously try to make this happen as soon as possible by asking for regular updates, but unfortunately, due to busy times, it can take a bit longer.When we have received an update from the carrier regarding your package, we will of course contact you immediately.My sincere apologies for the inconvenience!- RowieCECeline2 reviewsBEOct 6, 2021Essential tool for running an online storeSendcloud is a great tool for people with an online store.

First, I was getting significantly overcharged on shipping and storage fees due to very incorrect measurements. Luckily I caught this and was reimbursed. Second, they are very late on shipping orders (10+ days on some orders at the moment). They are going on I understand that it is \"cyber week\", but I think orders that are 8+ days late is overkill.  We open tickets every single day for these unshipped orders and they still will not take care of it. They also lost some of my inventory,  and they did reimburse me for which I am very thankful for.  Other than that, the efficiency is good with shipping. The mistakes on the skus being shipped out incorrectly has been less than 1%.Date of experience: December 02, 2022Reply from ShipHeroDec 7, 2022Hello Brandi,Thank you for taking the time to let us know about the challenges you're facing.

I've provided feedback but simply put, tickets are taking way too long to be resolved. If someone has a question about a basic functionality then Tier 1 is pretty good at tackling that quickly. The issue is that the second it is anything beyond that or a bug in the system, we're looking at weeks, months, and I literally had a ticket that was a year old that just got responded to. Having your own warehouses, you should know that a bug can bring everything to a complete halt. There just doesn't seem to be a proper QA process in place before code deployments and many times when new features are released, no one knows anything about it. I know there will always be little bugs and glitches from time to time, that's software, but I'd say we report bugs every other day. For those tickets to take 2+ weeks for a resolution (only after I rummage through my email to try and get another ShipHero email contact) is just unacceptable. With that being said, once I did finally get in touch with someone to get this escalated we got the type of service and promptness that we would expect.Date of experience: June 08, 2023KAKali1 reviewUSNov 24, 2023Tolya was very quick to respond to my…Tolya was very quick to respond to my request, especially on a day after a holiday (Black Friday).

The later half of 2022 their support went away, shipping times rockets to weeks. I still have to hawkishly monitor packages that still can take 10 days to ship out. If i am using them as a service shouldn't they monitor packages having now gone out in 10 days? This seems super basic. Not only that they have hidden pricing, they advertise no hidden fees but buckle up there are. They add surcharges for fuel and destination. I have asked them is there a predictable way to calculate shipping and the flat answer is \"no\". I have had items that weigh 1 pound be charged for 2 pounds. How in the world is there another pound added? Finally what might be the last straw, they are now charging a $500 a month tech fee for using their platform which is incredibly slow and performs terribly when searching for anything on their platform. Please do not use shiphero it will only be a constant headache when you should be running your business. It really is sad that I am going to leave but it is for the best.One thing I would like to add, is that all of these positive reviews they position to customers after a customer support person helped them with their problem and ask them to be reviewed there. They do not ask to be reviewed after every case. So all of these reports are really not representative of the service shiphero really providesDate of experience: June 11, 2023RARanvi1 reviewPHJul 20, 2023The team is very helpfulThe team is very helpful, especially Fernanda Sanmiguel!

We have 3 national magazines, and we were scammed by this company. Our new magazine printer used them to do foreign mailing. They've had our magazines for TWO MONTHS that were to ship immediately and said they're sitting in a warehouse in NJ for 8 weeks. Now they are REFUSING to return our products so we can ship it with a different company. They were supposed to mail them upon receipt, and they say they're waiting until January 20th when they've had them since mid-November. For one of the three magazines they received Nov 9th, they say it shipped 3 weeks ago but will not produce one receipt of mailing/customs/documentation when not one single customer received any product. Two months and 20+ emails later, they either don't respond or offer no proof of mailing. We're having to get an attorney in NY this week to try to recover our stolen products that were never shipped and obtain a refund. We're also filing a complaint with the state of NY and NJ. We paid a 50% above-market rate for international shipping in November, and they have never shipped.We're overwhelmed with refund requests and reports to the BBB because people think we never mailed their items, and Shiphero has no proof of mailing. It ruined my annual Christmas vacation with my family. 1. They take your product that is supposed to ship immediately.2. They keep the product and refuse to return it after they haven't mailed it for 2 months.3. If they say anything has been mailed, after 4 weeks of emails, you'll have no documentation.4. The product never arrives.5. You have to refund your clients 6. Your reputation is destroyed, and thousands are lost in revenue. In case they try to make Trustpilot take this review down, the names of the magazines are ORIGIN, THRIVE, and Mantra Wellness, which are in every grocery chain nationally (US). If you are also having a nightmare experience with this company, we have full legal documentation of this process we can send you to show they operate like scam artists. File a complaint, get your credit card to refund you, and report this company if this has happened to you. The damage they're currently causing us in sales, stress, and time is immense.Date of experience: December 27, 2023SASam1 reviewCAApr 16, 2024Carlos has been amazing in assisting…Carlos has been amazing in assisting our team with an ongoing issue we encountered.

THEY TOOK ALL MY INFORMATION (ADRESS +  PAYMENT+ CREDIT CARD) AND SAID THEY NEED MY ID PHOTO TO CONTINUE. THIS WEBSITE IS GATHERING YOUR INFORMATION. STAY AWAY FROM THEM.Date of experience: April 12, 2022Reply from ShippoUpdated Apr 15, 2022Hi Habip, Thanks for leaving us a review. Here at Shippo, we do what we can to ensure that our users are protected as much as possible from potential financial or shipping fraud. Since your first label purchase was over $100, we requested for a photo ID to help verify your identity since that’s a fraud block that we have in place. The system we use to have photo IDs submitted is secure and once the ID is submitted, it's completely erased meaning we do not store this information. Also, the $25 charge that you had seen was a pre-authorization charge that’s applied when a first label attempt is made. That said, we went ahead and canceled the hold since the label you attempted to make error’d out. We hope you understand these security measures we have in place to protect our users from fraud, and we hope to see you around on Shippo in the future.Thank you,Shippo SupportMMmohamed moussa4 reviewsSAMay 1, 2023fraudulent UPS labels overcharges.i am using them for UPS labels, ALWAYS a more charge is applied to the shipments although i have the ups receipt weight and package dimensions.really a nasty behavior, i moved from them and never had this issue again.Date of experience: May 01, 2023Jordan Butler12 reviewsUSJul 8, 2022Illegal Insurance ProgramBeen using them fine for over a year. Had to file my first insurance claim. My buyer had requested a refund from the platform we used for our transaction. My buyer got refunded immediately. As the item was damaged in transit I couldn't win my appeal. As he got paid, he didn't need me anymore and the platform closed conversations between the two of us. Shippo's insurance department creates a system of small fine prints that NEVER get you to get a claim approved. For starters, they require the involvement of your buyer which is nothing that your buyer ever agreed upon so legally, that's a breach of their own contracting. Then they added on random requirements for my first emailed list of requirements did not have a repair estimate nor have I ever heard of such a requirement nor is it in their own policies or terms of the agreement.  Lastly, they told me basically 'tough ****' when I stated my buyer was not cooperating. Do yourself a favor and find anyone else when dealing with shopping insurance.Date of experience: July 08, 2022Shawn Hutchinson3 reviewsUSJun 3, 2024Shippo Well we used Shippo all the time.

Thank you!Date of experience: October 20, 2021K M2 reviewsUSUpdated Sep 9, 2023Consistent Billing issuesConsistent Billing issues, literally zero customer service and they even ended the live chat option its email only now!!!! The most recent issue is a string of 11 Identical service adjustments \"Change in service level to PM\" USPS apparently identified some of these charges as in error (duh!) and refunded 5 of 11 but Shippo is making me jump through all kinds of hoops to get them to even look at the other 6... I have been emailing executives at the company now with little response... It is clear this company is in a death spiral and should be avoided. Its a shame I have shipped nearly 5,000 packages with them in 2 years...Update: after getting stonewalled for several days I took it upon myself to reach out to employees through 'other' means to ensure I received my refunds. I was able to be enough of a squeaky wheel I did get my refunds but it wasn't easy and was probably the worst customer service experience I have ever had. I simply cant trust them moving forward and they lost my business which spends more than 30k annually on shipping.

I don't even know anyone in Illinois. Is it Shippo's fault? Maybe? I don't know because there is no chat or phone number to call. I went straight to UPS. They zeroed out the invoice and are cancelling the account number for me. Will never use this service again. There is also no human available to help. One thing in their favor is that the cancellation process was fairly straight forward.Edit: Turns out UPS couldn't cancel the account because it was created by Shippo. I cancelled my Shippo account, and hopefully that will be the end of the matter. Next time I think I'll just go to the UPS store.Date of experience: August 17, 2022Reply from ShippoAug 30, 2022Hi there,Thanks for leaving us a review.

Our first encounter was a serious disappointment when UPS misplaced an ebike and refused to refund the shipping label that we purchased for $1063. While Shippo managed to obtain a refund for the label after persistent follow-ups spanning 2 1/2 months, the lost ebike, valued over $1500, was never recovered, leading to a substantial financial setback for us.This brings me to our second encounter. On 08/01/2023, we parted with $570.24 (as per Shippo Invoice #216068664) for an ebike shipment to Hawaii. To our dismay, UPS returned it on the very same day, claiming an inability to deliver to Hawaii, and assured a FULL refund. Our interactions with Shippo led to a mere credit of $530 (Shippo Invoice #223809100), leaving a discrepancy of $40.24 from the original cost. To add salt to the wound, an inexplicable additional charge of $262.87 was levied (Shippo Invoice #223808846).The pattern and these encounters paint a concerning picture of Shippo's operations. Their practices seem to border on the unscrupulous, leaving customers in the lurch. Use their services with utmost caution.Date of experience: August 01, 2023DCDeborah C2 reviewsUSOct 20, 2021InvitedSAVINGS!Ease of sign up, ease of use, SAVINGS, very helpful for small businesses shipping packages.

Most of the time UPS meets our criteria the most. We ship out long boxes but keep them under the UPS max length of 108\".   We recently are getting hit with $1026.00 length exceeded charges for UPS shipments that are routinely costing <$100.  We are now up to $3078 in charges - the most recent one proves this is erroneous.  I received the $1026 charge for the overage, it is only 70\" long AND THE PACKAGE HAS NOT EVEN BEEN PICKED UP YET - HOW DOES THAT WORK?!?!?!?  And, there is no live body to contact at Shippo to remedy this.   We now know that this is NOT a UPS initiated charge because UPS hasn't even gotten the package yet. How are we to avoid this when we are clearly within the shipping limits of the packaging and still getting hit for $1000+ charges 10x+ over the shipping cost. here is the receipt details....Invoice No.: 85659973 3/22/2022 LABEL_PAYMENT UPS 1ZX6306F0394097860  $54.413/22/2022 LABEL_SURCHARGEUPS 1ZX6306F0390949045 (Shipping Charge Correction Over Maximum Length)$1,026.00Subtotal\t$1,080.41Total\t$1,080.41Here is my phone number if anyone in ShippoDate of experience: March 23, 2022Reply from ShippoMar 24, 2022Hi Matt, Thank you for leaving this review and we're very sorry to hear about the issues you've been coming across with your shipments.

We understand how frustrating unexpected surcharges can be, and want to assure you that we’re here to help. It’s important to note that surcharges are passed directly from the carrier and are out of Shippo’s control. Carriers have highly calibrated technology in place to weigh, measure, and audit shipments as they travel through the carrier’s system. These systems detect a multitude of dimensions, including if a package is overweight, irregular in size, and/or bulging in any way. These machines are extremely accurate. We’re more than happy to look into your package and see what happened here. Unfortunately, we weren't able to locate your account information based on your review name. To assist you further, please feel free to reach out to us at support@shippo.com.Thanks,Shippo SupportRORoxanne1 reviewUSOct 27, 2021InvitedGreat tool for small businesses and…Great tool for small businesses and entrepreneurs to save on shipping.

After you contact support they tell you your account was flagged for security reasons. This is not actually true. They are doing this to all new users. But they make you feel like you are suspicious.The support team will tell you you must provide a verifiable photo ID (driver license, passport etc.) in order to unlock your account.They will tell you they do this to keep their customers safe.I asked SHIPPO support and privacy team basic information about how they can ensure me that my personal information is safe, what data they keep on record from my ID, and how long they keep my data for.The support and privacy team took 3 weeks to respond to me and they ignored my questions and simply told me they need to ID to keep customers safe and I don't have to be a customer if I don't want to be.Dear Shippo,Trust is a two way street.If you want my ID to keep your customers safe,Then you need to offer me some safety assurances around what you are doing with my personal data.For all we know SHIPPO is selling your ID's on the black market. Their privacy statement mentions absolutely nothing about collecting user ID's nor what they do with the personal data.Stay aware from this company if you do not want your identity stolen.EDIT: IN RESPONSE TO SHIPPO REPLYFirstly, I created two accounts and both were flagged to provide photo ID before ANY order were made. The comment from Shippo saying labels created over $100 get flagged is no true.Secondly, after the many weeks of emailing, the response from Shippo here is the first time I have been advised that ID's are not stored.Date of experience: April 19, 2022Reply from ShippoApr 25, 2022Hi Matthew,Thanks for leaving us a review. Here at Shippo, we do what we can to ensure that our users are protected as much as possible from potential financial or shipping fraud. We have different fraud blocks in place (for instance, first label purchase being over $100) that trigger a request for a photo ID to help verify your identity. The system we use to have photo IDs submitted is secure and once the ID is submitted, it's completely erased meaning we do not store this information. We hope you understand these security measures we have in place to protect our users from fraud, and we hope to see you around on Shippo in the future.Thank you,Shippo SupportEMEmily2 reviewsUSOct 27, 2021InvitedShippo delivers... everything!I have had the pleasure to work in the same office as the people of Shippo, the professionalism and excitement, the commitment to service comes through in everything they do!Date of experience: October 27, 2021LPLotus Pearls Creations1 reviewUSOct 27, 2021InvitedI love shippoI love shippo, it’s inexpensive and efficient.

Easy to use, discounted shipping labels.  Print at home.  Very happy with service.Date of experience: October 27, 2021flying dragon car1 reviewUSUpdated Sep 10, 2023surcharges and overbilling on my labelI am being double charged via their surcharges as other reviews have mentioned. I have no problem with being charged the correct amount. But don't charge me for a label at the time of shipping and then charge the full amount again plus the overage at a later date. That is effectively double charging. Example: I shipped a USPS priority shipping label that was 1.2lbs. I was charged $10.07. I days later got charged $11.35 because shippo said it was 1.3lbs. This is total is $22.42. I went back and wanted to see how much it would cost to reship the same parcel using their corrected weight and guess what ? The charge was only $10.07. Where did the first $10.07 go ? The other reviewers are correct. They will hit you with surcharges later and overcharge you. Back to ship station I go.Update 9/10I got a customer service email this morning explaining to me what a surcharge is ( as if I don't know ) and how if I wanted a refund I would need to dispute it with USPS. )  Which has nothing to do with my issue of shippo DOUBLE billing me for the same label! Charging me 10.07 at the time of print and  11.35 , (2) days later which they say is the TOTAL correct amount. Meaning I was charged 22.42 in all for a box that should only be 11.35 by their own words!!!! This is nothing but frustration.  I really should have stayed with shipstation.Date of experience: September 06, 2023Previous156715Next pageCompany activitySee allClaimed profilePays for extra featuresReplied to 61% of negative reviewsReplies to negative reviews in > 1 monthShippoInformation written by the companyDeliver by design — at every stage of ecommerce complexity.Shippo works with the tools you already use to power shipping capabilities once exclusively reserved for retail giants.

A week ago they wiped out our account of our orders, order history, manual orders, etc, we can login but cannot see anything in our account. Every help request we opened was automatically closed. They said they could not charge our card on file, and they don't let us access our payment info page to update the card with another card, they also don't let us look up tracking information of our manually created orders in the past. They also completely deleted our stamps.com account. Full dissatisfaction that we have never experienced before. We have now moved to Shippo, and we have so much easier shipping work-flow. We regret staying with Shipstation for so long and we are thankful for this eye-opening experience so that we can get out of this tragic horror Ship station ran by robotic and careless machine.Date of experience: December 07, 2023BOBob5 reviewsUSUpdated Mar 31, 2021Great software. Massively hidden human support.The ShipStation software is excellent, streamlining shipping decisions and operations to the point where it becomes indispensable. We count it as one of the best decisions we've made.But if you run into an urgent problem with a shipment, good luck with that. You'll be forced to \"peruse\" their knowledge library and interact with an automated chatbot instead of a human or an e-mail address. Find a phone # on Google? A voicemail will tell you to do all the above or send an email to \"help.shipstation.com\" and then will hang up on you. The address they give is clearly not a valid e-mail, but surprisingly neither is help AT shipstation.com.When you finally do get to a human, that person will do a great job. Just expect 45 minutes to get there.Date of experience: March 31, 2021Reply from ShipStationApr 8, 2021Hi Bob,Many thanks for your feedback - it's great to hear that the software is making a real difference in you business.We'd like to learn about the challenges you had contacting the support team, so if you're happy to provide more detail, please email us on reviews@shipstation.com.

I had to contact Ship Station support to correct the situation. I won't use them anymore.

In the last two days our customers have experienced a situation where the calculated shipping cost constantly changes preventing them from completing the order. We have lost numerous sales in the last few days. We contacted Ship Station Support and received no help. I mentioned in the \"Chat\" page that I might have to use one of their competitors if i can't get this situation resolved and was informed that I might try to contact Support next week. I decided to open an account with Shippo. Customer Service is important for our customer base and we go to great lengths to make sure our Customers are satisfied. Ship Station Customer Support goes to great lengths to see that their customer base is dis-satisfied.Date of experience: February 09, 2024AdvertisementEHEvan Hutchings3 reviewsUSJul 12, 2022I urge you to avoid Ship StationI could write a long winded email on how bad ship station is and the amount of issues we have had since testing the solution.The support is non existent with a lot of \"support\" personnel working from home still.You can stay in a queue on live chat for hours or get your emails ignored.I urge you to avoid this company.

If you use ShipStation to ship a single item through PayPal you will be automatically enrolled in their service. It will take repeated emails to unsubscribe from the service and I have yet to receive a refund. PayPal has your credit card info so you are a sitting duck. Although ShipStation is a subsidiary of PayPal, they disavow any responsibility and their links to SS are broken. Another PayPal scheme to fleece unknowing users via one of their subsidiaries! Use USPS/UPS/FedEx direct!Date of experience: November 17, 2021Reply from ShipStationNov 26, 2021Hi,Thanks for leaving your feedback.

The customer service on Shipstation is terrible.  I have had an issue with two UPS claims that should have been resolved weeks ago.  I was told it would be resolved within 8-10 business days. After 10 businesses days, I followed up with Shipstation every day via email (they do not offer customer support via phone) and I did not receive a response until 8 days later.  I would expect at least some kind of response within 3 days.  8 days is unacceptable, and the worst part is, my issue still has not been resolved, and it's been over a month since I submitted my two claims.Date of experience: July 06, 2022Reply from ShipStationJul 13, 2022Hi Tracy,Thanks for the feedback.

I was home at the time the package was supposedly delivered. They suggested I check with my neighbors; I did they do not have package.  Told that UPS sometimes scans packages as delivered and they show up days later.  Contacted UPS to start investigation as to where the package is.  No communication from shipper as of today 12/6/22.Date of experience: December 03, 2022ASAndy Sugden1 reviewGBMar 23, 2023TERRIBLE SERVICE - DO NOT USE!I moved to ShipStation thinking that using the service would make my life easier... what a mistake that was! Setup was easy enough, however since then we constantly get errors or things going wrong with the import of our orders from Shopify (e.g. the weights not being imported correctly, the addresses not being imported correctly). This means we then have to check and amend all the orders manually each day giving us more work to do than we'd started with!CUSTOMER SERVICES IS USELESS! We've contacted the customer service team asking them to fix the bugs/glitches in their system, but so far they haven't. They are slow to respond (3-4 days is typical) and when they do respond they rarely provide any useful information or a fix to the problem.I wish we'd never started with ShipStation. If you're considering using them then my strong advice is to avoid!Date of experience: March 23, 2023KBK B1 reviewUSUpdated Sep 21, 2022Used to be a great solutionUsed to be a great solution, has steadily gone downhill.

See below telling me to email them. I hear to say, I emailed them and guess what no response. See the company wants to appear they care, but they don't. Maybe instead of have people comment on the reviews people leave they should use that time to respond to there customers.

We were promised the world, in reality, what happened was we had many orders duplicated, no real answers to why that was and a loss amounting to literally thousands of pounds.

My issue is that it will not download some of the orders from eBay. Out of 50 orders, it will not download 10 or 12 orders . I contacted them and they supposely expedited to their Senior Supporters. You get zero communication from them or if they are trying to fix it or not. We have been using it for three years and have tried every trick we know to get working but to no avail. The true pain is that we have to enter these orders manually every day. All you get are canned responses.Date of experience: October 31, 2022MCMulti Clever Trade1 reviewUSJan 31, 2023STEER CLEAR - They have billed me $8,700 in 5 days....I am the owner of Multi Clever Trade, a women's clothing we send out around 2K packages a month and i can tell you AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This company has billed me $8,700 in the 5 days of use. There is absolutely no accountability on their side or even transparency what this money is charged for. This is literal robbery on all accounts. There is no indication of how much each order printed through them costs us and why this is what we were billed. It is physically impossible for us to have sent out that many packages, their billing system is disastrous. STEER CLEAR . Shipstation i would advise you to reach out to our account and fix this.

I repeatedly requested help with integrating my USPS label creation system via API, but the support agent seemed completely unable to understand my issue. Despite asking several times to escalate my request to the developer team for API integration support, I kept receiving irrelevant responses about connecting my USPS account through the UI, which I had clearly stated was not what I needed.It felt like my requests were either not being read properly or deliberately ignored, and I spent far too much time repeating myself with no progress. Even after threatening to leave a negative review, I still didn’t receive the help I needed. If ShipStation cannot provide the support for technical integration that they claim to offer, they should at least have agents who can escalate issues properly. Very disappointed with the service.Date of experience: August 15, 2024NANan6 reviewsUSJun 13, 2022Worst experience ever trying to print…Worst experience ever trying to print labels to Canada and my labels had no errors.

They are unresponsive, lack knowledge, and always point their finger at someone else as the root cause of the issue, even when it ultimately comes down to their poorly written software.Their software is not updated in a timely manner, so when Shopify makes an update , ShipStation no longer works and you are sitting waiting for 6+ months for them to actually fix it so that you can get orders out without the fear that things are not going to work.Date of experience: July 13, 2023BSBrian Sklar4 reviewsUSJan 12, 2024Secret Seduction Spray fails to do as promised…I ordered the Secret Seduction Spray on Oct. 3, 2023 and when it finally came (several weeks later) there were 2 spray containers, a very small one (which was empty) and a larger one which was only partially filled.  On Jan. 12,2024 I sent them an email telling them about the problem with the 2 containers and that the spray had no effect on my wife.  When I asked them for a refund they said that I had already exceeded the 60 day money back guarantee so there would be no refund.  They did not offer to send any replacement for the empty and partially filled containers.  This is a company that can't be trusted.

We suggest our users re-tap the location button and share the updated what3words address. Feel free to get in touch with us at support@what3words.com for more info.- NayaShaun Middleton4 reviewsGBUpdated Feb 3, 2023Points to wrong house. EDIT fixed with help from app support.Points to the wrong house and some delivery drivers seem to believe it.EDIT: Great communications from what3words helped me fix this problem by suggesting an edit on Google maps. This has been sucessful.Date of experience: January 28, 2023Reply from what3wordsJan 30, 2023Hi Shaun,We are sorry for the confusion. I hope to clear it up for you. The what3words app uses Apple maps, and Google Maps to find what3words address of any street address. Seldomly, some locations can be inaccurate on these maps which would reflect on the what3words app. To get the correct what3words address for your home, please tap on the square that best locates your house i.e. a front door. Then you can share that what3words address to get your parcel exactly where you want. Also, you can report correct address using these links - https://support.google.com/maps/answer/3094088?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en (Google Maps) and https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203080 (Apple Maps).

This usually happens when the GPS signal of the device being used is weak, which can happen if you’re in a building or in a location where your line of sight to the sky is obstructed.

A magnetic sensor is required to use the compass (when pressing Navigate > Compass) so that error is either fired when the component in the phone is having issues/or is not there, so please contact your device's support team to get assistance diagnosing that. It is worth mentioning that you can use other navigation apps to get directions to what3words address. For more help, please feel free to get in touch with us at support@what3words.com.

In my business, I have a number of staff on the road who visit anything from a very rural property to a very large business premises.Our policy now is that whenever any member of staff visits any property that was slightly difficult to locate, we ALWAYS grab the What3Words reference and enter it onto our customer database so that it helps EVERYBODY else in the company.We have situations whereby an emergency job can come in overnight and the person visiting that remote property could have previously spent a considerable amount of time driving around the area because the postcode was too generic and mobile phone reception too poor to call the person for location guidance.This app TOTALLY solves this problem and all of the team in my business love it.I am so pleased that all of the emergency services around the UK are adopting its use. Yes, you can get Lat/Long readings from Google Maps but 3 simple words is so much easier and superior to an old fashioned bunch of random numbers.Date of experience: July 03, 2021Aitch6 reviewsGBJun 12, 2023Great System.I’ve been very pleased with What 3 Words, using it in conjunction with my motorcycle navigation system.

When her ashes were scattered I was self-isolating for an operation, and so I missed that opportunity to say goodbye. My mum noted down the w3w location for me to be able to pay my respects quietly once that was done. However, what she noted down wasn't quite right and placed me a few hundred miles off the west coast of Africa. I figured I could take what she noted down and find the nearest spot with a similar w3w location given how it's supposed to be unique and words spread out. NOPE. There's no way of looking at a close map with the squares labelled. It would be easy for them to do but the company, being a for-profit company, don't want to provide such functionality as it could eat into their business model. And as a result it took me 8 months to manage to get my elderly mother and I to the rough location and try and piece together the right place from the photos she took on the day, and there's no guarantee that we found it.The idea behind it is ok but being privately operated and a closed system with a wordlist full of homophones and plurals means that what their PR machine tries to convey is pretty far from not being able to say a final goodbye to your grandmother.Date of experience: April 27, 2022Reply from what3wordsMay 6, 2022Hi Steve,We're sorry to hear about your loss and experience using what3words. I can understand your frustration and I will pass on your feedback about being able to view what3words addresses in a smaller area. I'd like to assure you that this wasn't an intentional business decision and we're happy to take customer feedback on board.We've tried to ensure similar sounding addresses are placed further apart to avoid any confusion in smaller areas, this helps us to be more accurate.Please do get in touch with our customer support team at support@what3words.com to see if we can help find the what3words address your mum had written down.Thank you, what3wordsRERoger Ellman1 reviewUSJul 2, 2021Fun to use and oh so accurate locatorFun to use and oh so accurate way of guiding people to events and meetings.

What if one of your family members went camping and you had them give you their 3 word location once they set up camp.  Say bad weather goes through the area and they loose cell service completely.  You get concerned and travel to their location.  You will be able to find them within 10 ft. Of where they pitched their tent.  Very cool.

We found (and just rechecked) our W3W address on your website using a desktop computer.  Just asked the same friends to find W3W a...c...s... on their W3W mobile App.  It's our front entrance... Maybe the W3W app only works in fine weather? ENDS.  We gave friends clear instructions to find our house in France, but as it was dark and raining, they said they would prefer to drive to the nearest town and then use the What3Words map reference.  W3W took them to a built-up area about 5 km from our rural location.  They then spent a further 30 mins searching for our home, eventually resorting to Google Maps (which is what they should have used in the first place).  I wrote to W3W 21 October asking for an explanation, received an auto reply, then chased them on 17 Dec.  This morning (27 Dec) finally ... oh no, just another auto-reply in my inbox. Don't suppose I'll ever find out what went wrong, but I'd never trust W3W again.Date of experience: October 19, 2022Reply from what3wordsDec 30, 2022Hi there,We are sorry for the inconvenience. I hope to explain what might have happened. Can I ask how you got the what3words address you shared with your friend - did you use the location view button or search with the street address? Because when viewing your what3words address, the GPS signal of the device is used to determine the location. And this signal can be distorted indoors or when the view of the skyline is obstructed. But this can be rectified by tapping on the location button couple more times and waiting for a while. If you found the what3words address by searching with street address, we simply converted the GPS coordinates of that address to what3words address. We suggest reporting the correct location to Google Maps and Apple Maps and using the satellite view to tap on the correct square to get the correct 3 word address. I hope this makes sense as to why the what3words address you used was wrong and now you can find the correct one. For more help, don't hesitate to get in touch with us at support@what3words.com. Thank you. - NayaKDKen Doerr3 reviewsGBJul 2, 2021The best thing since GPSIf you haven't used this yet you are in for a treat: NEVER get lost again. Plan journeys with confidence.

Of the times Amazon used Intelcom, 80% of packages \"couldn't be delivered\", yet somehow Amazon drivers and the mail arrives without difficulty. This last delivery says an \"attempt” was made while I was at home, and that there was some \"problem with the address\", which is, naturally, unspecified. I check their website which says to call them. On doing so, the message says they won't answer due to \"circumstances beyond their control\" and hangs up. The next day, I called again and their automated system tells me my call will be answered within 50 minutes, with no automated call back. Being a normal person with a life, and valuing my sanity, there was no way I was going to tie up my life for an hour or more for an Amazon delivery. My previous experiences have shown photos of deliveries to the wrong building 5 km away, and attempts been made in the wrong city. This company should be thrown into the sun.

No help whatsoever, they just use the same tracking as what I already have access to.

Last one, I paid to Amazon for returning an item bought due to missing out on some small print in the item's description. Amazon assured me that Intelcom would come and pick the item, and only after that the refund would be processed. Guess what - 4 days in a row Intelcom wrote that the driver is coming ... and no-one came, time and again. Lies are what they excel at.Date of experience: August 03, 2023CUcustomer6 reviewsCAUpdated Dec 2, 2023No respect for the customer's timeI cannot believe that this company keeps me the entire day in the house for a pickup.

We have a very obvious address in a suburban area, have delivers all the time from other companies with no issue.  This company lies and then refuses to explain their actions.If you have no intention of delivering a package, then WHY ARE YOU IN THE BUSINESS OF MAKING DELIVERIES?Claims they tried to deliver ( no information what failed), then claim the address is incorrect and the claim the package is damaged.Useless company and useless customer service.

Their email communication gives you a three hour window with the drivers first name which sounds good. The driver seemed to ignore this fact when he was late and challenged my statement that I had an email regarding this and that he had 7 hours to deliver. When I showed him the company email, the driver claimed that I was harassing him and just left without the package.  I have now rescheduled the pickup twice but it seems that they have run out of time to deliver each time and request that I reschedule. This, of course after sending an email each time saying that the driver with a first name \"\"XX\" would pick up the return within 3 hours. The customer service person indicated that the claim had a \"harassed driver\" comment placed on the ticket. I find this outrageous and will no longer be using Intelcom for any returns.Date of experience: March 08, 2024ALAllan2 reviewsCAMay 6, 2023Constant non delivery.Over the last month I have had to get rebates on 7 orders from Amazon. All due to Intelcom not delivering. Today I checked my tracking for an amazon order. I looked on their site and it said delivery by Intelcom so I thought I may as well get a rebate now as it will not get here at all. Put the tracking number on Intelcom tracking site and told no such number. Tracking says it left the Richmond site early this morning so how can the tracking number be wrong. There is something seriously wrong with the Richmond site. Posted on our abbotsford  nextdoor site and suddenly found out about over 50 orders for people not delivered. I keep telling Amazon not to use Intelcom but nothing happens.Date of experience: May 05, 2023JUJulie1 reviewCANov 30, 2023This company doesn't follow directions…This company doesn't follow directions for delivery, they don't update there tracking.

IntelcomAll the reviews 99.9% of them are correct. Here and there a couple of them could be lucky in getting the timey service from this Intelcom Courier. Guess they must be those lucky lottery winners. Customer service representative/'s are absolutely rude and bearWoW no professional ethics. Wonder how global companies like Amazon still patronize them. Read somehere that they have 60 locations accross Canada and deliver 500,000 packages everyday. Should make a corretion as NON DELIVERED. Wish I could get the Intelcom chief's telephone # to express my greatly dis-satisfied opinion and surprises me that how they could be opearting from 1986. Being business man I realized today one do not have to be good in their practice of business as example set by Intelcom. LOL Intelcom must be looking for an AI developer to scam more and mislead as many as they can. Hope big companies will visit Trustpilot to read people's review to bank on Intelcom for thier deliveries. I will definitely make sure that I will not use them and also request my shipment not to be handed to Intelcom.Date of experience: April 18, 2024FPFelipe Pinto1 reviewCADec 8, 2022One of the worst services I've ever usedOne of the worst services I've ever used in my entire life. I selected their services to return a package from Amazon and after creating 2 return IDs and more than 5 attempts that no driver showed up I gave up. I've tried to call them but after waiting for 1 hour I've also given up. Their website support form does not work as well and when I try to reschedule I also keep receiving that my next pickup date is in the past. Yes, in the past. Today, 2022-12-08 I've just received an email telling me: \"Your pickup is scheduled for December 3rd 2022.\". This is unacceptable. Avoid using their services and will save you headaches and time.Date of experience: December 08, 2022Harlan Thomas1 reviewCAJul 10, 2023What a joke!Is this company real, I have waited 3 days past the due date for my package to arrive.

I tracked it again on the delivery day and saw that the delivery was \"delayed until 8 pm\". Needless to say the package was never delivered. Today is day three and Intelcom is MIA.I have also waited on them for two days for a pickup in the past and they never showed up.I cannot understand why Amazon keeps using Intelcom!! Anyone else would be better!Luckily I'm only at this address part-time and avoid ordering anything from Amazon while I'm here.Date of experience: May 25, 2023Ashley Sonnenburg1 reviewCAJan 30, 2024Such an unprofessional companyFor the most part I haven't had many issues with the driver that delivers for my area, however today I had a scheduled pick up for a return. I got two notifications that they were on their way and they'd pick up before 9pm tonight. However at 11am my tracking went from on our way to postponed without any explanation or someone even attempting to pick up the package as I was sitting in my den across from the front door the whole time as to not miss them. I find this VERY unprofessional to just postpone a pick up without giving any explanation as to why, especially when it's only 11am and it says I have until 9 pm for them to pick up.Date of experience: January 30, 2024Brittany Tokaruk1 reviewCAMar 1, 2023The absolute worst company I have ever…The absolute worst company I have ever dealt with. They lie saying they delivered the package when they have not. I have been waiting for my package for 5 days, tomorrow will be six. Everyday they say they attempted delivery when they have not. Customer service is absolutely useless and all they do to \"help\" is assure the package will be delivered the next day. I have to cancel my order because it is not being delivered and I spent a lot of money on it. Most unprofessional company there is.Date of experience: February 17, 2023DMDonna MacArthur1 reviewCAApr 3, 2024Property DamageI do not recommend using this company!  Had a delivery of an Amazon package March 16th by Intelcom.  The driver somehow managed to drive into my garage door.  After a call to Intelcom, I was sent a property damage investigation report.  That actually gave me hope that they would take responsibility for the accident and compensate me for the damage.  I discovered that they use independent drivers, not Intelcom employees to make the deliveries.  So it became the driver’s responsibility to pay for the damage.  The driver is a student with very little money.  The driver paid the cost of repairing the door, so it now functions, but it is left with several dents.  The dents can’t be repaired, the only remedy is to replace the door at a cost of $2600.00.  The driver can’t pay, Intelcom won’t pay.  I have the choice of going through my own insurance and pay a $1500 deductible or live with a damaged door.Date of experience: March 16, 2024LTlynne Taylor3 reviewsCANov 28, 2023Intelcom is the worstIntelcom is the worst, Amazon needs to get rid of them. they always send messages saying your package is coming within the next 3 hours and it does not show up, or it says arriving by 8 pm and it does not, and if you are really lucky does not show up at all, they just do not care, one time my package stayed outside in the rain overnight and everything was damaged, I couldn't stay up longer to wait as I wake up at 4 in the morning for work. Every time when I see it will be intelcom who is delivering I do not know what to expect anymore because they are unreliable.Date of experience: November 27, 2023JAJoe Abboud2 reviewsCADec 24, 2023Itelcom lost my package by their own…Itelcom lost my package by their own admission. I have an email that showed they have my package, then it was picked up by the wrong driver to deliver. And between the warehouse and the wrong driver, Itelcom lost it. I contacted customer service  every day for 5 days because they kept promising that the package is on its way, but it never came. So I contacted Amazon and they refunded me. So, my last contact with Itelcom customer service, I got agent Axel, If you get this agent, I recommend you hang up an call again. Axel is rude and has no knowledge of what’s going on. He reads you a scripted paragraph and hopes you leave, but if you ask him a question, he puts you on mute (not hold) he mutes his phone and wait for you to hung up. I will complain to Amazon and recommend they stop using Itelcom services.Date of experience: December 23, 2023BLBarry Love3 reviewsCAAug 20, 2024Incredibly the worst delivery company…Incredibly the worst delivery company ever, can't even deliver a package on time ever, and amazon uses them as there go to delivery company. They are an unreliable company with horrible service. Date of experience: August 19, 2024Daemon Can1 reviewCAJun 29, 2024Need to update their technology.Organization claims to be a technology company that just happens to deliver packages.  If this were true, they would have live tracking of deliveries, and far more accurate delivery estimates.  They would also be able to tell when an address is a business and attempt delivery after 5 PM (or 7PM, or 9PM), and despite claims that \"Every delivery is optimized in real time\" a driver is not even capable of informing dispatch that the destination is a business.  Not efficient from a manpower & resource perspective.Date of experience: June 28, 2024GT1 reviewCAJul 21, 2024Amazon package delivered to wrong address. They don't want to fix it!My Amazon delivery was for Fri. July 19th.  I received an email saying my parcel had been delivered.  The photo of proof of delivery on the bottom of the email showed it was delivered to the wrong address.  I called the number on the website immediately.  I was on hold for a good 1/2 hour before a rep answered.  I was told I should receive a phone within 24 hrs. with an  update.  I didn't receive a call by Sunday so I called them again.  The rep said that if I hadn't received my package within 48 hrs. I had to call Amazon. I told them it didn't make sense to me.  This wasn't Amazon's fault, it was theirs.  Why can't they send the driver back to the wrong address, pick up my package and deliver it to me?  The rep read off the same 'canned' explanation.  I asked if there had been an attempt to retrieve my package and the rep again stated that if it was unretrieveable to call Amazon.  This company has no interest in customer service or solving problems for the customer.  When I call Amazon I'm going to make sure to tell them that Intelcom is damaging Amazon's reputation for customer service.  If there was a zero rating, that's what I'd give them.Date of experience: July 21, 2024LLLi Lin9 reviewsCADec 7, 2022Worst service ever.They never come pick up your item. I had to reschedule four times because they never showed up and I was home the entire time. They'll send an automated message in the morning via text to be ready to hand the item to the driver but no information on who is picking the item up and how they will reach out to you. They even reschedule for you last minute without warning and still don't even show up. Waste of my time.Date of experience: December 06, 2022EDEdward5 reviewsCAFeb 10, 2024I'm Waiting!!!I am waiting for my package. Apparently it is in Surrey, and except for 2 snow days, it has not made it to my home. They say on their \"Missed Delivery\" slip they will make 4 attempts to deliver. Well what happened to numbers 2,3,and 4? Tried to phone, got through and was told someone would phone the next day. Obviously with 365 days in a year, next day could mean anyone of those days. This must be an extremely small company (1 delivery bicycle) and a 2 hour work day, along with a hour long lunch break. Please for heaven's sake, just deliver my package. If you tell me where, I'll come and pick it up, OK?Date of experience: February 05, 2024BHBH2 reviewsCADec 14, 2022Intelcom are liars, Amazon unaccountableAfter weeks of differing excuses about how they had tried to deliver and then couldn't deliver, Intelcom's HQ in headquarters in Quebec said they had never received our packages to deliver in the first place. So far worse than simple incompetence: lying to the customer's face repeatedly, followed by a refund from Amazon for the four missing items, bought over several weeks, but not delivered. Amazon should be refunding me for the hours spent on the phone with Intelcom, the aggravation caused, and the search to find the goods elsewhere. There's no accountability from Amazon: Intelcom are their chosen courier. Well, neither will ever receive my business again.Date of experience: December 12, 2022Previous156711Next pageIs this your company?Claim your profile to access Trustpilot’s free business tools and connect with customers.Get free accountCompany activitySee allUnclaimed profileNo history of asking for reviewsPeople review on their own initiativeIs this your company?Claim your profile to access Trustpilot’s free business tools and connect with customers.Get free accountPeople who looked at this company also looked atIntelcomexpress1,267Unclaimeddragonflyshipping.com.au95UnclaimedFedEx40,120ClaimedSuggested companies are based on people’s browsing tendencies.The Trustpilot ExperienceWe're open to allAnyone can write a Trustpilot review.

However this delivery service left it in the main hall unattended where everyone has access to it, also people from outside.. luckily I was still in time to collect it before someone else took it, but this is unacceptable. It takes me quite some time to come down as it is a big building and it wouldn’t be the first time losing a package because of poor service. If you don’t feel like doing your job then please leave it to delivery service who want to do it.

I was supposed to receive a package, and I was at home the entire day on the delivery date when I suddenly got an email saying it had been delivered.I never heard my doorbell ring, and the timestamp from my Ring camera showed no one walking in front of the house. Now, I have received an email from their customer service stating that the courier said it was definitely delivered to our house. However, it was delivered to my neighbor, who also has a Ring camera to prove the delivery.I hope their service improves, but I did not appreciate the feedback from customer service claiming it was definitely delivered to me. I don’t mind getting my package from the neighbors, but at least leave a note indicating where it was delivered instead of making me search for which neighbor received it. I stayed at home to receive the package and to avoid burdening other people.Date of experience: July 08, 2024Reply from PackalyJul 11, 2024Hi Shaira,Thank you for sharing your experience with us. I sincerely apologise for the frustration and inconvenience you’ve encountered with our delivery service. It's concerning to hear that despite being home all day, your package was not delivered directly to you, and the communication from our customer service added to the confusion.Your feedback is invaluable, and we will use it to improve our service. Ensuring accurate delivery and proper communication is a priority for us. In the future, our couriers will be reminded to leave a note indicating where the package has been delivered if it’s not handed directly to the recipient. This way, you won’t have to go through the trouble of locating your package.Once again, we apologise for the inconvenience and appreciate your understanding. If there is anything else we can do to assist you or if you have further concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact our support team.A. J.7 reviewsNLUpdated Aug 13, 2024Public Lobby Delivery? Packaly’s New 'Hide-and-Seek' Service!Update: 250746898215. Zara’s still on the case and not yet believing me it is really lost, but Packaly’s already closed it, admitting on email they sent my package into the void. I’m over here like, ‘Can someone just solve this so I can move on?Alright, so picture this: I’m expecting a package from Zara, right? It’s supposed to be delivered to my home. Now, I’m out for the day, probably getting some air after all that online shopping. I get back and… nothing. Nada. No package.So I hit up Packaly, and these folks straight-up confess like it’s normal, “Oh, we left it in the lobby.” The public lobby. You know, that place where everybody and their mama can just walk in, take a seat, maybe even leave with a free package if they’re feeling lucky.Now, I don’t know who’s training these delivery guys, but it’s like they’re playing a game of \"Who Wants to Lose a Package?\" and I’m the one on the losing end.This is some next-level service. It’s like Packaly got inspired by Houdini—except instead of making things appear, they make them disappear! If you ever wanted your package to perform a magic trick and vanish into thin air, just call Packaly. They’ll hook you right up.Date of experience: August 08, 2024Reply from PackalyAug 12, 2024Hi, Thank you for your feedback.

We are stuck with this company and not a single person helps. We stopped receiving codes last week. Our office said it's on parcel pending. After spending 3+ hours on hold last week, someone told me they \"updated lockers and ours was not updated but no need to worry! It's fixed.\" WRONG. Today, 4 packages get delivered and we don't get codes. My office can't find the packages, and I have currently been on hold with parcel pending for 2 HOURS. The callback option does NOT WORK and they don't call back. This company is an absolute scam and if anyone reading this that works at the company wants to actually do their job and contact me to get my stolen packages from your company delivered, that'd be fantastic but we all know they could care less.Date of experience: August 07, 2023Reply from Parcel Pending by QuadientUpdated Aug 8, 2023Hello Ashley, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us.

They promised to do better going forward & I think the whole debacle was a series of unfortunate events. I don’t think this is the norm. I upgraded my review to 3 stars as I wait to see how long it stays repaired. Again, the nicest people at this company. A very nice service while it works. When it breaks there is zero accountability & zero help. I’ve just been on the phone for the 3rd time with a very nice lady who gave me great excuses but no resolution or even a plan to resolve. You have been warned. There are other locker companies out there. Try them first.*** UPDATE*** We finally got a tech out but they were unable to fix it despite bringing equipment to replace the brain & modem. They are seemingly without any quality techs.

Thank you, Brad Bishop AdvertisementUCUnhappy Customer1 reviewUSUpdated Oct 18, 2023Frustrating Experience with Parcel PendingThe most infuriating aspect of Parcel Pending was the blatant misrepresentation of their product and services. They promised a convenient and reliable parcel management system, but what our property received was the complete opposite. The lockers often malfunction, and the app is clunky and difficult to use. It feels like they were selling a dream but delivering a nightmare.My experience with Parcel Pending was nothing short of a disaster. Their customer service is apathetic, bordering on incompetence, their organization is chaotic, and their product and services are misrepresented. I strongly advise anyone considering using their services to think twice and explore alternative options. It's safe to say I won't recommend  Parcel Pending and I'd strongly recommend others to avoid them at all costs.  I made a terrible mistake by falling for their sales pitch. Be warned and don't make the same mistake I did. Edited to add: Parcel Pending contacted me to say reach out to customer service.  They don’t have customer service, they have customer  non-service.  Pathetic.Date of experience: October 01, 2023Reply from Parcel Pending by QuadientOct 18, 2023Thank you for reaching out - we appreciate you sharing the feedback.

Up to a point everything was fine, but then I wasn't receiving notifications and the leasing office said the whole system was down so we had to retrieve deliveries from the leasing office. While we were all obviously still paying a monthly fee for the service. And now, even though I finally get notification again, the kiosk b is always down. Last time I called to check on why I wasn't getting notifications, they said kiosk be was down and that was a month ago. I had two packages delivered today. One to kiosk a which I was able to open. The other was put in kiosk b, I couldn't retrieve it even after I called. She tried to open it from there and it wouldn't open. Then they say they'll contact the people on site, which obviously they haven't done since for several months half of the lockers don't work. So then they tell me I need to go to the leasing office. I'm paying for a service that works 50% of the time and then when it doesn't work I have to put extra time into being able to retrieve my mail? I feel bad for people who need something like medication but can't access it for several days. It's not like I can go to the leasing office on the weekend or if there's a long holiday weekend. It just makes me angry that we're paying for a service that never works. I wish the complex would go with a different company. I will say that when I actually talk to somebody on the phone from their staff they're very nice and they try their best. Through email though it's not been very helpful. But I feel like every time I get a package I need to call this company about something because their system doesn't workDate of experience: January 15, 2023Laura Lehnherr1 reviewUSSep 20, 2023I was on hold for over 10 minutes when…I was on hold for over 10 minutes when Cheryl answered......she listened, put me at eased and we laughed a lot.

It literally took less time for my package to get to the Netherlands than it took for this company to bring it to my home. I hope everyone is aware that the distance between China and Schipol is much more than the distance between Schipol and Amstelveen. Even if you threw it in the air it could have found its way to my home with the wind. Even postnl would have delivered it faster. Like what the hell. On their website, it says \"Green, same-day delivery made effortless\". I can easily see the effortless part and you can only hope for the delivery part because they are not doing any effort for it.

Despite the fact that I paid for delivery, the provider is now asking me to take the item in person. What kind of customer service is this?

I was waiting for a very important package, according to the tracking I should have been delivered a certain day, so to be sure I was home, I contacted customer support asking if they are sure it would be delivered that day, they confirmed and I took a day off to be home. The day comes and the tracking updates with “attempt delivery failed” I contacted the customer service and they told me that the driver could not find the address. So I asked again when it would be delivered, and they said the day after and they assured me that it would be delivered that day. So I take another day off and guess what? I received an email from customer support saying that they would delivery it that day after again. So I asked if I could just pick it up myself given the fact that they aren’t able to deliver.l but they stopped replying.Date of experience: November 03, 2023VIVincent91 reviewsNLUpdated Aug 28, 2024Another terrible delivery company.Another terrible delivery company.It appears delivery companies in general are so bad that even companies such as Peddler.com are still in business.When ordering something delivered via Peddler.com, you will not receive a single email for confirmation or tracking for weeks, but you will receive just one email about one hour before the delivery itself, making it impossible to plan in advnce (I see that email only after I am at work, so it is too late to go home to get the packageThen. they systematically leave the package in the entrance (2 packages stolen som far in the last 3 months), no matter how many times tou contact them to ask them to stop doing this and to deliver like any other com pany only at the delivery address (at my door, not in the street). That useless email contains also :\"Do you have an urgent question, or want to get in touch for another reason? Then send a message to helpdesk[at]peddler.com\"And of course if you send anything there, they will urgently reply a week later saying they do not understand what delivery it is about.This company will not stay long in business and this is for the best. Any tim I have an option to select a different transporter, I do.Update - they just replied to my email to explain the package was left to a neighbor. Nothing in the email that confirm' the delivery says anything about it.So apparently it's for the customer to ring every single door in the apartment complex to find the package himself. I mean they have the information, and they are not even able to provide it in their email confirming the delivery???  Now I understand why I lost about 200 euros of packages over the last few months. Some package may still be in one of the 80 apartments in the building. RIDICULOUS.[update] I just came back home, checked the neighbour address as advised by their support, and of course, no package to be found at this address. Another lost one. They do not have a clue.

I stock with peddler and they sent a message off the the third party merchant to whom was actually supplying the xbox and arranging the delivery. They said they ran out of stock and will issue a refund.They issued the refund, peddler sent a email to confirm the refund was made however, over 5 days later no refund was made.In addition to this, the telephone number you are given will get you through the first time then after that I think they block your number. You’ll call, be listening to their hold music for around 3 minutes then a male voice will say “hello” followed promptly by the line hanging up.Absolutely terrible customer service, seems like a scam organisation to me. I feel as thou I have been robbed for £318.00. And I will be reporting this to the authorities here in the UK about both peddler.com and their third party merchant PSK Megastore.Date of experience: October 09, 2019Reply from Peddler.comOct 9, 2019Hello London-Buyer, we are sorry to see your review.

(I was at home never heard a bell) Then I contacted support to tell them to either redeliver today or that i come pick it up being that the eta on the app said that it would be here later. The guy did not help me at all and said it would be redeliverd in 2 bussiness days even though it was not my fault for not being able to open the door. After that message i asked them again if it could be redeliverd or that i can come pick it up somewhere to which they dont even respond anymore, even though i said it was an urgent package. I was helped by Rafael.Tracking: NLEXP0002591022INTPEDEdit: two more days have past and i have been calling them like 10 times. Everytime they check my tracking number and tell me that it’s with the delivery guy but they never come by. When i tell them that i can pick up the package myself since they clearly do not have the capacity to deliver packages that should be delivered 3 days ago. They keep telling me i can’t come by and keep giving me false hope by saying that the package is with the delivery guy just to not deliver. Yesterday they said it will be deliverd between 3-8pm but after waiting all day and not going out of the house i called again and they said that the delivery person has a flat tire. Then they told me when i would like it to be delivered on the next day (today) and i said before the afternoon and made my mom wait home all day. Still nothing has been delivered. If you have any value for your time NEVER USE this scam company.Date of experience: April 30, 2024Reply from Peddler.comMay 14, 2024Dear Bobby,I am sorry to hear that your experience with Peddler did not meet your expectations.

Firstly, the delivery date was wrongly advertised and the moment I ordered, i was provided the date that didnt work for me. I kept following up with the merchant and with peddler to change the delivery date, but no one bothered responding and then I cancelled the order. I got two responses from the merchant and Peddler, confirming the order was cancelled and refund will be issued. And while I was away, the phone was delivered to the neighbour and of course the refund wasnt issued. Now second set of follow ups started, to which again merchant didnt respond and even after numerous email exchanges with Peddler, the phone hasnt been collected and money not refunded. It seems, Peddler has no control over its merchants, and the overall experience has been terrible. I should have stuck with Amazon with 5% higher price, its certainly not worth the headache. Buy from Peddler at your own peril.Update after 3 days:Peddler got in touch, apologising and promising to send a return label after this review. And that was 3 days ago. And no return label in sight. I am still having to follow up for release of the money from Peddler and merchant. All online transactions are protected by the bank, trying to raise this as a fraudulent transaction since the item was forced upon me despite cancellation.Date of experience: November 14, 2019Reply from Peddler.comNov 14, 2019Hello Anish, we are sorry to see your feedback.We have spoken to our team who have confirmed that they are awaiting the collection details from the merchant. Once the phone has been collected a full refund can be issued. Our sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused. Our team will be in touch again shortly.

I have contacted Bongos Bingo recommending they no longer work with you, as they cannot do anything to resolve. My friend and I are due nearly £1200 - £600 each, and we have still heard nothing.

My claim has been ‘escalated’ about 15 times, only to keep receiving the same copy and pasted response. Despite all this, Pollen feel offering £200 discount on future bookings is some kind of compensation! There are literally thousands of people whose money they are holding on to!

They have gone into administration and are saying they will not be offering any customer refunds, whilst their statement of affairs on companies house states that their shareholders will be paid out £157million!!! They use the trading name STREET TEAM SOFTWARE LTD. This is absolutely disgusting when thousands of customers are still owed refunds. This robbing fraudulent company have taken advantage of thousands of young people and stolen money in the most unethical way. The selfish owners need to take accountability and do the right thing and pay out their customers. Contact the owners and the administrators however you can - LinkedIn, Twitter - the owners are Callum & Liam Negus-Fancey and James Ellis.

They claimed they’d refund us within 90 days…it’s been 8 MONTHS and NONE of us in my group have received a refund. We tried getting our money back through our banks and couldn’t because Pollen won’t respond to the bank’s inquiry. I will NEVER book with pollen again. A COMPLETE SCAM!

Bought tickets for We Are Mexico and due to coronavirus did not make it. Still waiting for the refund, every other member of my group have received their refund and I am still waiting and have been waiting for the past few months! This refund was supposed to pay for another holiday which I have had to pay out of my own money and this has now left me in a bad financial situation. I have emailed and contacted pollen many times and I either not got a reply or just got told to make a complaint. This is not acceptable, the refund period is 90days. The email was sent on the 15th of February, putting the refund date in May. It is not the middle of august and still have had no communication. Any communication had to this date was unprofessional, rude, inappropriate and unethical especially during this time where peoples finances are not great.

DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY!!! THEY ARE SCAMMERS! #1 We paid for 3 VIP passes for the J Balvin Cancun weekend; we contacted support to confirm we did buy 3 VIP passes. They said yes!!! Then surprise - we only got delivered 1 VIP pass, and 2 GA passes. They refused to take any responsibility for changing the price and saying we only paid for one!!! We have screenshots of emails proving they told us the 3 VIP pass was x amount of money, and then they said that's actually just for 1 VIP pass AND refused to help us upgrade the two GA passes! It was IMPOSSIBLE to get any help because they literally kept moving us to different people to talk to over email to the point that nothing was ever resolved. THEY ARE THE LITERAL WORST.#2 We requested a refund and followed all their requirements (each group member had to file a form within a week of the event postponement). The 90-day period passed with no refund—they followed up with an email saying we'd get our refund by July 30th, AND STILL NOTHING.

They did not do this and still have the money I paid for the festival that was cancelled on MARCH 16th, three and a half months ago. They also have two of my friend's money too, from the same event. This company are holding onto people's money for no good reason and you should avoid any event which they are involved in. They are scam artists. They now have around 45% 1 star reviews here.

The size and location of this festival was amazing, it was such a great vibe, but was never overwhelming or felt unsafe. There were loads of food options and queues were generally super reasonable for everything. I think I'm not the only one to say this, but the only real negative for me was drinks prices (including soft drinks and water, which is pretty essential if you're putting on a festival in a hot country). Alcohol was wildly unaffordable, I think it was like €9 for a strongbow, but water being so expensive was quite irresponsible, as you were only allowed to bring in 1x 50cl bottle, which for an entire day is probably not enough. I think this kind of thing can sometimes encourage people to overdo it before coming in to the festival, which isn't great either! The line up was awesome and pollen provided s lot of guidance on where to stay, etc, so overall this was stress free and really well organised. I liked the wrist band payment thing, too!Date of experience: July 29, 2022EEEzra Estrada1 reviewUSJan 4, 2023VerifiedI booked two Tony Hawk packages and the…I booked two Tony Hawk packages and the event was cancelled in Vegas.

Even though the address on the package was correct they called and needed a lot of help finding the building (a UPS Store with a clearly labeled storefront) including saying it wasn't there until they found it. I was lucky I picked up the call at all.

I live in a large city, in a high foot traffic area and they have left my parcels out on the sidewalk, near the door of a building. They take a picture as proof of delivery, of course, but the picture is simply of a package left out in public. If theft is common in your area, as it is in mine, I would watch UniUni tracking very carefully.Date of experience: June 08, 2024MIKA PUNZALAN1 reviewCAJun 19, 2024I think this is ScamI think this is Scam. I ordered in Shein and it says that delivery attempt is failed because my address is incorrect. I paid it. I dont know why Shein partnership with this delivery company. Im trying contacting them but I guess my package will just be lost. Thanks for scamming peopleDate of experience: June 19, 2024Jerry Mitgang2 reviewsUSMay 29, 2024Incompetent! wrong address!So I ordered a couple of things from one supplier on aliexpress and I know I entered all of my information correctly. I was wondering why it was taking so long to receive it and it was 5 days passed the actual delivery date. I log in and check my orders on ALI and it said failed delivery attempt. I check the delivery address and UNIUNI got it alllllll Effing wrong! They put my phone number instead of my address! How dumb! I'd like to reorder these parts because I really need them for work but I don't want it sent and delivered with this incompetent company. Date of experience: May 28, 2024Carl Arrington1 reviewUSJul 13, 2024Zero stars would still be too manyZero stars would still be too many. Honestly, I don’t know how this company can improve their practices, that’s how ridiculous this farce of a company manages themselves. This review isn’t meant to be constructive, it’s meant to warn people about this company. I had a parcel out for delivery July 9, the driver failed to deliver the parcel stating that they tried but failed. The driver lied about “attempting” anything. I then contacted the company about getting my package a second attempt to be delivered and was told it would be delivered within 24-48 hours. After multiple attempts to contact them, 70 hours later I receive another email stating that my package should be delivered within another 7 business days. This company lies about their practices, the drivers lie about their behaviors, and everyone should be warned and find another option.

Otherwise, just pray your retailer doesn't use them.Date of experience: May 26, 2024Amanda Monteforte1 reviewUSJun 11, 2024TerribleI got a notification on Friday, May 24 that there was an attempted delivery that failed and that they'd reattempt the following day. Heard nothing and submitted a ticket the following Wednesday which the site says would be responded to within 3 days. Heard nothing so called and was on hold for 3 hours, and ended up hanging up as the call was never picked up. Submitted a ticket to the company I ordered from and they followed up. The package was delivered a week and a half later. My ticket was responded to that I had submitted more than 2 weeks later.

Who in it's right mind leaves a package outside of a building where EVERYONE on the street can see the package and take it. Why can't the delivery guy go inside and drop the package in front of the client's door?? Or call the client as you say?? This is not the first time your delivery guys do that. What type of management are you guys doing??Date of experience: May 19, 2024Jeff Sawatzke10 reviewsUSAug 28, 2024Would give them zero stars if it were…Would give them zero stars if it were an option.They sent \"proof of delivery\"  it was guy holding the package in his car.

I live in a house and there is no mailroom.Date of experience: May 17, 2024Carolyn Lovett1 reviewUSMay 17, 2024LOUSY GARMENTLOUSY GARMENTI received my order on the promised date.  However, the garment had 1001 wrinkles, the buttons were on the wrong belt lines, and it was the wrong size.   I needed it the THE VERY NEXT DAY, but it was unwearable because the wrinkles were PRESSED-IN -- NO BURNT-IN on polyester material and could not be pressed out.There were no tags on the garment, leaving no proof of purchase.  I'll never purchase anything from this company again -- or any company who uses this company.  I hope Amazon will refuse to allow any attachments with this company.Date of experience: May 03, 2024Chellemay West1 reviewUSJul 23, 2024This company is horrible I ordered…This company is horrible I ordered around $60.00 worth the product and haven’t received anything claiming they had the wrong address and when trying to get a refund the contact number no longer in service i believe this company is really a scammer Date of experience: July 17, 2024Monica2 reviewsCASep 9, 2024No Reasonable Attempt Made to Locate the Address – Seen on My Video Doorbell I never had a problem with delivery from UniUni when ordering from Temu.Recently that has changed, as the couriers are no longer delivery packages to the townhouse number show above the front doors, but putting another households package on my deck which clearly does NOT have a unit number posted above the door.If these so called delivery people took the time to look around & actually try and deliver it, they would be doing their job.I resent their website FAQ stating:Check with Others: Verify with neighbors, building management, or the mailroom/lobby to see if the package was misplaced.Good excuse for LAZY delivery staff !!As seen on my Doorbell Video: The courier (male) is clearly seen getting out of his vehicle, walking across the grass, to my patio and to my side door. The parking lot is 60+ feet from my side door. He never even looked at the other townhouses, headed straight for my deck, takes his picture careful not to show the side door WITHOUT a house number and leaves.It has happened twice in 5-6 weeks.This is very frustrating to see package(s) not delivered to the rightful owner. There is no excuse when I see other delivery people looking up at the doors of the units, doing what they are hired to do...deliver to the customer !Date of experience: September 08, 2024ARArkell 4 reviewsUSJun 13, 2024Horrible companyLike so many people here, my package was delivered to the wrong address. Never received it. I filed a complaint with UniUni and never heard from them except for them to say they received the complaint. I will no longer order from Aliexpress because they use this company to deliver. The 1 star reviews speak for themselves. UniUni is a terrible company.Date of experience: May 25, 2024Clara1 reviewCAJul 22, 2024They are the worstThey are the worst, you would never get your package. I mean never. Your package has been delivered one minute the next you’re outside and your package is nowhere to be seen. You stay on the line for 2 hours waiting to talk to a real human and when you do, you get the same trash of there is nothing they can do while their drivers clearly stole the package. I wonder why some companies still work with them. Like you are legit looking at a picture with your package outside your door but you can’t find your package. Date of experience: July 13, 2024TATahnia1 reviewCAJul 25, 20240 stars0 stars! Absolutely horrible service! My delivery says multiple failed delivery attempts when i was tracking the parcel the whole day and received only one phone call. i always give the same address and NOBODY, I mean nobody ever has trouble delivering my parcel! i called the number that called me right away and the person on the other line said he called by mistake, i asked if he does delivery and he took my name and address then he said 'no, i dont have any' i asked if he does delivery and can check my tracking number and he goes on to say that 'HE DOES NOT' - that was the only call and then i see that the parcel is being returned to the warehouse and they are claiming multiple failed attempts  - i hve called them 3 times now. i am flying out and need the parcel immediately but their drivers and customer service is rude and slow. Worst business and horrible management!Date of experience: July 24, 2024Laurian Ince2 reviewsJMMay 18, 2024Dishonest, fraud, thief Do not use uniuni as your shipping company of choice.  They are a scam. They delivered my package to the wrong address, delivered after hours, left package outside and package was stolen. They have admitted that the driver delivered the package to an unsecured location and package is deemed lost but yet they don’t now want to reimburse for their negligence. They are sending me to the seller to request a refund when they have picture evidence of having the package in their presence. They are also encouraging me to claim from my bank. They are dishonest and a fraud.Date of experience: May 17, 2024MDMark Desmarais14 reviewsCAMay 16, 2024Not sure who the sender is..makes me uncomfortable …They attempted delivery @ 4:51 PM Wednesday May 15th. Looks like package was returned to warehouse today @ 7:31 AM. BUT..I refuse to click on customer service link because: It said unit no. was missing..too bad..as it's clearly stated on the e-mail they sent me?? Were they looking for phone no? Since it does not state who the SENDER is..I am unwilling to fill out a customer service query/ ticket as there is \" too much\" fraud going on at the moment. Sorry I did not order from Sportchek who uses Purolator and if you're not home pkg. goes to Platon Variety...two addresses beside me. What a shame!Date of experience: May 15, 2024Lavie1 reviewUSJun 7, 2024Trash , Trash, and Trash !I’ve been ordering from SHEIN for a while now… and all of my packages have been delivered by FEDEX or USPS and they have all gotten to my house before the delivery date or in the middle of it. This “uniuni” sent my package back to some random warehouse, and my address was completely correct and it said the address was invalid .. The same address I’ve been using that’s literally saved in my phone is invalid , what? I couldn’t even get in touch with them because none of their stuff even works, it’s so bogus. I’ve sent two customer tickets and they haven’t responded to either !! This is so disappointing, just do you’re job and everyone will be happy !Date of experience: May 31, 2024Joanie Straw1 reviewCAAug 3, 2024While I've been on hold for 10 minutes for over an hour...While I've been on hold for almost an hour because of \"high call volume\", I checked in with the chatbot. We know that with AI now, it's a way for the company to not deal with issues effectively and save $$ on proper staffing. Especially if the site attempts to direct you to the phone numbers, and the phone messaging then directs you to a \"waste of time\" loop back to the website. They do not hire enough staff to field the horrible service provided...just look at the reviews here - nearly all 1 star. PLEASE contact the company you ordered items from and make them aware THAT YOU WILL NO LONGER ORDER FROM THEM if UNI UNI is delivering. A few orders won't make a difference, but if a high volume of ex-customers reach them it may mean better service in the future. Also, there is no contact information in the \"About\" section, despite the company's claim to have expanded to many cities. If this is a genuine claim, they're doing well enough to hire qualified people and provide jobs rather than insult customers.

Recently, they said that they attempted to deliver to my address. I was home at the time and have an active doorbell cam. No one came to my door a the time they indicated. Then they changed their story and said that the shipment was refused. Brutal...

I have had them deliver packages to neighbours, leave them on the steps of a multi unit apartment complex and damage packages during shipment.

I was wondering why it was taking so long to receive it and it was 5 days passed the actual delivery date. I log in and check my orders on ALI and it said failed delivery attempt. I check the delivery address and UNIUNI got it alllllll Effing wrong! They put my phone number instead of my address! How dumb! I'd like to reorder these parts because I really need them for work but I don't want it sent and delivered with this incompetent company. Date of experience: May 28, 2024Carl Arrington1 reviewUSJul 13, 2024Zero stars would still be too manyZero stars would still be too many. Honestly, I don’t know how this company can improve their practices, that’s how ridiculous this farce of a company manages themselves. This review isn’t meant to be constructive, it’s meant to warn people about this company. I had a parcel out for delivery July 9, the driver failed to deliver the parcel stating that they tried but failed. The driver lied about “attempting” anything. I then contacted the company about getting my package a second attempt to be delivered and was told it would be delivered within 24-48 hours. After multiple attempts to contact them, 70 hours later I receive another email stating that my package should be delivered within another 7 business days. This company lies about their practices, the drivers lie about their behaviors, and everyone should be warned and find another option.

Heard nothing and submitted a ticket the following Wednesday which the site says would be responded to within 3 days. Heard nothing so called and was on hold for 3 hours, and ended up hanging up as the call was never picked up. Submitted a ticket to the company I ordered from and they followed up. The package was delivered a week and a half later. My ticket was responded to that I had submitted more than 2 weeks later.

The parking lot is 60+ feet from my side door. He never even looked at the other townhouses, headed straight for my deck, takes his picture careful not to show the side door WITHOUT a house number and leaves.It has happened twice in 5-6 weeks.This is very frustrating to see package(s) not delivered to the rightful owner. There is no excuse when I see other delivery people looking up at the doors of the units, doing what they are hired to do...deliver to the customer !Date of experience: September 08, 2024ARArkell 4 reviewsUSJun 13, 2024Horrible companyLike so many people here, my package was delivered to the wrong address.

You stay on the line for 2 hours waiting to talk to a real human and when you do, you get the same trash of there is nothing they can do while their drivers clearly stole the package.

They are a scam. They delivered my package to the wrong address, delivered after hours, left package outside and package was stolen. They have admitted that the driver delivered the package to an unsecured location and package is deemed lost but yet they don’t now want to reimburse for their negligence. They are sending me to the seller to request a refund when they have picture evidence of having the package in their presence. They are also encouraging me to claim from my bank.

BUT..I refuse to click on customer service link because: It said unit no. was missing..too bad..as it's clearly stated on the e-mail they sent me?? Were they looking for phone no? Since it does not state who the SENDER is..I am unwilling to fill out a customer service query/ ticket as there is \" too much\" fraud going on at the moment.

The same address I’ve been using that’s literally saved in my phone is invalid , what? I couldn’t even get in touch with them because none of their stuff even works, it’s so bogus.

We know that with AI now, it's a way for the company to not deal with issues effectively and save $$ on proper staffing. Especially if the site attempts to direct you to the phone numbers, and the phone messaging then directs you to a \"waste of time\" loop back to the website. They do not hire enough staff to field the horrible service provided...just look at the reviews here - nearly all 1 star. PLEASE contact the company you ordered items from and make them aware THAT YOU WILL NO LONGER ORDER FROM THEM if UNI UNI is delivering. A few orders won't make a difference, but if a high volume of ex-customers reach them it may mean better service in the future. Also, there is no contact information in the \"About\" section, despite the company's claim to have expanded to many cities. If this is a genuine claim, they're doing well enough to hire qualified people and provide jobs rather than insult customers.

I tried to email Shopify with evidence and explanations of what I was going through. However, they couldn’t open a ticket unless I go through the help centre on the website which was an ai chat. When explaining to the ai chat, it took me to a link where I can report an issue with an order form but I needed a url confirmation link in irser to report. Yes it explained how to find this, but the company I ordered from did not provide. I had to complain somewhere else which hopefully they will be able to get back to me. Overall, I just feel like it will be easier if Shopify allows emails as this will be easier for us customers to express and explain without having to set up an account and using ai chats. Date of experience: September 27, 2024AdvertisementTheFeinheit2 reviewsAEOct 29, 2024Terminated without Notice and didn't give the PayoutIf I can give zero, I would. The worst possible scenario to happen with any business owners is to get terminated without any notice. Locked out of your store, no possible way to get your customer details, no refund for all yearly subscription, not paid your payout even contacting them for almost a month - and in the end, they cannot disclose why they have terminated you! Good thing the last product I sold was shipped by my supplier to the customer - but the money the customers paid... nadah! I didn't get it. With all the money I wasted with the shop, setting it up, now even the payout!!! You should be shut down. This is not how you do business. You should discuss the violation the business owner did and give them time to justify - you don't just shut down a business then replied after 10 days that you cannot disclose why they were shutdown!! SMEs are not earning as much money as big companies. You should think of the investment they did to make it work - and you should pay the money that belongs to them! The money the customer pays are for the business owners, not yours! We paid the suppliers already, the customers receive their products - you should give our money back! This is really not how you do business! For everyone, think first before you build your empire; otherwise, in one click, they can just crush it and there is nothing you can do, because you will be stuck with a customer service who will tell you \"we have no access why you were shut down, but let me escalate it\" and that's it.... weeks after, you are still waiting for that response they promise they would.

During this time, Shopify’s support was nothing short of frustrating and completely incompetent.I spent over 3 hours on a call with their support team, who kept suggesting the same ineffective solutions over and over again, only to then tell me to wait 48 hours after each attempt—nothing worked! Despite the urgency, they didn’t offer any real help or alternative solutions. My business suffered while they wasted time and didn’t take the problem seriously.To make matters worse, it was entirely their fault, and they could have resolved this issue much earlier, but instead, they prolonged the downtime unnecessarily. Talking to their support feels like communicating with a robot—zero accountability and no care for how their failures impacted my business.I’ve never had a more stressful experience with a service provider. If you're considering Shopify, be warned—they are completely unreliable when it comes to support, and you’ll be left on your own when problems arise.Date of experience: October 06, 2024Jake Mulligan7 reviewsUSOct 9, 2024They do try to take unnecessary money…They do try to take unnecessary money from you.

Their policies set you up to fail. They want their hand in the pot and don't want to eat, too.

My shop does not have a phone number and I do not want my personal phone number to be made public.After > 1 hour of communicating with support, it was suggested to me to enter a FAKE PHONE NUMBER!I explained it is a very BAD idea to give fraudulent information to my customers. I also informed support that I resolved my issue (while awaiting their answer) by using a FB shopify chat group (obtained a free Google Voice number which transferred to my private phone).Advising to pass fraudulent information to my customers is not anything I want to be associated with.I am waiting propagation completion of my DNS records back to bluehost.I am outta here shopify!Choose CAREFULLY my friends...Date of experience: September 18, 2024laurie3 reviewsUSAug 19, 2024Shopify offers $1Shopify offers $1. start up, however in order to see the plans, a credit card is needed.

Support has gone downhill recently I'm a Shopify partner and expert. I've build many stores on Shopify and have built and manage an app on the Shopify app store. I like lots of things about Shopify - it's easy to get started, and it has so many great tools to help merchants and users scale their businesses. I still recommend it to all of my clients.Unfortunately the support has gone downhill recently. I'm guessing they have moved their CSR employment overseas, and it shows. It's hard to get a hold of anyone, the AI bot is the worst, and when I do get in touch with someone they are not knowledgeable. Most of my questions are very straightforward, but it's such a huge pain to get in touch with anyone that I dread anytime I have to reach out to Shopify customer support.

As many merchants use Shopify to manage their backend, lots of orders that go through the Shopify platform has been causing me issues and serious delays. I have since reached out to Shopify to resolve this issue with no resolution. Essentially what Shop is doing is putting customers on a Chargeback Blacklists without evidence.

I was really looking forward to a warehousing provider with transparent pricing and a well-designed automated interface, but we never experienced any of these things. Perhaps it was just the sales person we were working with, but even getting a simple quote was like pulling teeth, and we had to follow up many times just to get responses.Date of experience: May 29, 2019Liz Thompson1 reviewUSSep 27, 2022Flowspace has been a lifesaver for us…Flowspace has been a lifesaver for us as a start-up in the food product area. Many things went wrong with the packing of our products from our co-packers and SEVERAL times I had to message Flowspace and our distribution warehouse, Columbia Distribution, and I always got the help I needed, especially when things were an emergency and had to be handed right away. Going forward, I know things will go smoother on our end, but knowing that extreme help is available is what it is all about for a staart-up, to have the needed support and also be walked through new things....I look forward to continuing with Flowspace and watching or products fly off onto trucks from the warehouse and selling our products successfully with such professional help.Date of experience: September 27, 2022Anastasia Visotsky1 reviewUSUpdated Jan 11, 2022Scammy chargesIncorrect inventory count leading to charging extra for ghost inventory, raising prices by 20-50% after half a year, overcharging on packing fees, incorrect shipping fees calculation (how about $80 instead of $8?), not following packing directions. No thank you. Enough is enough.UPD: Alright, it's been seven days as I'm trying to get my inventory to FBA (but first they need to enter a correct amount otherwise can't create outbound order) and the warehouse is not replying, customer service is not replying. I'm stuck with diminishing inventory on Amazon (and we all know what it means for the rankings) while Flowspace team is unresponsive.Date of experience: December 15, 2021Reply from FlowspaceDec 23, 2021Anastasia, I am regretful of your service experience.

As our business grows, it's becoming apparent how valuable their function is as it pertains to our business.  They have a very \"small business feel,\" which was one of the reasons we chose them as our 3PL solution - they make you feel taken care of, and respond swiftly to queries, and resolve problems with customized solutions. We've approached them with some unique challenges, and although that comes with innate friction, we have always arrived at a sufficient end-state.  They've even proven to think beyond the scope of their role - shout out to Casey - who has included us on other opportunities that could help our business grow in conjunction with Flowspace.Date of experience: April 02, 2019LDLee Daugherty1 reviewUSJan 25, 2022It's about choices and thank goodness I chose FlowspaceHere's the breakdown. Something is going to go wrong. You get that odd customer issue that's just not able to fit into a macro. So you reach out for help. That's where choices matter. We chose to go with Flowspace, they seemed established enough and large enough to be able to handle our shipping. When the holidays hit, all bets are off. Customers can go from zero to extra crazy very fast. I was relieved and happy that Flowspace really stepped up and gave me that personalized care and empathy during those crazy times. Thank you for making a stressful time more easy to handle so that I could really focus on the things that needed my attention!Date of experience: January 25, 2022Reply from FlowspaceJan 26, 2022Hello Lee, Thank you for your feedback!

I do not know what soured in the relationship between Flowspace and the warehouse (which changed ownership recently) but it resulted in the warehouse being very uncooperative.  First, they were overcharging for box assembly and packing.  And in the end, the warehouse stopped cooperating altogether, refusing to ship our product.  We are essentially unable to fulfill orders.  The Flowspace team has been very active in helping us find solutions to this problem.  The Flowspace team has been part of the solution, not the problem.  We appreciate their responsiveness.Date of experience: April 12, 2022Reply from FlowspaceApr 13, 2022John,Appreciate you sharing your service experience with the Flowspace team.

On Dec 5th - at the peak  of the holiday selling season they send a cold email saying they are increasing their prices by 350% at that start of January, so less than a month's notice -- NO JOKE, A SUDDEN INCREASE IN COST BY OVER 300%. They don't care at all, there is no-one to call when you need help & they don't want you to talk to the warehouse (the ones doing the actual work), so that is super shady. They do very little to help you & have put my small business is serious jeopardy as we try and scramble to find a new warehouse & fulfillment at the last minute, during the holiday season. When I asked to discuss it they just sent an email back a few days later with no attempt to help. Its a total joke & I wish I would have never signed up with Flowspace - the worst, most unprofessional abuse of customer relationships. They are just a weird middle man who overcharges you and ultimately screws you over. As I've told all my fellow small business owner friends - PLEASE STAY AWAY!Date of experience: December 11, 2019SUSusan1 reviewUSMar 7, 2019InvitedMonique has been a pleasure!Monique has been a pleasure!.

I placed an order with a seller, I’ll call AF. AF split the order in three. Two were mailed through UPS and one through LaserShip. LaserShip made two attempts to deliver their package and kept saying the address was incorrect and couldn’t find it. I triple checked address…it was correct. Tried to speak to someone to understand what the issue was and why they were seeming to have difficulty delivering to an address that all other carriers deliver to regularly. In fact, on the same day that LaserShip made their second attempt to deliver part of my order from AF, UPS successfully delivered their package from my AF order.  LaserShip was of no help when trying to get to the root of the problem. Even had a LaserShip representative named Alex the chat bot connected me with through chat message close out the chat before I was even able to push send on my message to them. Companies should never use this carrier. Stick with UPS, FedEx, USPS, DHL…just any other carrier than LaserShip (now OnTrac since the merge). Date of experience: May 20, 2024TOTomias/EMMA2 reviewsUSJun 29, 2023I only ordered soil but 5x tries still in limboI only ordered soil, 2 packs, the first one was delivered without a problem, with the other pack Lasership lied about attempting to deliver, it's been 5X attempts.Ridiculous, and when you call you cannot get anyone to talk about their lies .Date of experience: June 29, 2023Thomas Therkelsen9 reviewsDKAug 23, 2023Why does anyone use this?!Why major shoe companies use this company is beside me.I bought a pair of shoes off of adidas.com on the 19th of August. It gives me an estimated delivery date for 21st of August using lasership aka ontrac. In the afternoon I got a message that the parcel was out for delivery, and then at the exact same time a message that the delivery failed. A little suspect if you ask me.When I try to reach a customer service agent on their website all I get are bots that don't actually answer your messages, they just go through a standard copy paste procedure.We then called Adidas, who got through to the delivery driver who had put in the wrong address and was screaming at the adidas employee for it. I'll update this review further when more happens.Date of experience: August 21, 2023TPTP1 reviewUSMay 9, 2023Missing package from NordstromMy Nordstrom package was not delivered despite a photo being snapped of it outside of my garage.  I believe it was stolen by the driver.  This is the second time that I have had an issue receiving an order delivered by LaserShip.  I will avoid getting anything delivered by them in the future.Date of experience: May 04, 2023Ser Luk2 reviewsUSMar 6, 2023They are the worstThey are the worst. Sometimes my Amazon orders are delivered by lasership and they always, always mess, there was not even once they put my package on my porch - they just toss them wherever they can in a radius of 300 feet and I have to wander around looking for my package every time.  A few times packages were lost and every time I ask amazon's support not to ever deliver my packages with lasership.Date of experience: March 05, 2023Jennifer Lawler1 reviewUSNov 22, 2023Lasership is HORRIBLELasership is HORRIBLE.  The packages I have had \"delivered\" with them either come days late, don't get delivered at all, are delivered to the wrong address, or are \"attempted\" and then get sent back to the company I ordered from without my consent.  I am now on delivery reshipment #3 of an order I placed on 11/2...There is also no phone line to call, as every time you do call it says \"line busy\" and not being able to speak with an agent is 100% crap.  This company is a scam and made up of thief's who are stealing from customers and the company who you bought the product from.Date of experience: November 22, 2023RCRC6 reviewsUSJul 13, 2023ZERO starsI don't know why Crocs use a delivery company like this.Lasership received the package on Jun-29th and after 13 DAYS intead of they delivery it, they just sent a text message to me saying the package is returning to Crocs.In the tracking system for tracking code 1LSCXXH00949966, they added a note saying the delivery was refused or requested to be returned.How the delivery was refused if they never bring it to my front door?I'm at home all day long as I'm working from home and nobody showed up here with the package.Date of experience: July 12, 2023Ryan Cefalu2 reviewsUSAug 3, 2024Delivery was perfectDelivery was perfect.

This is the WORST package delivery service I have ever encountered in my adult life.  I cannot believe companies are still using this company for shipping!!!  I plan to report them to every governing authority possible.  They have repeatedly messed up my deliveries and this last one they didn't even bother to deliver and now I am left paying $94 for something I didn't even receive!!!!Date of experience: January 13, 2023Halsey Jackson1 reviewUSMar 20, 2023i have had nothing but terrible…i have had nothing but terrible experiences with this company and i’m not sure why retailers still choose to ship with them. every single time they have “delivered” an item to me it never shows up. their workers are dishonest and always say i signed for the item when that never happened.Date of experience: March 20, 2023JAJasmine3 reviewsUSJan 17, 2023Awful serviceI don’t even want to give them the one star. They provided no alert or notification that my package was on the way, so I was not expectant of it. They didn’t even provide me, the customer, a confirmation alert or email that they delivered the package. It also noted a signature was received. Which of course I didn’t provide, and which then leads me to believe they either forged a signature or allowed a random person to sign for it. Worst, as I read on other reviews, they stole it themselves. Needless to say, My package was stolen. I am in the process of asking my landlord for footage of what transpired during possible delivery times.Date of experience: January 16, 2023Julie Snead Erckenbrack1 reviewUSJun 3, 2023If I could give a zero I wouldIf I could give a zero I would. Every time this company delivers packages I never get it in first attempt. They never get into my gated neighborhood. They never call. I have provided gate code every time. I am amazed they r still in business. Impossible to get ahold of anyone. Fill out online forms and nothing happens. If I know a company is using them as delivery method I don’t order product.Date of experience: June 02, 2023myrtle1 reviewUSJul 22, 2023Very bad judgment in 3500 Durham NCI've tried to talk to management at 3500 in Durham NC at firing 16 to 18 people at one time, behind one driver, Taurus on the other hand has a personal issue with one driver Omar and decides to let everyone go. Because Omar mother owns the company. So he took it upon his self to let the rest of the team go. Now take note the company as a lot of illegals working for the company that are working under ghost numbers.  So what their doing is taking jobs from the American people and giving them to illegals because they can pay them less. My team has good numbers of delivery and tarus does this not behind business but personal issues.  I  love what I do and so does my fellow workers,  we just want our jobs back.Date of experience: July 19, 2023JFJFS1 reviewUSJul 25, 2023My package was delivered to the wrong…My package was delivered to the wrong address. No house number was shown on the confirmation picture so I had no way to find it. Lasership customer service told me it was delivered and there was no reason or my inquiry. They closed my ticket with no resolution. Horrible horrible company who should not be in business.Date of experience: July 05, 2023Edna Campos1 reviewUSDec 18, 2023This delivery company is a fraud!This company was supposed to deliver a package from Bath and Body Works but it was never delivered. The driver had the audacity to mark it as delivered when he/she never did. I have cameras in my home and never did anyone stop by. I was also on my stopp at the time they claimed my package was delivered and didn’t see anyone. I contacted customer care and told them that I suspected that the driver stole my package and they said that based on their investigation (which took like 1 min) they could not located my package and that I needed to contact the seller. Everyone in this company knows what is happening and all are playing a role in this fraud! I hope they face consequences for this!Date of experience: December 17, 2023Carnot Joseph2 reviewsUSDec 6, 2023I ordered from  Macy’sI ordered from  Macy’s, and Macy’s used their service to deliver my package. I have never received the package. The funny thing is that my family was outside at the time they said the package was delivered. However, they never came to deliver the package. I do not know why  Macy’s or other companies use them those crooks.Date of experience: December 04, 2023BRBri1 reviewUSAug 27, 2023NEGATIVE STARS!If I could give them negative stars I would. This is the WORST shipping company in the world. Every single package being delivered to me through Lasership has been stolen or lost. It is always marked as delivered when it hasn’t been delivered. Occasionally it shows up the next day but almost always it never shows up and I have to submit complaints with the retailers. I just had a package marked as delivered that was NOT delivered again today! BAN LASERSHIP!Date of experience: August 27, 2023KDKD3 reviewsUSJan 23, 2023The absolute WORST delivery service…The absolute WORST delivery service EVER.  Any time I have a package sent to me through them, it's ALWAYS a hassle.  I give instructions on how to get into my complex EVERY time and they STILL claim they don't have the information.  I've asked for a supervisor to contact me and none does.  They just keep \"assuring\" me that the package will be delivered the next business day.  Today is their 3rd alleged attempt to deliver a package - AFTER I gave them the information they claimed was missing and AFTER I also made sure they had my phone number - and they claimed they couldn't deliver AGAIN.  I honestly don't know how they stay in business.Date of experience: January 22, 2023FRfrustratedcustomer2 reviewsUSMay 10, 2023My package was intentionally left in a…My package was intentionally left in a wide open space instead of somewhat more closed and personal front porch of my apartment. I asked all the other tenants of my apartment about it with no response. After reading some other people's experiences, I started to think that it may be the work of the delivery guys. I contacted the LaserShip's customer service via email. They provided the case number, but absolutely no correspondence afterwards. I can't even give a star to this company but I have to in order to write my experience about them.Date of experience: May 06, 2023NHnereka harrell1 reviewUSJan 15, 2023Worse delivery company everWorse delivery company ever. I recieved notification that my package was delivered and a doorman signed. Well I live in a brand new housing community that does not have a doorman.  So who signed for my order. I was chatting with a bot that offered no assistance. After asking for a phone number it gave me a wrong phone number. This is not the first issue I had with lasership. I totally agree with the other customers.

I left delivery instructions with the purchasing site and with Lasership twice. On all those occasions the customer service rep neglected to pass on the delivery instructions to the delivery person on the truck. It’s been three weeks still waiting for my item that was supposed to arrive two weeks ago.Date of experience: February 04, 2023ISIrfan Suwandi3 reviewsUSFeb 19, 2023Stolen package0 Star if I could give this company. Order my shoes, it said delivered 3 days later. No package has been seen. Two people were in the house waiting for the package, but no signs coming, and no text or email notifications. No delivered package notification or whatever.It's a shame.Date of experience: February 14, 2023RERey1 reviewUSJul 9, 2023Placed an order on backcountryPlaced an order on backcountry, item was delivered to wrong house.They took a picture of the delivery and it was obviously wrong house, not even my neighbors house, the house address didn’t even match. I filed a complaint with Backcountry and fortunately they were able to resend the order via UPS next day air, which was delivered on time to the right house. I hope businesses stop using Lasership. They will lose money on every order. I filed a complaint with Lasership as well, and they sent a generic email saying they will contact me in 48 hours. It’s been a week and nothing. Lasership is the worst.Date of experience: June 29, 2023RORoma2 reviewsUSJan 4, 2023Total runaround is unbelievable!!!!!Total runaround is unbelievable!!!!!! Package shipped promptly from American Eagle. It arrived in my town 12/28…. And has been sitting there ever since!!!! Two inquiry letters have been sent on their tracking site and one 20+ minute phone call that was mysteriously “disconnected” while the representative was checking with the location as to the status of my delivery.  They never attempted to call me back though they DID have my phone number!  And WHY would I contact my seller when their own tracking documents that they indeed do have my package??? I did call LaserShip back again. Spoke to ANOTHER rep and still no idea where my package is?!? How do companies even trust this business to ship anything?? Nothing arrives to the paying customer but someone is certainly receiving the items WE pay for!!Date of experience: January 04, 2023Chrissy Brackel4 reviewsUSJun 13, 2023Packages never make it to their destinationAbsolutely AWFUL and untrustworthy company. I can't believe any companies are still using this delivery service. When my order ships and I see that it's with LaserShip, I know there's going to be trouble. On multiple occasions they have delivered my order to the wrong location, or the order has disappeared without a trace. On my most recent order from Abercrombie, the tracking said that the package was handed to me. It wasn't. On my last two orders that were \"delivered\" by LaserShip,\" the tracking came with a picture of someone else's porch. The drivers aren't even attempting to get it right - it's not that they had the wrong house number. It's literally not even the same street! I'm about to stop shopping with companies that use LaserShip because it's not worth the hassle.Date of experience: June 12, 2023NPNatalie Pratt3 reviewsUSApr 29, 2023The delivery driver did not attempt to…The delivery driver did not attempt to deliver my package at all. Someone is always home but it was indicated that an attempt was made that was a lie. Secondly the first 2 customer service reps that I spoke with were very rude. The second one hung up on me and talked over me the entire call. Luckily the next 2 calls that I placed to them I was fortunate enough to get 2 reps that were customer friendly and knowledgeable. Amazon should reconsider their contract with this courier. If any of my future Orders have to be delivered through them I’d pass and will rather not order.Date of experience: April 29, 2023SSStephen Shelden1 reviewUSJul 17, 2023Don’t use LaserShipI have multiple cameras covering the front yard and front door.

Amazon decided to use Lasership.They had my package since 11 a.m. & waited 6 p.m. to message me, claiming that the address they have for me is incomplete. I used their online form to send the correct one & got an autoresponse claiming that they'll try to get back to me within 2 bus days.Then I tried to call to speak with someone, but that is impossible (always the sign of a dodgy company) & wound up in a text exchange which may have been with a human or a robot who had my full address & said they'd deliver in a few bus days. Their tracking doesn't reflect them having the \"updated\" addressDate of experience: April 25, 2023Julia2 reviewsUSSep 15, 2023Dishonest and shady businessOn many occasions, LaserShip has provided me with inaccurate tracking information. Items do not arrive on the expected delivery date. For the last three times I have ordered something that is being shipped by Lasership, I get notifications that a delivery was attempted and failed or that the delivery was unable to be attempted due to issues with my address. LaserShip uses shady business practices. My address is easy to find, and there are no special instructions needed. They do not actually attempt to deliver any packages, they just don’t try at all. I don’t understand how they are getting away with this. I have filed BBB complaints three times about the same issue, I am about to do another complaint. It’s the same issue each and every time they are used for shipping. I am not exaggerating.Date of experience: September 14, 2023JPJP1 reviewUSUpdated Jul 26, 2023Recommend not buying from any company that uses this shipper.This company loses packages then lies about it. They say they attempted delivery or delivered, but cameras do not lie. They neither attempted, not delivered. If it was delivered to the wrong address, they have no record of it, such as a photo or GPS trace of the vehicle. If you call, you wait on hold forever, then they tell you they take no responsibility and tell you to inform the seller that the package was lost.  I will not but anything more from Temu until they stop using LaserShip.Update,  I've called numerous times. Their phone bank people are courteous, but can't help.  They \"escalate' to a manager and promise someone will call back with 2 hours. No one ever calls.  Read all the other reviews of this company, especially the Better Business Bureau.  It's amazing they can remain in businessDate of experience: July 21, 2023Rachel Toshkoff2 reviewsUSJul 26, 2023How is this company even still in business???I dread every time I see a package of mine is being shipped with this company.  It's pretty much guaranteed that my package is going to be at least a week late, if it ever shows up at all.  Currently waiting on a parcel that the seller has had ready to ship out for a week, and LaserShip has yet to even pick it up.Date of experience: July 26, 2023LTLinda T.2 reviewsUSNov 20, 2023Worst Shipping ServiceWorst Shipping Service, I have only had 2 packages never arrive and they have both been from this company.This time I had an order they decided to send to the wrong facility and now I get to deal with the BS to fix it due to their incompetence...THEY NEED TO BE OUT OF BUISNESS!!!!!

The owner should be arrested and this company should be shut down. I was supposed to have received a package on December 18th but there was no package. I have cameras all around my house and not one showed any delivery. I don't know why these retail companies use laser ship. Just look at the reviews people. Never heard of this company until recently!!!! I have some choice words for these people . Again another retail company decided to ho with this company and I don't expect to see this package. I'll be on the phone again with this retailer.Date of experience: December 18, 2022G C Wilson1 reviewUSSep 20, 20232 No Show OrdersMy order from Kohls placed on 8/22/23 supposedly arrived at the lasership facility, less than 5 miles from my home, on 08/27/23 but never made it to me. Each time I tracked, it was expected on the date I checked it. I sent a message to lasership on 09/01/23. I got an automated response that they were checking on it. I called Kohls on 09/05/23 to say I still hadn't received my order. They sent a replacement order but once again used lasership. I got an email from both Kohls & lasership on 09/11/23 that the original order had been delivered, which it had not. The replacement order supposedly arrived at the lasership facility on 09/07/23, again the facility is less than 5 miles from my home. I contacted Kohls on 09/19/23 & they have issued me a refund.Date of experience: August 27, 2023HHHaiba Hassan5 reviewsUSJan 22, 2023I dont understand were they always send my packagesThey alway dont deliver my packages, day before testerday they lost my sons package, today the lost my jacket from jc peny..they are horouble...from now on i will ask caurier befor presing my order..Date of experience: January 21, 2023MIMarcus Israel1 reviewUSDec 21, 2022Worst service.

They marked my package as delivered and literally no one showed up at my door or delivered anything D10013855673553.We have cameras all over the outside of the house and I was home when it was marked delivered and that is a blatant lie. No one resolves the status of my package.Date of experience: May 25, 2023Read 1 more review about LaserShipMAMaryAnn1 reviewUSSep 20, 2023DO NOT ORDER FROM ANY COMPANY USING LASERSHIP!Ordered an item from NHLSHOP.com.  The item arrived in a plastic bag.  Quite evident there was a tear in the bag.  LaserShip placed a sticky label over top of the tear.  Fortunately, the item was not damaged.  This is the WORST DELIVERY COMPANY I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED, AND I ORDER A LOT!!  I will not order again from any company that uses this totally inept service!!!Date of experience: September 18, 2023SBShauntai Bentley4 reviewsUSMar 6, 2023The absolute worstThe absolute worst, period. They leave packages in the lobby of large apartment buildings. In the Bronx!

Stated package delivered at 4:47. Open the door at 4:48 nothing. The package never came.  Companies who use this service must lose money on replacements.Date of experience: January 20, 2023GRGrailedSeller4 reviewsUSMay 7, 2023stolen packagesI only had experience with Laser Ship 2 times. Big companies like Nordstorm and Saks5th use them for some reason, and shipped my 1000$ item with Laser Ship.Well what do you know? Both times packages got stolen. At this point Im pretty sure its the delivery person or his assistance who do that. Because any other shipping company I used it never happened to me before. And whole laser ship is a mess. Avoid at all costDate of experience: May 04, 2023Tenija1 reviewUSAug 8, 2023My package was delivered to the wrong…My package was delivered to the wrong address and someone else took it. The delivery person  didn’t even bother to read the correct address number because mine is 166 and they left my package at 170. I can somewhat understand if they had dropped it off somewhere in the 160’s but come on! I understand mistakes happen and human error exists, but to not even double check addresses while in broad daylight is absurd. What upsets me even more about this, is that I had to request a refund from the company I ordered from even though they did nothing wrong and this is the complete and total fault of the incompetent and negligent deliver driver. I don’t even want them to resend my items because do not want to risk dealing with LaserShip again. LaserShip- I know it’s not your responsibility to teach adults how to read ,but at least make sure that the ones that are employed by you know how to!Date of experience: August 08, 2023SHShannon1 reviewUSMay 3, 2023AWFUL COMPANYCould not be more dissatisfied with this company and would give 0 stars if I could. They have messed up every delivery I have had with them. First time around they completely ignored my delivery instructions and just left my package outside our apartment building in the pouring rain. The next time they said a delivery was attempted when it clearly was not, I was home the whole time and no one showed up. The 3rd time and final straw was when they delivered my package to the completely wrong apartment building and just left it outside. Of course I couldn’t tell what building it was from the delivery photo so I had no way of finding it. Thankfully someone was honest and took it to our office. Really frustrating to read that everyone else is having the exact same issues. AVOID THIS COMPANY.Date of experience: May 02, 2023Jacinta Dunn1 reviewUSJan 27, 2023This company is the WORSTThis company is the WORST! They said they couldn't deliver my packages, then days later said they delivered my packages and took a picture. It was NOT my house. The drivers LIE! You also can NOT communicate with anyone there. No phone contact and no computer chat available.Date of experience: January 26, 2023NENee1 reviewUSJan 14, 2023Lasership is the worst!!!!Lasership is the worst!!!!! I ordered a package that was being shipped by Lasership that said delivered and I never received it. I contacted Lasership as well as the seller to file a complaint and all either could tell me was the packaged was delivered. I requested prof of delivery outside of the standard generic “delivered” message and no one could do. I asked to speak a manger the person who took the call acted as if I was speaking a foreign language saying she doesn’t have a manager name and number she can give me. I asked if there was another number I could call she acted as if she wasn’t aware of that as well. So now I’m out of my money and my package. This company need to be SHUT DOWN!!!!!  I will NEVER  order from a company that uses Lasership. This company is thieves and frauds. .Date of experience: January 12, 2023JAJaime1 reviewUSMay 30, 20242 Missing Packages in 3 weeksI've had 2 recent orders with a major brand lost in shipment (within 3 weeks of each other).  The first order said the item was received by OnTrac and out for delivery the same day they received it.  After 3 days of not receiving the package, I reached out to OnTrac and was told that they could not locate my package and I needed to reach out to the seller to resolve the issue.  Then i get an update 2 days later that says the item was delivered.  I checked all the locations around my house and nothing was delivered.  So i reached out again asking for verification of the delivery, and was again told that they could not locate my package and to reach out to the seller.  With the 2nd missing package, I had the seller reach out to OnTrac and they were advised that they could not locate the package.  But I have to wait so many days before they can assist by issuing a refund.  The LaserShip/OnTrac customer service is nonexistent.  I am worried about a 3rd order that i placed to replace the missing 2nd order, will it be lost as well? I'd love to know what happens to all of these \"missing\" packages.Date of experience: May 29, 2024DADan2 reviewsUSJan 11, 2023HorribleHorrible!  I had four packages in five days delivered to the wrong address.  They took a picture of the package at the front door for the first three from BBW.  It was not my front door.  The fourth one, from Marley Spoon, they did not bother with a picture.  I contacted them and they basically said it was delivered, contact the seller, case closed.

I had to contact customer service and then was told sorry but we are having a higher than normal support requests and it will take 72 hrs to investigate.

Lazership/Ontrac has lost 2 packages and refuses to even return a message . Temu has already issued the $5 for each order delivered late . Lazership has delivered 2 more packages since losing the other 2 and still hasn't responded about the prior 2. If I do not receive both by 9/12/23 Temu will issue a full refund but I needed the packages as they contained birthday presents , to late now . I have also informed Temu I will not longer order if Lazership/Ontrac is the only choice for delivery and I order at least 10 times a month and spends hundreds every month . The issue isn't Temu but the sorry excuse they are using to deliver purchases. Lazership isn't answering Temu either . They changed the status on the tracking website from having picked up my packages from the airport and on the way to now No delivery updates for 6 days. There is absolutely no reason a delivery company should be allowed to not even send an email, call, text something. I haven't spoken to a human ,only the useless bot that says over and over \" in transit\" sent numerous emails ,messages in the website and Temu has tried to get them to answer , they refuse.Date of experience: September 09, 2023Amy Coleman1 reviewUSSep 21, 2023I am baffled they are still in…I am baffled they are still in business.Twice now my Butcherbox order shows delivered but no where to be found.  No picture either, like they are supposed to.  My guess, the delivery driver steals my $200+ dollars worth of meat.  Lasership does nothing but say, it was delivered.  I live in a rural area, no one is taking it off my porch.  Plus I work from home and my camera's show no one was here at the time.  Hoping Butcherbox will send another box AGAIN and hoping that one makes it to me.Date of experience: September 21, 2023Merlene Tipton Amoss1 reviewUSSep 11, 2023never ever use lasership!!!my package is 1 hour from my home, lasership claims it's out for deliver for the past 6 days. After calling the place I ordered from they called lasership to find out what was going on. I got a full refund along with my new jeans I ordered for winter if they ever show up. After I got off the phone lasership changed the status of my order as delayed.Date of experience: September 11, 2023TLTeresa Ley3 reviewsUSAug 1, 2023Doesn't deliver packages let's them sit in their warehouseHorrible company leaves your packages sit in their warehouse for days on end.

I also arrived home an hour after it was supposed delivered and confirmed there was no package. It has been 2 days since I opened a case and they doubled down on my package being delivered.

When I checked with the concierge (who looked for my package in all three mailrooms), I was told there is a Mike that works in my complex but he wasn't working at the time of the supposed delivery. I was also told that my complex has had multiple issues with OnTrac and that the drivers refuse to follow delivery procedures and just leave packages in random spots around the complex. I'm so sad that @OldNavy chooses to use OnTrac because now I can no longer be a customer.

Can't believe a billion dollar company like Walmart would do business with these people. The robot was more helpful than the employees. My package was delayed 4 days. All they could tell me was everything the robot said. Like what's the purpose of paying people to say the same thing a chat bot can do. This company needs to be cancelled! One star is a compliment for this company. Just cancel your order if you see them. 9 out of 10 you're not getting the package. And they'll tell you to get a refund and an automated apology from a very \"concerned and caring\" bot.Date of experience: September 26, 2024SBSymon B1 reviewUSSep 17, 2024Horrible Delivery ServiceHorrible Delivery ServiceIf I could give less than a star for a review I honestly would. I provided OnTrac with delivery instructions and they did not pull through. The driver didn't even get out of his vehicle. All the driver did was roll the window down and toss the package out. The package contained a computer part for a pickup that was being delivered under warranty as it is. They should not be allowed to be in operation as this isn't even the first time.

The driver called her supervisor and he stated they don't deliver to the post office because they are their competition.  Like what?!  Your drivers job is to deliver the packages to the addresses on said packages, and you won't let them!

I ordered a shapermint camisole that was through Nordstrom in California and I'm in Oregon. I'd think that was an easy one. The delays have started now, like everyone else!  I hope there is reasonable answer for all this craziness but I'm losing confidence in ONTRAC! Although I have actually seen one of their beat-up looking vans in our parking lot before so they must get it right SOMTIME?!

About a week later I received an email saying the package was delivered at midnight, which was obviously untrue. I didn't get it.

I called Moubtain Hardware customer service expanding that no package was delivered. They did an “investigation” and determined OnTrac never delivered the package - IE OnTrac also lied about it. I have packages from every other delivery service deliver packages daily/weekly for 20 years - never had a problem until OnTrac. Avoid at all cost.

They’re now blaming it on the actual locker and telling me to have my apartment complex open it…. Except my apartment manager told me no package is listed under my unit meaning the driver fat fingered the unit number. Ontrac will blame anyone and make you wait days to weeks before rectifying the situation - don’t use them even if they’re your only option, you’re better off picking up from a store or delivering stuff yourself/through anyone elseDate of experience: September 07, 2024AdvertisementISIRENE S4 reviewsUSAug 28, 2024If I could give no stars I wouldIf I could give no stars I would.  This company is worthless.  Home Depot uses them for shipments to be delivered.  They lose shipments - state the item was delivered when it wasn't - state shipment is delayed.

This company deserves a negative star.  Out of the 4 packages that I have ordered from large retail companies that have used OnTrac I have yet to receive any of those 4 packages. Every time OnTrac gives a different excuse: package undeliverable, package delayed, packages left a front door (yet was never left). There is not a human to talk to at this company so you never receive any help. Their bots claim to generate a ticket and will investigate but you will never hear back from them. Every time I have to contact the seller and ask for a replacement and pay extra to have them use FedEx, UPS, USPS, anything that will actually deliver to my house. I receive Amazon packages almost daily so it’s not like I live in an undeliverable area. I have never come across a more dysfunctional company. I really believe they have been stealing my packages.

Companies I used to love ordering from like Vitacost, iHerb, The Children’s Place and Carter’s to name a few, all use this service which used to be called Lasersh*t or Lasership. The drivers just throw boxes from the bottom of the stairs or deliver to the wrong house. They don’t follow delivery instructions and their customer service is a joke. Wish we could get this company shut down. The reason they merged is because of all the bad reviews Lasership was getting. If you look up reviews for them, they’re the same rating as OnTrac.

I only ordered it in the first place because they promised next day delivery.They (home Depot) are still promising next day delivery on their website for a new order.

They responded and essentially told me that yes, my package had arrived, and they’d deliver it whenever. But to keep in mind that they don’t have a turnaround time. Which is absolutely absurd to me but I digress.

This is how they treat customers packages... horrible merchants need to stop using this garbage shipping company... so many complaints on BBB and reported them to the FTC... they are thieves .... never using a merchant who use them as a shipping vendor...Date of experience: December 22, 2023SASandy1 reviewUSSep 20, 2023My husband ordered $600 worth of…My husband ordered $600 worth of cologne from Nordstrom (creed & Chanel).

They delivered my package to wrong address. Which was delivered in another city. They do not take ownership for delivering to wring address. Even showing then the invoices showing the email on file to deliver to, they still claim they deliver to correct address and will not do anything to fix it.  They are  giving out people addresses. They gave the the address to the home where my package was delivered, which is a big hippa violation. I could of easily got in my car and drove there to the people house to get my package.Date of experience: October 02, 2023AdvertisementKathryn Vogel1 reviewUSJun 21, 2023“Lost” packages for years, won’t support companies that use LSOTerrible company. I’ve been dealing with “lost” packages for years because the companies I purchase from choose to use LSO. The only thing I can do about that is to stop ordering from Nordstrom and the others until they finally get it together and start using a legitimate shipping company. Not worth the hassle, definitely don’t trust LSO or the companies that continue to use them, and really disappointed that every single experience with them has been just as bad as the last.Date of experience: June 01, 2023marquisha jiles1 reviewUSJan 11, 2024If I can put NO STARS I WILLIf I can put NO STARS I WILL !

Watching the tracking on my package reminds me of playing pinball, but a lot less fun. It’s “out for delivery”, but then no, it moves farther away. Then, instead of going to the residential address, it seems to have gone to some business that was “closed”, and had “no access”. I alerted them to the error and resent them the address (even though the address they already had was correct). I even sent them a photo of the house. I’ve also sent them a Google Maps link to the exact location. Several days later, still nothing.The company’s email responses are formulaic assurances that my inquiry is “under research” and will receive the “highest priority”. Very clearly, the customer service rep has a readily available collection of stock replies tailored to increasingly irate inquiries. But, equally clearly, no action is ever actually taken. So yeah, I’ve pretty much given up hope that the package will arrive in my lifetime. Deliveries really don’t get much simpler than this one, folks, and they still can’t manage it.Date of experience: March 14, 2024AdvertisementRachael Vaughan1 reviewUSApr 28, 2023Never got my orderI ordered somethings from temu and my order was moving pretty fast until it got to the states and LSO took over.

I would suggest using other delivery companies than this one.Date of experience: April 12, 2023Lily Lamoreq1 reviewUSJun 15, 2023LSO should go out of businessI don’t ever try to be rude about a company or bash a compay but this company is absolutely outrageous. I have NEVER been more angry. They didn’t communicate with me about my package being lost and still tried to lie and say it was on its way. I have waited for 2 WEEKS and even sent 2 request to speak to someone. Only after contacting the actual company the order came from, they confirmed they LOST MY PACKAGE.

Out of 3 packages I only received one, it was LATE, and the box was cut open. Shein was very easy to deal with and were prompt with issuing me a refund, but I would have love to have had my items. Not ordering from anyone who uses LSO.Date of experience: April 19, 2023AdvertisementRebecca S.2 reviewsUSDec 14, 2023Avoid buying online from anyone shipping with LSOHad two packages from Nordstrom with delivery dates of 11/29 and 12/4. Both dates have come and gone with no package. On 12/4, I contacted Nordstrom regarding the package I was expecting on 11/29, and just so happened to screenshot the tracking information. Funny how I went to LSO’s website to see if there had been any movement  and it was updated to say delivered 12/1 at 12:00pm. Weird, it didn’t say that on 12/4! The 12/4 package is still MIA, but I’m sure that’ll get a fake delivery date as well. People need to keep screen shots of this crap because I could've been responsible for hundreds of dollars worth of “delivered” merchandise that I didn’t actually receive. That is truly alarming. Are they processing so many shipments stuff is falling through the cracks, or is there some kind of fraud/theft occurring? Truly seems odd to me that out of nowhere there is updated tracking on a package that’s already been reported as missing.Date of experience: December 13, 2023JVJorge Vargas2 reviewsUSAug 23, 2023This company lets their drivers mark…This company lets their drivers mark packages as delivered when they actually never deliver the package.

I’ve ordered from Fashion Nova twice and for some reason they keep using this incompetent company as a delivery service. The first time I ordered my package never came and then it was updated as lost even I tracked it. This time my package was suppose to be delivered on August 20th. It’s now August 23rd and tracking still says it was scanned at a center in my city 3 days ago. Any company that is using LSO delivery will not receive my business because they are unreliable. Something needs to be done about this company because they keep getting away with this and you have to go through a lot to get your money back.Date of experience: August 23, 2023AdvertisementJames Leon1 reviewUSApr 25, 2023Oh my anytime you order something and…Oh my anytime you order something and it says LSO tracking, just go ahead and cancel that order.

They either fail to update their tracking, constantly change the delivery date, even if you paid for expedited shipping, or they straight up deliver your package to the wrong address, which is my latest issue. My saving grace was the driver taking a picture of my package at the wrong address, even though it shows delivered at the correct address. It’s terrifying knowing that their drivers failed to verify basic information or at the least use GPS. That’s incompetence for no reason, and now I have to wait for LSO to figure out what they’re gonna do next. I bet they save companies a ton of money as their delivery service, but terrible experiences over and over, will make a loyal customer jump ship.Date of experience: August 14, 2023Gavin Enriquez2 reviewsUSApr 22, 2023Really Terrible ServiceI ordered something through Temu that originally said it was shipping through USPS, but eventually got picked up through LSO. I received a notification saying my package was delivered, but it wouldn't tell me where. I couldn't find it in my mailbox, outside my home, and none of my neighbors said they have it. I tried to contact them during their business hours multiple times and each time I called it said they weren't taking calls. Which honestly baffles me as I've never had that happen before with other shipping companies. I've encountered automatic response systems and long hold times, but never a company tell me they aren't taking calls during a week day. I had to get it reshipped and refunded since some of the items I bought are out of stock now. If I ever see another package shipped through this company again, I might just call the seller and get that changed as soon as possible.Date of experience: April 17, 2023Jaylee Brown1 reviewUSFeb 28, 2024This company is beyond trashThis company is beyond trash, they told me they were unable to deliver my package due to “unable to access” after I gave very very specific instruction's.

It sat for a week at one of the local sorting sites, according to its tracking. Then all of a sudden said it was delivered. Which they backdated a day once I called Nordstrom to inquire about the packages whereabouts. It was never delivered. Just lost or stolen. All LSO companies phone numbers are out of service. You can look up up some of the upper management contact info in the internet. So maybe I'll try them. But seems like the company is on its last leg. Needs to go. If you are a company.

I provided my cell phone# and email address with the order, but no one has tried to contact me. If the problem is that they need the gate code, why would they come back a 2nd time without contacting me? The gate is still going to be there. They have no phone number and have not responded to the messages that I send through their website. Amazon/Fedex/UPS deliver to me all the time w/o a problem.

They are incompetent and unreliable with what they are open to do which is deliver packages. I have had them unfortunately as my carrier 5 times and 3 of those times I didn’t receive my package. They fraudulently sign your package and mark it delivered. It’s so shameful that companies are still using LSO. You would think that the seller would be losing out on money for having to refund customers and losing the product. I’m wondering does the seller file insurance claims on lost goods and get a nice lump sum from it? It has to be something in it for them to use a company that is clearly fraudulent. It’s no secret and its not hard to find reviews on how sh@@ty this company is. I have completely stopped ordering from places when I find out LSO is being used and before I order from new places I will email or call customer service before I spend money with them.

I ordered from Shein on March 27th. Tracking shows…3-30 arrived at local facility4-3 @ 3:34 Houston inbound scan @ destination. 4-3 @ 14:51 in transit Houston alternate day service. Hasn’t moved since. I have tried contacting the company multiple time with no response. I contacted BBB and the company responded through them with an apology about the issue. They said they would get back with me. I kept responding I don’t accept the response. The BBB has closed the case saying the customer (me) was not satisfied. I still don’t know what happened to my package. I don’t know if it’s lost or sitting in a warehouse. I just wish the company would at least give me a response.

They are constantly putting me on hold or transferring me to someone who never answers. They don't know where my freight is. Horrible customer service. I am giving up and filing a police report for stolen freight but wanted to warn others to never work with them. Absolute disaster.Date of experience: October 17, 2023KSKamila Stanisch3 reviewsUSDec 6, 2023Five days of waiting and still no deliveryThis company has told us for five days in a row that our item will be delivered. So for five days, one of us has been home all day waiting for delivery and nothing has arrived. They keep telling us the drivers have a lot of deliveries and simply can't make all the deliveries. I'm not sure how a delivery company can continue to operate if they \"simply can't make all the deliveries.\" Do not use this company if you actually want an item to be delivered as they are incapable.Date of experience: December 06, 2023BEBen1 reviewUSMay 3, 2023They lost my shipment twice and if I…They lost my shipment twice and if I didn't hold their hand through the entire process and call them every da, I'm 100% certain that the shipment never would have arrived. A 6 day delivery took almost 1 mont and if had taken any longer, a multi-year scientific project would have gone down the drain. I was close to flying to the random transit point my shipment was stuck at, renting a u-haul, and delivering it myself. NEVER use this company.Date of experience: May 02, 2023BRBrenda Reger2 reviewsUSJun 6, 2023If I could give them zero stars I…If I could give them zero stars I would. They had explicit instructions to deliver our pallet to our detached garage, which is halfway down our driveway. They instead dropped our expensive delivery at the end of our driveway. They never came to the door to see if anyone was home.

Confused as to why he wasn't able to get into the door seeing as there are concierges there to open it, I go downstairs only to not be able to find the delivery driver or my package. Walk around the block to the back entrance to find my package sitting outside on the sidewalk. Thanks for calling me to let me know you were at the building at least? Worst delivery company.Date of experience: November 12, 2023Mickey Wright Harris1 reviewUSMay 24, 2023I wish I could rate T Force Final Mile…I wish I could rate T Force Final Mile five zero stars!! Ordered fifteen kitchen cabinets from Home Depot and when they arrived late there were eight badly damaged. Their tracking is like non existent and customer service is useless. So I reordered the damaged cabinets again from Home Depot and guess what, every one of them were so badly damaged that T Force didn't even deliver them, just sent them back to Home Depot. Can't believe Home Depot even contracts with a one star rated sloppy freight company. Guess my next review is headed for Home Depot.Date of experience: May 23, 2023Bryce Gibby1 reviewUSDec 4, 2023New door panel destroyed by Tforce FreightTForce delivered new door panels for a Samsung refrigerator warranty issue. One door was well wrapped and secured to a pallet--but the pallet was broken and the box was entirely exposed on one end. When the installer came by to replace the door on the fridge and finished opening the box, the warranty door was not just dinged, but totally perforated--ruined!Date of experience: November 27, 2023teeners1 reviewUSJun 18, 2023Package never came, never even got updatedFor some reason, American Eagle decided to use Tforce to ship my order. I was really excited to finally have a pair of jeans that fit me, since they offer shorter cut jeans online. However, tforce never updated the tracking on my package, the single update they gave me made no sense, “package info has been provided but item has not been received for delivery.” After two weeks, still no package. I have no idea what happened to it, there’s not a single update to even know if it’s coming. I’m just going to get a refund, but I don’t know why anyone would use this awful shipping company.Date of experience: June 18, 2023Karen Williams2 reviewsUSMar 13, 2024Tforce never delivers my packages!!Tforce never delivers my packages!!!

They refused to deliver my freight saying they can't turn a tractor trailer around.  We built a turnaround and have tractor trailers here 3-4 times a month with no issues.  I would never use this company if I was sending anything.  They are formerly UPS freight I have learned. We learned long ago we pay extra money to have other companies deliver our freight so  we don't have to deal with their sour attitudes. I told the company I purchased from they better be getting a refund since they can't be bothered to do the job they paid for.Date of experience: January 17, 2024SCShelton Contracting & Paint LL2 reviewsUSApr 20, 2023What a joke, not laughingFirst they destroyed my original order after taking 2 weeks to get it close to me. So after having to reorder they decide to take at least 4 more days than their original delivery date. Never thought ordering a ladder would be so difficult not to mention the fact that their delays and failures are literally costing me money by the day. Customer service is a joke, but at least my local people are good. I would rather pay extra than let them ship anything else for me.Date of experience: April 04, 2023CUcustomer4 reviewsUSApr 20, 2023They're horribleThey're horrible.  They arrived wanting a check for shipping, without ever notifying that one was needed.  The website is useless, so I couldn't pay online.  The first call to provide a credit card number resulted in being told to call back in an hour.  When I called back, I gave the card number, got a confirmation email, and then an email the next day form someone else there that payment was required.

I have only ever had a great experience with UPS Freight and now the horrible T-Force is not even a thought any more for my company or for any company needing Freight.

I had read all the terrible reviews and did not know what to expect. Well, I was pleasantly surprised, Sheri called the morning of delivery and told me exactly when to expect the driver.  The driver, Frank, was very pleasant and helpful. He called approximately 25 minutes before the delivery and did everything he could to make this a pleasant experience.  He was able to maneuver that huge truck into a very tight spot and unload my big package.  Thank you so much Frank, you were awesome.

The most HORRIBLE company in the shipping business. The WORST freight company in North America. I have shipped a shipment with TForce freight with an estimated transit time of 5 days, but my shipment arrived 79 days after the shipping date. Their initial pick-up was timely and then the game begins. They damaged our pallets and lost our product because they didn't care about their customers. Also, they don't have any customer service as well.Date of experience: October 18, 2022Seamy Ten1 reviewUSAug 31, 2023Such a horrid experience!If there is any way to give this company minus 10 stars, I would.

Best to avoid companies like this that have absolutely no respect for customers!Date of experience: August 31, 2023Mitra Samavaki1 reviewCAJan 22, 2024Unsatisfactory Delivery Experience: Missing Zara Package Handled by T ForceI bought items from Zara, and the delivery was split into two parts. One part was handled by this company, T Force. Unfortunately, I never received the package, and it seems to have been stolen from our mailroom. This was my first experience with T Force, and it turned out to be the worst delivery experience ever. They provided a proof of delivery showing the package in the mailroom, but when I checked with the building management, they couldn't find any record of the package. Normally, other delivery companies either leave packages at your door, call you, or leave a notice for you to pick up the package from a post store. However, T Force simply left it in our mailroom, and it was stolen.Date of experience: January 10, 2024RARap2 reviewsCANov 30, 2023They should hire people with common senseTerrible experienced with this company, leaving my package at my fromt porch at night at the edge of my porch.

Hope I never have to deal with this outfit again.Date of experience: August 25, 2023Brandon Patrick1 reviewUSJan 23, 2024Don’t ever use this companyDon’t ever use this company. They will lie straight to your face. I purchased something and for some reason they choose to ship through TForce. This was a mistake this was a very small 1 pound envelope and I had to start a claim with the vendor because TForce lied about making a delivery. They classified my home address as a business and tried to deliver an envelope at 10pm. In fact my cameras never captured anyone or a vehicle at 10 pm so Im not sure why they lied to me . I contacted their customer service for resolution and they said “ we tried to deliver it but the business was closed” lmao I guess you were able to avoid my cameras. Please make sure who ever you buy from does not use the BS shipping company because you may very well never get your items.Date of experience: January 22, 2024DIDisappointed1 reviewUSMay 6, 2024Curbside Delivery Only?!?This is the comment I sent to T-Force, but even their Customer Service website is garbage - it wouldn't send my comment!Before submitting this review, I researched other on-line reviews at Trustpilot and Reddit.  The opinions were nearly all in agreement with mine: T-Force sucks.  I was told 4 days prior that my delivery would occur between 10am and noon; it arrived at 2-30pm.  Not overly professional, but I can live with some lateness.  What I found totally unsatisfactory was a company policy that delivers curbside only - T-Force trucks are not allowed to go down customers' driveways.  Why? What kind of lazy policy is that?!  My house is 100+ yards from the road down a paved driveway.  I called Dispatch and a manager, but both were useless with give-a-crap attitudes.  The Reddit reviewers are totally correct: T-Force is garbage.  I will NEVER willingly use T-force again, and I will specifically ask my next vender what shipper they plan to use; if its T-Force, I'll cancel my order.  T-Force is one of the reasons America is sliding into a failing state - they're a crooked, lazy, cheap company. Please go bankrupt.Date of experience: May 06, 2024Big Kahuna1 reviewCAJul 17, 2023These guys are a jokeThese guys are a joke.

I wasn't home the day of the delivery, but we spoke through the Ring doorbell. He agreed to push the boxes into my  garage.

I called dispatch was on hold for 20 min for them to tell me they wasn't going to deliver, dahhh dude no kidding that why im calling. Then he started in on the apology, soooo not buying it, it was VERY obvious he was reading off a script that he has to read to people all day long.

I was able to track the item from TForce Freight's web site throughout the journey up north, I tracked every day, which was very cool. The oven arrived at Manchester, New Hampshire Shipping Center, I called for an appointment for the oven to be delivered to my residential home and was asked what day would be good for me, customer service and the people that set up the delivery were incredible, polite and very professional. The driver even helped me push the 1250 pound pizza oven up the driveway with my dolly.  We get deliveries every day from all the shipping companies, TForce Freight is by far the best we have dealt with.  Thanks to everyone at TForce Freight, great job.Date of experience: November 13, 2023VIVitillo1 reviewUSSep 28, 2023TForce is not reliableTForce is not reliable. They re-schedule pick ups with out the customers approval or knowledge. No call, no email and no update given by Tforce. They claim the truck drivers do not come to Gloucester MA a lot so that is why... this was not told to us when scheduling or Quoted, when paying almost 3 grand for them to pick up here they do not even bother to call or let us know this information. When paying a truck company to pick up a Freight order it should not matter if they truck doesnt come to this area alot... It should still be picked up on the scheduled day they told us when we booked this. Called and was told that they re-scheduled 4 times without our knowledge AND was advised to cancel and re-book with a different truck carrier. WOW! Horrible...Date of experience: September 28, 2023SIMONE PILARSKI1 reviewUSSep 2, 2023This company is an absolute nightmareThis company is an absolute nightmare. Shipping has been delayed by 5 days while my 3k package (a couch) sits on a truck a few miles away until they can find a lift gate they say. I’ve called multiple times and customer service is so rude and dances around the issue by saying they will have someone call me back- they never do. I’ll be shocked if i get my package in the next week with how crappy of a company this is. They have already set up 2 delivery days in which i had to be gone from work and never delivered on either. Nightmare company !Date of experience: September 02, 2023Cynthia Rae1 reviewUSApr 14, 2023If I could give 0 starsIf I could give 0 stars, I would. Quoted $299 for a shipment, paid via credit card. Now they are trying to collect an additional $685 that was undisclosed at the time the shipment was set up. No one answers the phone nor do they return email correspondence. WARNING!!!!! They are NOT reputable. Bait and switch company.Date of experience: April 12, 2023Delta Massage1 reviewUSOct 4, 2023The worst communication ever, will my order ever arrive?The worst communication ever! $300 was paid for shipping and the product sits 30 miles from this house and can't seem to get here. We were told since we are rural that the truck doesn't come this way very often..if they can't deliver to my area in a timely manner they shouldn't be taking the orders. I need this product to run my business and I've been on hold now for three weeks ago at least. Customers can't contact the hub directly because they would give no phone number. I'm suspecting this company is a sham and don't know what to even do to get my product.Date of experience: October 04, 2023Landi Gonzalez1 reviewUSApr 23, 2023I've had multiple packages from…I've had multiple packages from different companies delivered unsuccessfully to me using Tforce. The warning message is always that the package is \"unsafe to release\". I have never had any issues with receiving packages from any other shipping company except for this one. I don't understand why so many retailers are partnering with them to deliver packages when they're just going to be lost in the mail. If you see that your package is being delivered by TForce, you might as well cut your losses or repurchase the items you want and pick it up in store.Date of experience: April 22, 2023BHBetsy Horvat7 reviewsUSDec 4, 2023Never received packageI was supposed to receive a package to be delivered by T-Force on December 1.  On that morning, the tracking info said that it was out for delivery.  Later in the day, it switched to pending, then for the next two days it said no information was available.  Then on the afternoon of the third day, it suddenly said that the package was delivered on December 1.  I contacted them and they insisted that the package had been delivered on December 1.  I was home all day and nothing was delivered.  When I questioned them, they just replied that the driver had delivered the package to the right address and didn't answer any further emails. I don't know how they stay in business.Date of experience: December 03, 2023LGLarry Gutman3 reviewsUSJun 26, 2024I tracked it down or I still wouldn't have it.I ordered an item that was shipped from the east coast on June 7. I found out on June 21 using the tracking number It had arrived in my local terminal on June 17.  I went in person to see if I could pick it up.  The person in the office gave me information I had reason to believe was not accurate, but I was told I could pick it up the next day ay Will Call.  The next day I returned at the time I was told it was still loaded on a truck and would take 15 to 20 minutes to get it out.  The reason I gave them the second star was because the gentleman that talked to me next gave me information I believed - it was in one of the trailers but he would pull it out - it would take about 20 minutes.  They were short staffed.  He got my shipment - he was friendly and honest with me.  I had never heard of this company until now, but I would not use them under the circumstances.Date of experience: June 25, 2024CHCharisse1 reviewUSMay 26, 2023TForce + Nordstrom RackI bought items from Nordstrom Rack and this carrier did not bother to CALL or even KNOCK at least when they were outside the gate! Based on their tracking history, they tried to deliver the items three times. I even left a note (for their second try) to just leave it by the gate! Their fourth attempt, they just changed the tracking status to \"unable to deliver etc\". No one was even outside! I'm sorry Nordstrom but because of this, you will also receive a low feedback. Better partner up with a good carrier next time!Date of experience: May 10, 2023TFTom Fenske1 reviewUSAug 9, 2023Tforce has taken 14 days to move a…Tforce has taken 14 days to move a 210lb pinbox from Missouri to Washington State. So far, 12 of those days were the item sitting in two different depos. Tforce does not care about anyone’s time just their fing bottom line. The item is currently sitting in Utah waiting for what I assume a full truck. It is now two days behind schedule. They just move the estimated delivery date to the next day. Regardless of what a realistic estimate is. I would never hire them unless an item was ordered months ahead of when it is needed. They are a joke. It would be a great place to start a trucking company they have everything you need just bring your integrity and customer service then you’ll have something. Welcome to Biden’s world and one step closer to Cold War era socialism where you stand in long lines for your stale liar of bread ration.Date of experience: August 08, 2023NINorm Irwin2 reviewsUSApr 19, 2024Shippers Beware, these guys might cost you customers Well let me begin by saying that I will never personally use this freight company again, nor will I purchase anything from a vendor that uses them for their freight. They are a foreign owned company and don't really care about the end user. My freight was literally 6 hours away in Springfield MO. I am in Oklahoma City OK. It has now been 10 days since pickup and 4 days past projected delivery date (7 days later). I have created 2 different case numbers trying to find out where my freight is at. Their customer service rep can't schedule the delivery or tell me when they will call me to schedule delivery. She can however tell me it has been at my local hub since yesterday. Yet no one has called me to schedule delivery. Even though it is already several days past the projected delivery date. So now it will be next week at the earliest.  The board of this company needs to fire the CEO and hire someone that knows how to run a freight company. Date of experience: April 17, 2024Ukiah Wheeler1 reviewUSSep 1, 2023Terrible communicationI scheduled a pallet to go out via freight and it got delayed for several days until it was finally picked up. Each day I was greeted with attitude when I called the customer service line to see what was going on and why pickup was delayed. Now, here I am 2 days later with my order still not on the road because I was told that the driver lost the paperwork and they don’t know if I was billed (which I was). This company is failing in every aspect and it’s the last time I’ll ever use them.Date of experience: August 27, 2023Matthew Beeman1 reviewUSMar 29, 2023T-Force is one of the worst carriersSince UPS became T-Force they have become one of the worst carriers in the nation! DO NOT USEScheduled a pick up on Tuesday morning and it was not picked up, this can happen and is understandable.Called Wednesday morning and was told we were the drivers 2nd pick up, called again at 2:45pm and was told the drivers ETA was 3-3:30pm, called again at 3:30pm and was told the driver was 10 miles away and we were the next stop. 50 minutes pass, call again and was told we were rescheduled.TLDR: Didn't pick up the day scheduled. Instead of being a priority the next day, was lied to by 3 CSR's and then rescheduled.Date of experience: March 29, 2023LALarry1 reviewUSAug 28, 2023I found the tforce dispatch and driver…I found the tforce dispatch and driver to be very helpful.Driver Nolen called ahead, was timely and pleasant.My shipment appeared to be 100% undamaged-- not even the typical scuffs/scrapes I see on the outside of LTL wooden shipping crates.Date of experience: August 25, 2023STStacie5 reviewsUSNov 19, 2023Got My Product Fast & NO Damage!My shipment of fragile terrazzo tile arrived SO fast.  It came from Chantilly, VA to a tiny town in Texas in only 3 days!  Excellent shipment, they took great care of my beloved terrazzo tile pallet.Thank you!!!Date of experience: November 17, 2023JAJames5 reviewsUSUpdated Apr 13, 2024tFARSEfeight should be the their true nameI wanted to ship a painting to donate to a museum in California. I called the 800 number and set up the shipment and prepaid by credit card and was given a pickup date immediately. The painting was not picked up, so I called back only to be told that the order was cancelled for no reason, so they set it up again with a new pickup date. The LOCAL pick up guy later called to say they don't ship art. Then they refused to refund my credit card prepayment. Oh, and by the way, they quoted me over $2,100 on the job. I later got it done for $349. So they’re gougers too. Date of experience: April 08, 2024STSteve1 reviewUSJun 8, 2023Why is my engine not here?!!!!Have an engine coming that was supposed to be here today.  Finally tracked down who was shipped with.  Been sitting in Portland Or for 5 days.  Then sat in Medford Or for 3 more days. Called the local office where my engine is sitting.  Said Mount Shasta, ca is a rural route that we only deliver to on Wednesdays.  We were short staff today so your order will be there till next Wednesday. My truck currently in dodge dealer with engine pulled waiting for new one that still says will be delivered by tonight @ 7pm.  $140.00 an hour sitting there waiting for the engine!   The gal said sorry sir, I don’t know what to tell you, won’t be there till next Wednesday, one week from promised time of today!!!!Date of experience: June 06, 2023alicia stein1 reviewUSJul 1, 2023If I can give them a zero I wouldIf I can give them a zero I would. For Christmas I had ordered all off my gifts which they were suppose to be delivered , they statused the package as delivered but never did, Two days ago again theystated a package was delivered and in fact it never was . I live in a building with cameras , the videos were reviewed and they never delivered the package. Our packages are being stolen and the worst thing about it is that they are getting away with it. What are the owners of tforce doing about this? This is called high way robbery! Why are these employees not being held accountable for there actions? They who represent T force .Date of experience: June 29, 2023NHNot Happy1 reviewUSFeb 24, 2024Zero stars if it were an optionZero stars if it were an option. Review score indicates the absolute absurd and terrible freight company this is!They are a SCAM! Why do I say this? They have repeatedly non-stop fraudulently billed \"Limited Access Fee\" of $175.00 on EVERY SINGLE INVOICE and EVERY DELIVERY LOCATION! We deliver to businesses with established shipping and receiving docks! I now have 3 invoices, 3 separate locations, all billed this fraudulent charge, like nearly every single invoice that has come before it! I call, I email, I call, I email... it takes months before they respond and remove the charge... it is now Feb. 23rd, 2024, and have been working on the last invoice since December 7, 2023, without resolve.If I could get back the time for all of the phone calls and emails trying to deal with them! It's time to switch Freight Company, wish I would have last year!And, online quotes for freight are always less that what you actually get billed! Expect to get billed MORE than what you are told!Date of experience: February 23, 2024FAFAll10 reviewsUSAug 25, 2023A shty companyA shty company. They damaged our product and concealed with like color shrink wrap to mask the damage. On top of that they declined claim saying I signed it. Yes I signed it because they masked the damaged with similar color shrink wrap so I didn't see the damage at the time of signing.

Did not get my order delivered.EDIT: After contacting Amazon live chat, I was told that it was damaged in transit and thus couldn't be delivered, and that it was marked as delivered. Amazon gave me my money back. I've changed it to be 2/5 stars instead of 1/5 because I'm not sure who's mistake this was, but I cannot rate it more than 2/5 stars based on the nonexistent customer service/support. Disgusting. Did not get my order through Amazon, then when I reached out by WhatsApp messaging, I got a reply with a \"How can we help?\" and after sending a message I never got a reply after that. Then I called a few days later, and the call was picked up and it was just utter silence, no response, nothing.

I ordered a parcel and received an email stating this company would deliver it. 3 weeks later I had not received it, nor a failed delivery card. I have a ring doorbell and had not missed a delivery. I checked tracking and they claimed to have tried to deliver the item twice. I e-mailed and had a call a few days later, they admitted the driver had not taken a photo of my door, which means they hadn’t tried to deliver it. I’m arranged a delivery time and finally got my package (late). After that, I got an e-mail stating they had my parcel and could I ring to arrange delivery.

Send me an invoice for import VAT duty, misspelled my name and input a wrong address into their internal consignment note system! Got their 3rd party parcel tracker to inform the delivery was unsuccessful and the courier service would return the parcel to sender. I am extremely upset and stressed over this! This is the most unreliable freight forwarding company I had to encounter and they seriously consider selling the business to someone who knows what they are doing! Day light robbery! Now I have to check with my supplier and Consumer Rights if I could recoup my losses if the delivery fails. This company might be a fraud, like how on earth do you get the postal code so wrong?

SkyNet's phones are NEVER answered, my car registration was due yesterday, SkyNet NEVER contacted me, and is totally UNREACHABLE. NOW TWO DAYS, AND NO RESPONSE AT ALL.  It seems as though a Carousel of  Incompetents happily runs this disaster unit, and they take NO responsibility to answer phones. God forbid they had to speal with customers.  They have a 1,3 STAR rating - I would not brag - (it starts at 1).  I am so angry, I do not want to put the words that I want - it will reflect on me.  Lazy, indifferent, incompetent, entitled and useless - doesn't get much worse than this. I would like a refund of the time they had me waste, the air time also wasted without even answering.

By The time you see this review it might be too late... Skynet had a hijacking with one of our parcels. They take no responsibility for our lost parcels and they initially uploaded our POD Image to say it was successful and marked it as delivered on Monday 21/11/2022. Then all of a sudden we get a new mail to say the package was lost, the POD Image changed to a new image and the delivery status also changed. So it went from delivered to hijacked from Monday to Wednesday. (The system is not efficient and lacks clear communication with the sender)And try to contact them... No pickup, Number does not exist, inbox full. Pick your excuse, but you will not reach anyone to assist you regarding your query. We do not recommend them at all and rather pay the extra cost and use a safe courier with a rating and aftersales service that you can count on for the day that unfortunate events occur and leaves your company wanting answers.We will no longer use this company as a courier and we warn you to do the research, rather than sit with unhappy clients that influence your business and you cant get answers from your courier.Date of experience: November 24, 2022RURushaan1 reviewZANov 17, 2022My order was supposed to arrived on the 16 November 2022My order was supposed to arrived on the 16th of November .

What a bunch of jokers Date of experience: March 26, 2024YEYen1 reviewAESep 24, 2024I regret to share my disappointing…I regret to share my disappointing experiences with Skynet Worldwide Courier, as their delivery service has consistently failed us over the last three shipments, both locally and internationally.Delayed Delivery: The first issue involved a document that took over a week to deliver. The reason given was that they could not contact the receiver due to the absence of a mobile number. However, we provided all the necessary information and a telephone number, and this delay was unacceptable.Customs Clearance Issues: In another instance, a shipment to Kuwait faced significant delays, taking almost a month due to clearance problems. This lack of communication and accountability added to our frustration.Incorrect Delivery: Most recently, the delivery person dropped off the package at the receiver's apartment, despite the clear instructions stating the company name and department. We provided a mobile number this time, considering previous issues, yet they still managed to deliver the package to the wrong location. This is particularly concerning given the importance of the documents involved.What’s worse is that even though they contacted the receiver, there was no effort to verify whether the delivery was personal or work-related. The delivery person should have questioned why the address differed from what was written on the airway bill. It seems they prioritize quick deliveries over accuracy, which is completely unacceptable for important files.Based on these experiences, I cannot trust Skynet Worldwide Courier with our packages again. Their lack of attention to detail and responsibility is disappointing, and I would not recommend their services to anyone needing reliable delivery.Date of experience: September 24, 2024Previous145610Next pageIs this your company?Claim your profile to access Trustpilot’s free business tools and connect with customers.Get free accountCompany activitySee allUnclaimed profileNo history of asking for reviewsPeople review on their own initiativeIs this your company?Claim your profile to access Trustpilot’s free business tools and connect with customers.Get free accountAdvertisementAbout Skynet WorldwideInformation provided by various external sourcesWe are the world’s largest independently owned express courier network, with over 1000 offices in 209 countries!

I proceeded to track the item on their website and it wasn't updating so I called thrice and was told that someone would call me back. No one did.  On November 24, I called for the 5th time and asked for a supervisor to contact me.  Turns out the package was sitting in their warehouse since November 11 because they said it was almost 1 kilo, The unbelievable thing was that NO ONE contacted me to let me know that I needed to pay a bit more to get it shipped. I had to chase them and even then I was passed around from agent to agent wine NO ONE had the correct information or update regarding my shipment. In the meantime, because of their delays and incompetence the return deadline passed and I am no longer able to send the item back to the US and get the refund.  The item was valued at 750 AED - so not only did Ilose time but money as well.  They finally returned the package to me on Nov 25 (after a sixth call!!!!!).  Terrible service - I cannot recommend them at all. If you want to ensure your packages are delivered on time - DO NOT USE Skynet!Date of experience: November 26, 2022NDNiki de Vries1 reviewZAMar 28, 2023Terribe serviceTerribe service. I am not even sure how long my package was laying by their depot. Finally I managed to find out who the company is that needs to deliver my SHEIN package. I wonder if they would have ever phoned me?? It sounds like I am just a brat that wants my clothes, BUT I actually ordered items for a unpriviledged person for a wedding.. but not sure if she will have any of it in time. They said estimated delivery time 22 March and it is 28 March already....So I finally got hold of someone Friday morning just after 8am who said they will deliver on Monday. I asked her to add my number in case they have difficulties. Monday came and go. So I phoned Monday afternoon - they said the package was out on delivery and they dont know why it wasn't delivered, but will be delivered on Tue. Tuesday came, NOTHING. When I finally got out of my meeting I tried phoning about 15 times (16:50 - 17:00) on both numbers: 021 590 3200 AND 087 1065 883. NO ANSWER. I am incredibly irretated and dissapointed. In the past Shein used ITT Couriers and I can highly recommend them. I hope the right people see my comment...... This is unexceptable. If anyone could just pick up the phone and inform me or at least  answer - IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT!!!!Date of experience: March 28, 2023Sonette Van Niekerk1 reviewZADec 8, 2023This is the worst Courier company everThis is the worst Courier company ever.

They said the delivery could not be  rescheduled until 9 days later.  It is IMPOSSIBLE to speak to someone at the distribution hub in Austin.  Only non-native English-speaking people available for customer service calls.  AWFUL customer service.Date of experience: September 03, 2022AdvertisementJeremy's Cats1 reviewGBJun 4, 2024Ordered a Fridge from NisbetsOrdered a Fridge from Nisbets. On the delivery day. XPO only sent out only 1 driver to complete the job. The driver seemed inexperienced because he could not unload the fridge from the lorry by himself. My dad was kind enough to help him unload the fridge. Shortly arriving to the shop, my dad kindly asked him to help move the fridge 5 meters into the premises. The driver refused and said it’s the company policy that they are not allowed to do that… frustrated to hear that from the driver after my dad kindly helped him do his job. He refused the delivery and told the driver to take it back. The whole ordeal was just extremely disappointing and looking at other reviews that people have made. I am not surprised after all. Date of experience: May 20, 2024Charlotte Fenwick2 reviewsGBMar 13, 2023Damaged our property, took no responsibility.Delivered two fridges to our business premises. Damaged the front door in the process. I pointed out the damage to the delivery driver immediately, who took a picture and said someone would contact me. Nobody did. I've tried calling and sending an email, but had no response. Had to repair the door at our own expense. Avoid.Date of experience: February 27, 2023SDStephen Duckett15 reviewsGBMay 16, 2024I previously worked for XPO (Wolseley)…I previously worked for XPO (Wolseley) as a HGV1 driver, Wolseley kicked Xpo out and our employment changed to Wolseley, iv left Wolseley as the Driver trainer Chris Colin’s was absolutely useless, trying to make people sign FLT training without even stepping on a truck, Telling drivers you can reverse class 1’s out onto a main road (60mph)??????? Iv applied for the Mercedes jobs and they don’t even acknowledge you, no wonder they initially had someone like Chris Colin’s working for them.

Like all the customers whom have experiences with this company before, this company cancel service without notifying you anything. It made all of us wasting time waiting for them. There's no use for your to contact them millions of calls. Nothing will be change even you try millions of calls to try to update them any information. Either the receptionists are not doing the jobs, or there's lack of communication between their receptionist with the drivers/technicians  whom come for installation or haul away service.Date of experience: December 10, 2022DEdean1 reviewUSSep 9, 2022Recently ordered refrigeratorRecently ordered refrigerator, washer, and dryer with installation package from Samsung. They arrived my place at 10:00PM and told me they can only install dryer. So, I insisted I added all installation package and paid them already. So, they installed refrigerator, washer, and dryer, BUT they missed a part for refrigerator door handle part. ALSO, while they were installing dryer, they broke a vent hose for that and told me I have to go to homedepot to purchase a vent hose for that to fix it myself. After they told me that, they literally left... So, now I have them, but can not use them. What a horrible service. I do not understand why Samsung use this unprofessional logistic company.Date of experience: September 08, 2022TBTracy Bond2 reviewsUSJun 8, 2023Order on 5/27 cancelled on date of deliveryI placed an order on 5/27.  It was scheduled for delivery on 6/8.  This was for our weekend home.  I drove 6 hours only to be here for the delivery.  I left a business and a child moving to college next week to be here.  I checked the delivery this am that was scheduled between 8 am and 8 pm.  It said it was cancelled because I refused delivery.  I called XPO and she said, I didn't refuse it it was damaged and the receiving carrier.  Now, here is the kicker...It arrived at the receiving facility on JUNE 2 (6 days) and I received no notification about the damage until I called.  There was NO communication at all.  The response I got was, \"I'm sorry for your inconvenience.\"  DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING THAT WILL BE SHIPPED FROM XPO!Date of experience: June 08, 2023AdvertisementTCTrusting Customer9 reviewsUSNov 9, 2022Do  not use XPO if you want your order!My Ikea order of August 28 never arrived in spite of the fact that I rescheduled delivery for all the following dates which was all they let me do. Nobody bothered to track or discover the problem which was, apparently, that they had misplaced the order.Sept. 7Sept. 9Sept 11Sept. 19Sept 21Sept 27Sept 29I finally gave up and Ikea sent a whole new order directly as it was clear that XPO lost it. Their \"resolution specialist\", who contacted me several times, did nothing. It was unbelievable as their phone people could only reschedule again and again - to no avail.Date of experience: October 31, 2022Stacey Jerome 16 reviewsGBAug 9, 2024Tony and Tom at Wigan are a true credit to XPOI feel that I am an exception to the reviews that I have read, however, my review is solely for Tony and Tom from the Wigan depot who have delivered to me this morning.We received a call to advise that T&T were 10 minutes away and they arrived exactly within that time frame.My house is elevated and frankly annoying for anyone to deliver to, especially 96 boxes and 3 worktops, however, not once did they complain, they offloaded into my room of choice promptly.One thing I will say is that the delivery timeframe given to the driver is nowhere near sufficient to undertake such tasks as a kitchen, worktops and accessories. Tony and Tom are a credit to XPO and I am grateful that I had excellent service from them today. Both were friendly and as aforementioned did not once complain about the umpteen boxes.

Then they did leave a message but no answer when we return call. We've been waiting on our conference table, which we were expecting per company we purchased from, on June 14th. XPO said delivery date to our office in KS would be the 21st. It seems it is still in MN today, the 21st.Date of experience: June 21, 2023MSM StJ18 reviewsGBDec 1, 2023Believe every negative reviewBelieve every negative review! All day my delivery slot kept changing. Wasted a whole day. The driver then calls me and said he's 45 minutes away and do I want to wait? Do I want to wait? I've waited the whole day! Homebase need to use a different delivery service. I will never order a large item from them again. I firmly believe that the drivers are given far too many items and therefore struggle to make delivery slots.Date of experience: December 01, 2023AdvertisementHBHoward Bentley2 reviewsUSJan 18, 2023Once again, refusing to deliver and costing me extra.Once again. XPO receives a shipment as a subcontractor and refuses delivery forcing me to drive 1.5 hours each way when I paid for door to door lift gate service. They exclude my zip code from delivery but are all too happy to receive the money. They say the drivers refuse to drive a 32 foot truck where 40’ trucks drive regularly. It’s a cop out. They should not accept shipments to addresses for which they refuse to deliver. It’s fraud. It’s lying. It’s unprofessional. Don’t be a trucking company if you cannot do the job properly. Don’t accept shipments to locations for which you refuse to deliver. This has happened now multiple times. Each tinder Costing me time and money. XPO is quite simply a bad trucking companyXPO is to be avoided at all costs. They are inept, fraudulent, and misrepresent their services. Zero integrity.Date of experience: January 17, 2023JBJerin Black3 reviewsUSOct 5, 2022This is the worst delivery company!This is the worst delivery company I've experienced!

He rang when he was getting close, I opened my side gate and he took it round into the back and placed it where I asked.  Very polite, friendly and efficient service.My only minor snag was getting through to the person that had left me a message asking me to ring to arrange a delivery date.  Rang out several times before I got through after a couple of days.Date of experience: April 08, 2024VOvee o.12 reviewsGBAug 17, 2024Rude and unhelpfulI never chose this delivery company, they delivered (just about) my Homebase order. Firstly, Ibtried to use their 'tracking' map so I could keep an eye on how far away they were so I didn't miss them, only to be faced with a blue dot on a blank screen so, very useless 'map' to track order. I was not expecting such a huge box. When they pulled it out if the van I remarked at the size if the box and they began to say something in their language which was clearly aimed at me and began laughing. You don't have to speak the same language as someone to understand body language and energy. They brought the 40kg box into my living room and i asked if they could please bring it into my conservatory. One of them just said no with a blank face. I said so if I am a lone female with no one to help me move this box, I am just stuck with this 40kg box in my living room? And the other young man said 'well basically yes'. They were rude  clearly lazy, and very unhelpful. I have had other drivers go above and beyond to help me as they knew I was not capable to move a heavy item on my own but these lot just didn't care one bit. If you have a choice, please avoid this company. Please! Worst delivery drivers ever. FURDECO were amazing!!

A company I buy from uses this company to ship me goods out of Washington State.  Shipment was suppose to get here 3 days ago.  Not today they are saying \"maybe tomorrow\".  It is sitting less than and hour from my house for 3 days now.  Unbelievable.  I have had a full crew on hand because what is on this truck needs to be used to finish orders we need to ship.  If the company I am ordering from doesn't fire XPO Logistics I will not continue to use them. They have an F rating with the better business bureau.  Shame on any company who uses them and subjects their customers to this HORRIBLE service.  Not to mention, their rates are way too high.  Overpriced and bad service.

Date of experience: April 04, 2024TMTony Maietta14 reviewsUSJan 18, 2023XPO needs to goFrom their 1-star rating, it's obvious that this is a company that has no concept of what the word service means. They have a one-star rating for a reason. Why big companies like LG and Samsung use them for their well-respected products is beyond me. I spoke to Jackie at the San Deigo hub. I have never dealt with a more aggressively rude, inconsiderate, and selfish person in my life. Here's the problem, we have a construction project going on. Due to potential supply chain issues, we ordered the appliances early. We verified with Samsung that they could delay delivery until we were ready. They confirmed a delivery date that worked for us. RXO derailed that and decided to schedule delivery for a date/time when we could not receive it. Trying to get it fixed has been a nightmare.

I advised that driver not to do that, she's risking your license. That driver has now been suspended due to driving without his card in.... Obviously the manager denied everything.

The first time they tried to deliver my load they brought it to the wrong city, then after three days of trying to reach someone to set up the delivery the told me it would be “next week sometime”. I had to have the manufacturer of the load being delivered call XPO and complain for me. So after 7 days of nothing happening XPO told me the load was coming tomorrow. So Friday comes, I get up at 6 am to make sure I’m ready for the delivery, and at 2:30 XPO calls me to say “we had someone call in so it won’t be coming until Monday”. They didn’t call me in the morning to tell me, they waited until the end of the day. This load has been sitting 50 miles from its destination for 10 days and they can figure out how to get it to me. Terrible customer service and terrible delivery practices.Date of experience: July 21, 2023MHMrs Haddouche16 reviewsGBJul 2, 2024I had a delivery today to Stockton on…I had a delivery today to Stockton on Tees.

Date of experience: July 02, 2024KBKamila Bienkowska4 reviewsGBJun 17, 2024An absolute battle to receive my full orderI ordered a garden furniture set from Homebase. On the day of the initial delivery, a delivery driver came with 3 chairs missing. He only brought a table, a parasol, and one chair. He told me the remaining chairs didn’t fit in his truck… and that he would bring them the next morning. I accepted part of the order (in hindsight, shouldn’t have done that), and in the system immediately everything was ticked as delivered. Also, no one showed up the following day and I had to contact Homebase. Then I had to wait 3 working days for xpo to reply. They rescheduled the delivery for the missing chairs (another two weeks of waiting!), but when the day came, again no one showed up. I had to contact Homebase again, and this time xpo told them that the chairs had never arrived in their warehouse/depot in the first place! So which version was true? So Homebase sent 3 new chairs (another week of waiting), and this time frankly everything was as it should be (including the expected delivery time, which the first time kept changing throughout the whole day and forced me to be stuck at home for hours, waiting). The whole experience was extremely frustrating and will keep me away from ordering from Homebase in the future and from using xpo services.

Once it got to Oregon, they said they needed another $175 for insurance because they are crossing state lines after I already paid them $110 (the package weight was 2lbs from an online pet store).  This is all done Zelle or cash app so you can't get your money back.  The item I paid for was $100 dollars and 49.99 for shipping where I purchased it.  Needless to say, I didn't give them the additional $175 and just took my loss.  I'm hoping the original sender will give me some of my money back as I am now out $260 for a $100 item I never received. I would say to avoid any company that uses their services period.

Then I'm tracking the delivery online it looks like it's almost there infact there window was up until 630 pm. I called them they had me waiting saying it was on the way up until 930. They never showed up. The next day I wake up to find out it has been rescheduled for another 2 weeks out. I called them and refused the item had I known samsung used them to ship I never would have gone that route. Considering last time something was shipped by them it showed up broken. I called samsung and bitched they offered my 100 dollars to keep the order but that doesn't help the fact I'm without a stove and eating out now.

So I rushed back home to be there in time, to find out the estimated delivery time was 5:13pm. The next thing, it’s showing that it was delivered at 9am!?Which is nonsense as I was at the property and nobody shown up to either me or my neighbours.I contacted the “customer services” team (I use that term very loosely!) and found the guy I was speaking to unbelievably obnoxious. I was told it my delivery was missing and that I would hear back from them… guess what? Nothing!I contacted HomeBase.

I call and remind them of our closing time and they say, \"can you wait another 60 minutes?,\" and I agree: one hour goes by and I call back, they tell me \"the driver is still 45 minutes away.\"Try another freight company that may be less bad.

How are you a logistics company when you can't even figure out a date to have an item delivered. A month and a half of rescheduled delivery dates with little to no communication. On the final day we are then told, item can not be delivered but the next day is about a month away. This ia not how you run a logistics company. XPO is a sorry excuse for a logistics company. Time to pack it in. Trying to cancel my order so I never have to deal with these clowns again. Did I mention, I offered to pick it up myself but they don't allow it.

First they delivered the wrong item. (a Desk) Then took two weeks to get the desk, Then were supposed to deliver the item on the 14th of October, The 18th of October, and now the 28th of October.  I have no idea what happened to the first love seat, I had to order a second one and now I am being charged for the first one that I never got. I know that I'm probably going to take months to get this straightened out and hopefully get my money back for the first love seat that was not delivered. My advice is not to use this company.Date of experience: September 16, 2022Tami Phelps2 reviewsUSApr 8, 2023XPO was to deliver a large HVAC unitXPO was to deliver a large HVAC unit, with thermostat in separate box that supplier said was on top. Delivery was delayed due to weather.  Our vacation was postponed two days because we needed to be present to receive it. It still didn’t arrive, so when we spoke to the company to get an ETA, they said it would still be a couple days, and when we asked if they could hold it until our return, they said it would cost $100/day.  We left town, and it arrived the next day, without the promised phone call prior to delivery.  The box with the thermostat was not there. We had to have a neighbor receive it.  SECOND issue:  the HVAC was defective so XPO was sent to pick it up.  Again- NO phone call ahead of time.  Neighbor was fortunately home to handle as we were at work.  No paperwork or return order # was issued.  HVAC vendor had difficulty location our return as a result, and refund was delayed.  The thermostat never came, so I imagine someone is enjoying a new $250 smart thermostat somewhere.Date of experience: March 06, 2023FOFriend of Ted 3 reviewsUSJan 3, 2023Cancelled my deliveryAwful. I called to ask if they could simply order earlier in my already scheduled delivery window or later in the day due to an appt. I even specifically said another day didn’t work for me and I’d figure out a way to have someone be there if not but NEVER asked to be cancelled. Since I didn’t have someone else to be there I cancelled my appt that would have kept me from being present for delivery only to find out they cancelled my order. I only got any email indicating it had been cancelled today after speaking with them. Because they said “well the notes say you wanted to reschedule” they refuse to do anything to correct this. I didn’t write those notes and said to listen to the call!  I probably will have to just cancel my item completely since they can’t do their job correctly.

The crew not only came in hours later without call but also damaged the refrigerator and my hardwood flooring.  The delivery crew used a hammer drill to turn the wheels but they didn't check the end result carefully.  They actually lifted the wheel and turned the wheel on its edge so that all the weight of refrigerator was sitting on tip top of the wheel edge, thus it cut into my beautiful hardwood flooring like knife to butter.  Then they pushed the refrigerator and left tracks of impression on my floor.  My 20K hardwood flooring is completely ruined.  I set up a claim with Costco and Costco passed the claim to XPO Logistics.  I had to deal with XPO Logistics Claim team for about 3 months, it has been just hurting and frustrating experience.  They kept promising they would update me soon but every time it has become a lie.   Their subcontractor directly lied about the damage.  There is no hope with this company.

Tracking showed that the delivery was scheduled to arrive at midnight that night. Slightly annoying as this is being delivered to a business but nonetheless decided to stay until 6am the following morning - no delivery.Decided to go home and then received a text at 7:50am saying my order is out for delivery. So decided to check the tracking and it was showing it was due to be delivered at 8:47am. Made my way to the business to accept the delivery - 2 hours later, still no sign of it and after reading the other reviews from GB customers, I don't imagine I'll be receiving the delivery anytime soon.Impossible to get hold of a human, only 1 contact number for the entire UK and it's completely automated and regardless of the options, just ask you to leave a message regardless.Avoid XPO and Avoid Next Day Catering.
