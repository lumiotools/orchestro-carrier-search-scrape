To top it off you can't even speak to any customer service on the phone, just an automated bot that hangs up. Unbelievably bad company, no idea why they still operate. Date of experience: November 12, 2024AdvertisementRORoon24 reviewsGB1 days agoAvoid this companyComplete and utterly useless company.  Been waiting delivery for an item that’s been at the depot since 4th November.  It’s been out for delivery but not delivered, back to depot, back on van etc etc.  scheduled again for 7th then 8th then 11th.  Still at depot.  Totally useless.  Have previously left items on pavement including expensive trolley jack.  Do not use and avoid companies that do use them.Date of experience: November 11, 2024DSDenise Smith15 reviewsGB16 hours agoOur driver lies and liesOur driver lies and lies.  His lies have been proven by not just us yet they keep him on the round.  He takes pictures of our house and posts them on different days to say he tried delivering.  He dumps parcels by the road rather than bring them to the house.   He’s obnoxious, aggressive and highly unprofessional.

Their drivers can't be bothered to deliver so mark it as \"Unable to access address\" which is a lie of course. I even left the door open and checked CCTV. No attempt made.Recently had them chasing a parcel which they delivered to a wrong address and didn't even bother scanning it. Utter shambles. No point talking to their \"Customer Service\" team as their customer service is dog shite too. Avoid like the plague.Date of experience: November 12, 2024SSShane SG7 reviewsGB8 hours agoTerrible companyTerrible company. I ordered an item and received notification DHL were going to deliver it.  I then recieved notification that it had been delivered. It most certainly had not, well at least to myself.   I checked tracking and the delivery map was pointing to another property. I contacted customer service who smartly sent a picture of a front door stating, does this look familiar. So i took a picture of my front door and stated, no because this is my front door.It seems the idiots deliver to any property that has the same house number without even following the rest of the address. I have since been ignored by DHL and have raised a claim with the company who sent the items.

When I eventually got through I was told it was the wrong part of DHL again. They tried to transfer me and I got cut off on two separate occasions.

Shame on DHL!I bought a cabinet from COSTWAY store on Amazon uk. A sms received at 14:33 saying the cargo is expected to deliver 15:00 to 16:00 on 5Nov. At 14:35, I updated the tracking system and changed the delivery date to 6Nov. But this stupid company still delivered the item at 18:43 on 5Nov. They left my heavy item, weighted 3x kg to my neighbour. They said that nothing they can offer and asked me to bring the heavy item back to my house which involves some steps up and down. What’s the point to allow recipient to change delivery date if you can’t able to offer such service! A terrible and disgusting shipping company! AVOID any retailers using DHL as their shipping partner, especially if you need to order furniture/ heavy items.Date of experience: November 05, 2024Ray Carpenter45 reviewsGB5 days agoUntrue statement about deliveryThey said that I'd personally accepted a parcel when tracking showed it was delivered on the other side of my town. Their contract is with my retailer and so I've wasted loads of time trying to track down my item.

This is despite having my full address and post code. Again had the cheek to say I wasn't at home. 2 days I sat in waiting for these idiots.

Someone had been in all day waiting for this parcel due to the urgency of it and they never bothered to show up with it.

Unfortunately Leonel, who was assigned to me was not very helpful. I understand if he has limited resources but he messages without any empathy and was pretty rude. I would hope that DHL picks people that actually want to help and have not felt that with Leonel. He ended the conversation with „I’m glad I could help you“ rather than asking if he was able to help me, when he did not do anything at all but telling me that there is nothing he can do. When I said that he was not helpful he ended the chat. I highly recommend they train the customer support staff a little more. Compassion and empathy goes a long way.

My shipper sent my product through DHL, and it arrived at DHL Montego Bay, Jamaica. The scheduled delivery date was November 4th. When I checked the tracking, I saw it had been on hold in Montego Bay since November 1st. I’ve called DHL more than 10 times, and every representative directed me to contact a specific number in Jamaica. However, the number doesn’t work, and even a local contact confirmed this. I asked several DHL reps to call the number themselves, but they said they couldn’t help and advised me to keep tracking the package—despite it being on hold since November 1st and an email from DHL instructing me to contact customer service. The last rep I spoke to even said he would end the call and that neither a supervisor nor a manager could assist me further. At this point, I have no idea where my package is or how to get help. My experience with DHL has been incredibly frustrating, and I would rate them a zero.Date of experience: November 07, 2024SCScot6 reviewsUS6 days agoTerrible experienceTerrible experience.

To their credit, they always notified me promptly, of the arrival of my package and that I should journey to their office to pick-up a detention slip for clearance at the airport. This message has been relentless, even though I've ALWAYS prepaid customs duties and taxes at the time of purchase. It appears that no one at the office bothers to check if clearance and delivery is their duty to execute or the customer's. After reminding them that they should deliver it's going to be at least 2 to 3 weeks before said package can be delivered. After complaining to your supplier that package is yet to be delivered they respond later that DHL says your package is held by customs and is therefore out of their hands until they are given the green light to proceed with clearance. Antigua is a very small country, 108 sq. miles. On no occasion have I ever gone to the airport to clear a package(s) and it took more than a few minutes. If it were different others, too, would complain. Is it that DHL, Antigua, would rather not hire a driver to do the pickup and delivery? And, to boot, I always must remind them, daily after that to deliver your package. I've got another package on the way. I'll update as to the passage of this one, be it positive or negative. But, believe me, my stomach has already begun to churn.Date of experience: February 07, 2024ALArvin Lin5 reviewsUSNov 5, 2024Something always go wrongEvery time I get something from DHL there's always some issue that entails. This time they straight up delivered to some random place and didn't follow the address. Boy, a delivery service that cannot read address. And the customer service is absolute worse. They told me there's nothing they can do, but I can file a dispute. Do they not track where their delivery guy go? We just need to know where that guy drop off the package, and I can go pick it up.Date of experience: November 04, 2024Nigel  Cannard 33 reviewsGB7 days agoWhy do you have to lie about the…Why do you have to lie about the attempt to deliver my package.Sorry couldn't gain access to your home.Picture put up by DHL , it's not even our street or estate.Why do we pay good money for such a poor service.All he had to do was pres 46 I let him in electric door, he walks 10 feet to the lift Press 3rd floor.Alleluia he's arrived.It's not rocket science is it.Stop the lies and false pictures.Feed up with being told lies.DHL don't even bother replying to this you service is absolutely shocking.Date of experience: November 06, 2024Shania Rebelo1 reviewGBA day agoHad a very bad experience. Please don't use DHL . Not reliableHad a very bad experience. Please never try to deliver using DHL services. It's better to not send the parcel then to send it through them. With a good intention to deliver family members with gift, had to use the services without no clue of not knowing what I might have to go through.  Initially they didn't share correct details and guidance to ship the parcel. Started calling up and tons of emails asking personal details in depth about the sender's travel rather then focusing on what they were looking for that is the invoice. Started up bringing issues like details , pricing of the contents of the parcel which wasn't informed before it was shipped. Charged the receiver twice the price of what was sent / shipped - for instance the items costed 160 pounds but had to pay 139 for shipment plus to relieve the parcel under customs charges given by the customs were 169 pounds!. Would give silly excuses and even opened it up in spite of the details that were asked and were being provided regarding the parcel which had only clothing and shoes. They examined the parcel which I know they can but on what basis , I'm not sure. When asked regarding the detailed information regarding extra charges , they weren't unable to answer regarding the same and started focusing on us being rude which is normal for a person to feel when they are not the ones who has to go through this whole shit and losing hard earned money which doesn't come easy. Stated on call that it has to be paid or else they informed that they can't take the delivery process forward and might further have to it destroyed. Even after paying on time inorder to get it delivered, they kept it on hold again and expect us to be patient . For what? I really don't know. This is extremely bad service provided. Hope they learn a good lesson in their life ( karma exists) if they are filled with negativity in their rotten brains.

Got a few emails within 2 days giving different delivery date. Suddenly this morning got an email saying \"your shipment was delivered\", received by (name) of someone nobody knows who she is. Shipment was on company address and here is receptionist all day at reception. I checked out with company at ground floor and 2nd floor but nobody saw courier today. Fedex, where is my parcel? Customer service agent wasn't interested to resolve this issue. Instead he gave me a premium rate phone number that charges higher rates than standard call. Shocking customer service.I'd give 0 star if I could. ! star is absolutely too much in this case. Ps: Trustpilot !!! - when will we be able to give 0 star?! It's time to introduce 0 star rate.

It took about 5 days to reach Mauritius, which is reasonable. From there, I received a call asking me to pay additional fees, which I agreed to and transferred the money to their bank account. It has now been 5 days since the package arrived in Mauritius (10 days in total since it was sent). I have contacted the office in Mauritius several times via WhatsApp to ask when I would receive the parcel, but they haven’t responded. I’ve also called multiple times, and each time they said another representative would get back to me, but I’m still left waiting. This experience has been very disappointing, and I would not recommend this company to anyone.Date of experience: November 13, 2024Melanie Nunya3 reviewsUS2 days agoHow to speak to a LIVE PERSON…It's impossible to get to a LIVE PERSON at Fedex, but I finally found a way to get thru the AI crap... use the prompts until you get to OPTION 3, which is to \"return a call from Fedex\" and then you should be able to speak to a real person. I did not have a tracking number since the shipper closed my case after FedEx delivered my packages to the WRONG ADDRESS and refused to retrieve my packages and deliver them to my correct address. I don't have tracking numbers since I don't have the packages! The automated system at Fedex will hang up on you if you don't have the tracking numbers.

Then, the package arrived in the city on Saturday night, but it didnt get delivered Sunday. The delivery status said it was on a truck, but the truck didnt move all day and then it disappeared. Maybe tomorrow.At the same time, Fedex web site was down most of the day - specially signin was hanging. Mobile version also was behaving weird.

The last several packages I have received that were sent Fedex were delayed day after day after day, usually with no reason given or an invalid reason (customer not available or business closed, bad address, anything they want to say that is not true). I have called Fedex customer support several times, and although a couple of the agents attempted to help me and were friendly, they are truly clueless and usually just try to gloss over any wrongdoing on Fedex's part.

Christina the delivery person in Evergreen CO continues to leave our packages down on the street, 300 feet from the front door.  We removed the mailboxes weeks ago since postal lockers for the neighborhood were installed down the street.  She has decided that leaving our expensive packages behind the posts where the mailboxes used to be is the same as our front porch. She even lies and says in her report that the side of the street, where anything could be easily stolen or ruined by mud, rain and snow is leaving it on our front porch.  This is rediculous.  She knows this is completely unacceptable yet has done it at least 4 times now.  Amazon and UPS understand the difference between front porch and filthy ditch on the street.  Please, Fed Ex Management,  explain this to her before our next delivery, we have called several times and she still hasn't gotten the message.

The delivery person was at my door but I was not home and called me to pay my invoice. The online pay now was completely unfunctional so my item has to be delivered tomorrow now. The delivery person had a terrible accent I tried my best to understand whatever he was saying. When I asked what my invoice date he couldn’t tell me for reasons I don’t even know why so I couldn’t pay from the other portal either. Quite upset since I did not receive the invoice and because the website is defective I have to wait till tomorrow which I might not be home again or for the weekend.

Got a parcel sent over which supposed to arrive by Monday 28th October (confirmed by text with a tracking link to it). It's 6th of November already, no updates on the tracking, people who sent the parcel tried to contact them to find out what is going on and the questions they've received back were about the colours of the items inside etc. First, what does that have to do with the delay of the delivery? Second, why do they need this information? Third, let's be honest, the parcel wasn't small, it didn't get lost, but it got stolen, it'a clear! Useless, horrible and pathetic company!

When he brought it down he was carrying a 3ft length,just under 3ft width and 3/4 of a foot height ,he deliberately hid that he dropped it! The parcel wasn't even to be moved apart from carrying it level across. He quickly gave me it then turned quick to get away ,I had to shout \" don't you want a signature ? NO .

Instead of knocking so I could sign the slip to receive my working phone, FedEx -  managed not to alert my 4 dogs when they placed the notice on my door and left.  My head was a foot away from the door.  They refused to knock. This is keeping me without a reliable phone.  This is BS.Date of experience: November 09, 2024HSHoda Sadeghi2 reviewsUS4 days ago\"I am extremely disappointed with…\"I am extremely disappointed with FedEx. After four weeks of waiting and calling customer service daily—sometimes spending an hour on the phone—no one could tell me where my package was. The lack of accountability and communication has been frustrating beyond words. I wouldn’t recommend FedEx to anyone; they wasted my time and money. Very poor service!\"Date of experience: November 08, 2024Lisa Karczynski3 reviewsUS2 days agoFedEx's horrible delivery experience.FedEx really messed up here, when I ordered a bed frame from Bed Bath and Beyond, I put the address to my apartment, FedEx was supposed to deliver it to my apartment door, not the Management and Leasing Office. The problem is that this was a 52 lb package, which I cannot carry and drag down numerous amount of stairs, a package like that is too heavy for me and I am disabled. I am lucky that the staff to my apartment complex are so nice to help me, because FedEx didn't do anything to help. They just told me, \"we'll just mark it down that we will make sure that this won't happen again and we're sorry for the inconvenience.\" That was a horrible experience that day and I dread if any package I order if it's a large package gets this carrier. UPS does their job to actually follow instructions and delivers to the address that is listed, even if it is a huge apartment complex, so why not FedEx? It's because they hire lazy delivery drivers that don't care what happens to people's packages or if a person can easily retrieve their package if it's larger than a small or medium package. Definitely the worst delivery carrier.Date of experience: October 06, 2024Read 1 more review about FedExAdvertisementESEvan Scott2 reviewsUS6 days agoOnce again FedEx doesn’t fail to…Once again FedEx doesn’t fail to disappoint.

It is now gotten to the point that if a seller or distributor only uses FedEx I will not take their product I'd rather pay a higher price somewhere else than to deal with the bad shipping service this shipper delivers once again I'm being inconvenient by not getting an item on time I would never recommend this shipper. As usual FedEx is letting me down. I am (insert vulgar street term for baby making act that starts with F) irate. This is the like fifth time this year, several times last year.

Will he could have delivered the package to my apartment door and leaving there since I didn’t need a signature. The call center representative was giving me lame excuses as to why the delivery person couldn’t leave the package at my door. Now I have to deal with another driver, more headaches and maybe have my package sent back to Walmart. All because I don’t have a car or time to head out to your aldergrove location to get my package all because I work.

I made appropriate arrangement for someone to be home then.  Then they decided to deliver before 8pm.  I can't be home all day.

I contacted Louisville CO fedex to let them know immediately that it was delivered to the wrong person and obviously was not signed by anyone in our household because the name did not match the package.They said they would look into it. Fedex never fixed the problem or contacted me back after the first day when I said \"just check the GPS.\"Apparently you can just steal people's packages and continue to have your job at this location with zero consequences.Do better FedEx.

Date of experience: November 06, 2024AdvertisementKDKristof De Rore10 reviewsBE4 days agoThe worst delivery company in the worldSo we sent boxes from italy to Belgium with olive oil. Fedex promises to deliver within 72 hours. What is a big lie. Most of the boxes were delivered after 96 hours. So remove the slogan from your website. Fake promises. Our clients contacted us when they received our boxes. A lot of broken bottles, destroyed cans and on top of that they repacked our boxes in their shitty boxes. Because the oil was dripping out. And we packed our bottles very professionnel with bubble plastic, thick carton etc. They removed everything and they just placed our bottles and can flat on each other without protection. And no fragile stickers or nothing on it. While we packed everything with fragile stickers. But seems like the people of fedex are too stupid to know what fragile means. So fedex doesn't know what respect is and too stupid to know that they have to handle that with care. But the claim will follow, and refund you will fedex. A real shame to you, uneducated people. Hopefully nobody will use fedex anymore. We even have a couple of boxes that are lost.

I’m not trying to be a Karen but they were delivering the birthday present and they literally had a week to do it. But the delivery people were literally soo dumb that they didn’t even try calling my apartment for two days to attempt delivery. Instead, they just marked it as ‘nobody was home, unable to deliver.’ Like seriously??? I work from fn home! After calling customer support numerous times, some brainless representative named John told me my package was at the pickup center but surprise, surprise, it wasn’t there! Nobody knows where it is; it’s just driving around town while these delivery idiots get paid for doing absolutely nothing. What a great experience!

Well, it is nearly 4 hours past the end of day and my package still has yet to arrive, and the tracking page now says the delivery date is not available, yet will arrive on time. I tried to use the chat to contact FedEx to find out the status of my package. It wouldn’t give me any information, except to call a number for more information, which was supplied. Called several times all i got was virtual assistance, at the 14th call managed to talk to someone the person open a case  only to send me another email minutes later saying that my case was closed and i have not received the package.Date of experience: November 06, 2024Dix Lew1 reviewUS6 days agoNever Never Ever Again!Never, never, ever use FedEx!

AI AGAIN. I tried 1st # again... Get people actually, but in India... So I can't understand some of what they say!

I made a purchase with a company that uses FedEx for a delivery service.  I had 4 packages in my shipment that were shipped together.  The main package was MISLOADED by FedEx and wasn't delivered with the other 3 today.  I wasted a whole day on this delivery only to find out that due to \"INCOMPETENCE\" and whatever, the main package won't be delivered until maybe 11/9/2024.  My time is just as important as the imbeciles that made the mistake, but I pay the price for it because of having to waste another day waiting on package before I might be able to assemble.  FEDEX IS THE WORSE DELIVERY IN THE COUNTRY.  Something else that should be noted, if FedEx was a reputable company, they would at least read and respond to the issues that have been noted.  This really shows what FedEx values, and it sure isn't the customer.Date of experience: November 08, 2024RARay1 reviewUSNov 4, 2024Paid for Priority OvernightPaid for Priority Overnight, had the correct address, and still, they failed to deliver it.

I have managed to finally track my parcel. The place where it was delivered to had returned it to Amazon Shipping with my correct post code amended  on it. Amazon then redelivered it straight back to them have scrubbed out their amendment and putting the original WRONG postcode back on it, so they sent it back to Amazon again, did a bit of detective work,found my details online and emailed to tell me they had sent the package back to Amazon again.  Zara dont want to know. I have spent nearly 3/4 hour on a Chat with Amazon trying to get them to put me in contact with my local depot. That request was ignored several times and I was told to contact ZARA who just hang up on me. It really isn't impossible to contact the local depot, locate the parcel (you'd hope there isn't a mountain of long forgotten parcels to sift through) and redirect it to me. The really frustrating part of this fiasco is that the day the parcel went missing Amazon had delivered two other parcels to me at 6:30pm before swanning off and dumping my parcel ten miles away underneath the signpost for another village - not my village, not my road or even the same name as my road, and definitely not the same door number.

They showed up and one of them immediately decided that the dresser was too heavy for him and cancelled the job on the spot. I wound up being forced to move the dresser with a buddy, which wasn't fun for me, but doable. To add insult to injury, Dolly is keeping my money after cancelling the job and doing nothing. This is a racket.

At pickup, I paid for two helpers but only one showed up and scratched the first location's floors. The second helper finally showed up at the second location. When putting the couch in the desired area, they went through a tight area and destroyed the kitchen, including broken tiles, broken light switch cover, floor scratches, dented the refrigerator and scraped paint off the walls. Horrible experience and wouldn't recommend anyone using this company.Date of experience: August 13, 2024An Gus1 reviewUSMay 13, 2024They charge you for each small items in…They charge you for each small items in a bag instead of the bag. Once you select what you want to have delivered the helpers will change it up so it is the most expensive way to deliver possible. What started out as a $65 delivery fee turned into a $300 fee. Because instead of the the 3 grocery bags being charged they charged me per item inside the grocery bags.Also you won’t be able to reach customer support in any reasonable time and when they finally call you back you will hardly be able to understand the Indian person they outsourced their call center too.

False and misleading protection on your property if they cause the damage. Poor communication as well. On May 13, 2024, Dolly delivered flooring to my house. The delivery driver hit my mailbox and damaged it. I submitted a claim per their process for damages, but they have stopped communicating, and have instead demanded I claim this with my homeowner's insurance. They have refused to repair something that they caused damage to, and now are not communicating with me. They claim on their website that they will cover damages. This is false and misleading.

The workers did a good job moving but they had no people skills and kept saying \"time is money\" when I was placing items in my own car that I didn't want in their truck that might be broken. I might use them again in a pinch but they don't have a customer service number to call which makes me hesitant.Date of experience: February 24, 2024Previous1234Next pageCompany activitySee allClaimed profileHasn’t replied to negative reviewsAbout DollyInformation provided by various external sourcesLoad, haul, and delivery just about anything.

Bought a store display fridge under the agreement it would be taken away the next day. Booked Dolly.com, abd got a call last minute telling me that the normal sized fridge was over the weight limit and they were canceling my order free of charge, like that was something I was supppsed to be grateful for.Date of experience: September 21, 2023KSKristi Stoll8 reviewsUSAug 8, 2024DO NOT HIRE THEMBooked this service online on a Monday for Tuesday morning. They confirmed within an hour. The next day, they called, at the time they were supposed to be picking up, and moved it to that afternoon. Then the next afternoon. Then that early evening. Then Thursday morning. I called to see what was going on...they have NO helpers to move our stuff yet they keep promising that it is going to be delivered. I told the woman today, you need to be honest to tell your customer that you have no one instead of promising a new time as if it is scheduled. Their customer service is in India or Pakistan. DO NOT HIRE THEM. DO NOT COUNT ON THEM. THEY ARE UNRELIABLE!Date of experience: August 07, 2024MPM P1 reviewUSMay 20, 2024100% Scam artistsScam artists. They do not pick up the phone (I've been calling for three days, during business hours). I used their website dolly.com to book a pickup, and my order was immediately cancelled (not by me) and they charged my card anyway. I'll have to dispute this with my credit card company now. I'm shocked Big Lots would have a contract with Dolly, or would suggest to use them at all. I believe it is a 100% scam, and not even 0% legitimate. They should be investigated by the authorities and Big Lots should be fined as well.Date of experience: May 20, 2024William Vandelft1 reviewUSApr 10, 2023SCAM COMPANYVery poor customer service.  They send you a picture of who's supposed to be delivering, but two other people showed up. They delivered a washer/dryer stack unit to my house and dropped it out of the back of a pickup truck, breaking front glass and damaging case. Not so much as \"I'm sorry\" just left appliance in driveway, in the rain and left.  Entire customer service platform is 100% automated. No live people to talk too. Very poor service, DO NOT USE.Date of experience: April 04, 2023Tim Bracco1 reviewUSFeb 18, 2024Terrible company that deserves 0/5…Terrible company that deserves 0/5 stars. Had my appointed time slot confirmed, talked to the two helpers that were supposed to move my stuff and got everything confirmed. Woke up the day that I HAD to move and they said the helpers were put on a different job (???) and theyd need to reschedule when they could find new helpers. Gave me no option to do anything at this point and wasted my entire day, completely screwing me over. Do not waste any time with this joke of a companyDate of experience: February 17, 2024Christina Carlson1 reviewUSOct 3, 2024Unreliable. Unprofessional. Dolly canceled 8mins before the job. I THOUGHT Dolly.com was my hero. I've spent the past week straight packing and loading up my entire life into a 15' truck and moving from the Bay Area to LA, with help from friends here n there. But the bulk of it I've done alone. Needless to say, I'm exhausted. So by the time I arrived in LA I decided you know what, I'm going to hire movers to help me do the unloading so that I could focus on cleaning and preparing, as I had to be at work the next morning. So I looked online for same day moving help, and dolly.com was one of the first ones that came up.It was between 2:30-3pm on Tuesday, I booked and paid up front for two workers for 2 hours, to arrive at 6pm. I still had a lot to do, so I spent next 3 hours looking for refrigerator, taking care of some work on my laptop, and I even went to the store to buy some waters for the workers & to Harbor Freight to purchase a dolly to help them with the unloading. On my way back home, I received a call from Dolly at 5:52 pm saying that they did not have team members to assist with my job, and informed me that they would be able to find me some team members tomorrow. I could not believe what I was hearing. I informed the representative that tomorrow was not possible, as the truck needed to be returned tonight, and that I would be returning to work tomorrow. I was devastated. I told her that they should have informed me much earlier in the day, as I have now wasted 3 hours of daylight that I could have used to unload the truck that needed to be returned that same evening. Although she did seem sympathetic, and did say that I would receive a full refund, which now being Thursday, the charge is still pending.I hope that I don't have issues with the refund.Dolly is UNRELIABLE  and UNPROFESSIONAL. Granted I only booked 3 hrs in advance, but they advertise  \"on-demand/same day\" service in Google search, which is misleading. There is NO excuse for them to have waited nearly 3hrs, only 8mins before the job began to inform me that there would be no job. Date of experience: October 01, 2024Aaron Robbs1 reviewUSSep 20, 2023Avoid at all costsAvoid at all costs. We hired Dolly to move a $1300 dresser we purchased preowned. The Dolly workers completely destroyed the dresser before getting it into the sellers elevator. We only found out that the dresser was destroyed bc the seller was in contact with us. We messaged the driver and he assured us Dolly would be in contact and would reimburse us. After radio silence from the Dolly CS, they finally emailed asking how old the dresser was. More than a week later they're only offering us $390 and they still charged us a fee for using their service. I feel like we flushed $700 down the toilet. Worst customer service I've ever experienced.Date of experience: September 10, 2023Randel L. Rogers1 reviewUSOct 26, 2023No Call, No Show, HIGH RISK - DO NOT USEI booked to helpers to move a washer and dryer and received a confirmation from the lead helper.  The morning they were due they were a no call, no show.  The helper did not respond to texts, his phone went to a full voicemail box, and there is no customer assistance or scheduler to call or even chat with from the website or app.  An hour past their window I looked at reschedule for another day with another helper, but received no response on the app, so cancelled.  Upon reading some reviews, I now question if their helpers are individually bonded or insured - it appears the company is insured, but in spite of their claims it does not appear there is any protection for your property.  DO NOT USE  - HIGH RISK.Date of experience: October 26, 2023JSJanette Schreider2 reviewsUSAug 19, 2024Dolly movers refused to move item - still had to pay for itI booked a move of a dining room set - table, chairs and china hutch.  The movers showed up and they said the hutch was too heavy for them to move and they refused to move it.  Dolly sent me information stating that they would not move anything over 300 pounds.  The hutch is 2 pieces, base and cabinet, that are only about 150 pounds or less each.  So the item was NOT over 300 pounds since it was in two pieces.The movers did not have blankets, shrink wrap or even a dolly to use to assist them!Date of experience: August 17, 2024Caitlin Easter1 reviewUSApr 18, 2024They didn't show upThey didn't show up.

Date of experience: April 14, 2024Alicia King1 reviewUSMar 12, 2024Do not use this companyI booked our movers over a month in advance. The day came and they never showed up. I called customer service only to be told that they canceled. The company did nothing to help us and we were stuck without movers. This is the worst moving company. The customer service is horrible. I am not one to write bad reviews, but this was awful. Thank goodness we had friends who were willing to use their days off to help us. I would never recommend this business to anyone. Date of experience: March 10, 2024LHLaTisha Harris1 reviewUSFeb 22, 2024Negative Stars!!Negative Stars!!! Used Dolly 12/10/23 & again on 02/18/24. 1st experience was ok. On time and courteous but, movers were not prepared with any moving straps, dolly, padding, or wrapping to protect anything. Floor was scratched as they drug my fridge down my basement steps. Next time was the worse. Exact same preparation and If they could have thrown my elliptical down my stairs from the driveway I believe they would have. Again no moving essentials provided and 2 men nothing else. Did bring a little girl tho!! They broke my stair when they dropped my elliptical and I put in a claim. Movers didn’t even apologize but sure sent that tip reminder. Dolly quickly refused my claim because they are not responsible for ANY damage to walls, floors, ceilings, any structures or belongings they damage!!! The movers will not do anything to prevent the damage either. If you don’t CYA with them you’ll get AFU!!! I’ll never use them again!!Date of experience: February 18, 2024DMDave Menchen3 reviewsUSMar 10, 2024DON'T TRUST THESE GUYS OR YOU WILL REGRET IT!I contracted with Dolly based on a \"friends\" recommendation. I may drop that friend. Scheduled for 9:30 AM but showed up at 4:30 PM. OK, no big deal, wasn't in a particular hurry. Getting house ready to sell so needed to empty some rooms by moving things to my garage, so not even a hard job, you would think...They managed to punch a 5 inch hole in the wall that I had just paid to have painted, 36 hours before my open house! Sent them all the data including photos with my damage claim. Had to scramble to get my painter back to fix the drywall, prime and paint.THEN DOLLY TELLS ME THAT DAMAGE TO MY HOUSE IS NOT COVERED UNDER THE\"DAMAGE PROTECTION INCLUDED\" PART OF THE CONTRACT! If my house was on fire I wouldn't let them carry anything out, what a HORRIBLE COMPANY!!!Date of experience: March 06, 2024CCClaudine Collins1 reviewUSSep 24, 2023Great experience …The gentleman I received communicated well with me prior to his pick up and delivery of my coffee table.

I tipped him well for his job well done.Date of experience: September 20, 2023Jen McCarty1 reviewUSApr 8, 2024Movers lied. Order cancelled. I got charged anyway!Booked 2 guys and a truck to move one dining table. The guys showed up, said it was over 300lbs and they wouldn’t be able to take it. The table breaks into 2 pieces- they could’ve broken it down into 2 pieces under 300lb each.Now the company is charging me the full service cost!!!Let me ask- if you're a mover and you know you’re getting paid anyway without having to do anything, what incentive do you have to do any work?? They’re just going to keep lying!Don’t use this service!!!This is fraud!!!! Date of experience: April 08, 2024RSRobin Sayers2 reviewsUSMar 7, 2024AVOID AVOID AVOIDMy pickup had a window of 2–2:30 PM. I bought something off Facebook Marketplace, and the seller was waiting at his mini storage facility. My Dolly mover cancelled at 2:35 PM and Dolly just messaged me \"Your Dolly Helper has notified us that they're unable to do your Dolly. Our apologies! We're working hard to find a new Helper.\" But this is New York City. My building, like many, have extremely strict insurance (COI) requirements that need to be approved for any furniture item move-in, and a jam-packed freight elevator schedule. (Arranging these things is a pain but these rules help make it such a nice building.) Also, I scheduled a Thumbtack pro to assemble the piece of furniture the following day at 2:30 PM, and I had to cancel 24 hours in advance not to incur a cancellation fee. Because the driver texted me that he was on his way, I thought everything was fine. Now I need to pay $50 to Thumbtack (which is only fair, not faulting them), find a new mover with enough insurance for my building, get the COI approved, and work my way onto the freight elevator schedule. So I'd describe Dolly in one word: NIGHTMARE. Date of experience: March 07, 2024Ash Saturday1 reviewUSSep 12, 2023WORST COMPANY EVERDo not use them. Some of my very sentimentally valuable property was left behind and they did NOTHING to help put be back in contact with my helper. Do not use them. I have lost something that is virtually irreplaceable.Date of experience: August 23, 2023Jenny King3 reviewsUSMay 4, 2024Buyer beware—uses uninsured workersBuyer beware: If you use Dolly to hire “time-based” helpers to move items in your house, your house is NOT covered if those helpers damage your items/house. I used Dolly to hire two ppl to move a filing cabinet that they dropped into my wall. Upon contacting Dolly, I was shocked to find out their helpers are not insured and I would be stuck not only with the cost of the original Dolly (minus a $150 credit for the inconvenience), PLUS, all the damages to my wall, PLUS the cost to move the cabinet again. Dolly’s response was that it’s not their fault and they don’t cover “time-based” moves, as noted in their terms of service. But that fine print was never presented to me during the time of booking, and I’d also not consistent with their policy on other parts of their website. Their customer service was rude and insulting, and eventually, I took it up with my CC company who said it sounded shady AF!! (Ok, I added the swearing 🤪)Net-net? Do NOT use Dolly. I followed up with another service, Task Rabbit, and found insured helpers for half the cost. Ugh!!#dollydamageDate of experience: May 01, 2024KMKathe Milstein4 reviewsUSMar 4, 2024Read the reviewsRead the reviews!  Do not buy anything from anywhere that uses Dolly to deliver!  I wished that I was smart enough to read the reviews first.  Bought stuff from the Container Store and had to wait 10 days for it to be delivered.  Was supposed to be a 10:00 pickup from the store & delivery to my house by 11.  It's after 12 and no text, no phone call, no nothing to get an update.  Just so angry at the inconvenience and lack of courtesy!Date of experience: March 03, 2024JKJohnny Kash1 reviewUSFeb 14, 2024ScamScam. Driver wanted cash for \"his company.\" He wanted to get paid outside of the app.I wasn't ok with that. He opened the app to add items, but would not subtract items that I was taking. I decided to take the valuables because he was untrustworthy. The app did not refresh. Either a bug or the mover manually turned off his mobile internet.

I had a delivery scheduled for 3/9 @ a retail store,the pick up time was between 10am-10:30am, the store opens at 9:30 am. Why was the driver there @ 8:45 am?? In addition to that upon speaking to him on the phone I asked him where his helper was? he stated that the helper was supposed to meet him at the store, which I found out that was a LIE. I paid for 1 driver and 1 helper, I received a 2 in 1, driver and helper combined. Why would they send one person to manage to HEAVY ASS cocktail table. When the driver arrived at my home he struggled with the table after knocking down a piece of existing furniture in my home. I was informed by Dolly that I would receive a refund for not having proper help. Within an hour of my delivery I received an email stating we regret to inform you that we can not issue a credit @this time. DO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE THEY ARE F$#?

When I tried to call Dolly, I got hung up on 4x after I was on hold for 20 minutes each time. I had to come out an extra $300 to other movers just to get the necessary service which was awful. Never again. Why hasn't the BBB gone after them yet??Date of experience: August 26, 2023Victoria Bryant1 reviewUSUpdated Feb 17, 2024Beware! Don’t use them.Dolly puts a hold on your payment for the full amount. My furniture was supposed to be moved the same day.  It wasn’t moved until the next day and then they charged me an extra $65 because the movers truck was not big enough. the only reason that I did not go with another moving company was because I had to have that moved by Sunday or Goodwill would have returned the furniture to stock the next day and giving me a credit which I did not want. Then when  the move is completed they charge you for the full amount. Then you have to wait between one and three business days for that hold to fall off your account. On my fourth business day I contacted Dolly. This was 02/15/2024 because the hold hadn’t fallen off my account. The customer service agent said he put in a request with his supervisor so that money could be credited back to my bank account. I then received an email from the supervisor stating that they had put in a request for the money to be credited back to my account. However, it could be March 10 at the latest, I will never use them again. I would give them zero stars if I could.Date of experience: February 09, 2024Serga Belorussets1 reviewUSSep 13, 2023It's the worst service I've ever hadIt's the worst service I've ever had.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS!This is by far the WORST moving company! I didn't know anything about Dolly. They were selected as the 3rd party moving company Bob's discount furniture uses. I scheduled to have my furniture picked up and delivered Saturday (3/2/24) between 11-2 pm. They could not find any workers to do thr job. Which I didn't even know was how the job is done. I had to keep calling to check the status of my delivery and each time they kept saying, \"we don't have any workers\". I was confused because how the heck doesn't a company have workers? Bob's furniture didn't explain to me how this company operates so I was confused. We rescheduled the delivery time frame 3 times on 3/2. By 6 pm, I was over it. They rescheduled the delivery for the following day for 11-1pm. It is now almost 2pm and still I received NO UPDATES and NO FURNITURE!!! I called back to inquire about the delivery and once again they replied, \"we have no workers\". To make matters worse, I ordered the delivery on Wednesday and NOTHING has gone as planned. They are unprofessional, are unable to honor their commitments and when you call, are unable to provide you with updates or possible suggestions. The representative are CLUELESS about ways to best help their customers. I'm seconds away from getting a Uhaul and moving the furniture myself (as I live alone).I ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS COMPANY! It has inconvenienced me in so many ways waiting for my furniture to arrive. I will NEVER recommend this company to ANYONE!

Tips are essential.Date of experience: January 12, 2024RSRyan S1 reviewUSUpdated Nov 9, 2023My bar was low but holy sh…Dolly is the worst experience you’ll have moving. I will never ever move from them again, let alone purchase something from a retail store that requires them to be the delivery service. Background: I purchased a 3 piece sectional sofa that needed to be delivered 12 miles, and the store partnered with Dolly to be the delivery service.Scheduled Dolly for Tuesday 10am-2pm as my building has a strict rule of no , and take time off work during the delivery window. Multiple “helpers” message me saying they requested delivery just waiting for dolly to respond.Dolly eventually calls me and says they can’t find a helper. Wait what?? That makes no sense. I ask to be escalated to a manager or supervisor and get told “no”. Over 2 hours is spent on the phone and I get told to pretty much eat dirt.Eventually I reschedule it to Wednesday 10am-1pm, again taking more time off work. I had a flight this afternoon at 5pm (was not a concern given that Dolly was scheduled have delivered item the 24 hours before the flight)A helper finally picks my request. I feel relieved as messages me he should be available latest 1pm after his first dolly, and he is aware of my 4pm cutoff time + flight.Except, Dolly scheduled him that morning to drive over to Long Island, 2 hours away. My helper informs me that because of traffic he can’t get here until 4:30pm. I call customer service saying this won’t work out let’s please reschedule again. The rep Gregory McIntosh tells me since a helper already accepted I cannot cancel as he’s in the way and stuck in trafficOkay, well my building has a strict 4pm rule, this delivery was scheduled to be done from 10am-1pm, and you already didn’t deliver my item yesterday. I literally get told “you should have read the terms and conditions”.Again: If Dolly has your delivery coming 4 hours later than originally told (and that doesn’t work), be prepared to eat you Dolly fee despite Dolly screwing up.I end up having to wait for my helper to deliver my item at 4:30pm. Overall here is my experience with dolly:- 8 hours of PTO used for nothing- 3-4 hours on the phone with “customer support”, including being hung up on once- 1 rescheduled flight at the cost of $200- 1 couch delivered 30 hours late- 5 different times I had to reschedule my service elevator with my buildingI can’t say this company has the worst customer service because they don’t have any real customer service. I will never ever use Dolly again, and will refuse doing business with a company if they require me to use Dolly.Date of experience: November 08, 2023Previous1234Next pageCompany activitySee allClaimed profileHasn’t replied to negative reviewsAbout DollyInformation provided by various external sourcesLoad, haul, and delivery just about anything.

DoorDash over charges customers when they order and under pays the delivery drivers. Most customers don't tip because DoorDash says: free delivery. It's the dashers time, vehicle wear and tear, gasoline ect and dashers get only $2 pay from DoorDash. Getting paid per hour would be a rip off too. I only DoorDash when we need extra money. Oh and peak pay is very rare. DoorDash takes out around $70 at tax time.

It's a blessing to get delicious food or drink from your favorite restaurants. I'm always super grateful and happy when I receive anything from DoorDash. In bigger cities people probably take it for granted. In rural america, I was taught never to take food for granted and to always say thank you for  great meal. Thank you Doordash for feeding people and changing lives.Date of experience: November 11, 2024JMJorden Mitchell5 reviewsUSA day agoI placed a food order for my husband…I placed a food order for my husband who is an OTR driver and had a blown out tire. He was DIRECTLY on the other side of the highway from McDonald's where the order came from. With a lit up truck, flashers on and a lit up mechanics truck. Communicated with the driver multiple times and he literally run circles around him. Apparently he can't follow instructions and pay attention for shit. It took so long that all other food places were already closed and he never got eat. Very disappointed and I'm pissed off that he didn't get to eat. We should do better for our drivers out there on the road especially when they are in difficult situations.

Counted DoorDash with photo proof, and they gave me a whooping $3 credit. Keep in mind I just signed up for dasher pass at $90. This company is nothing but thieves. That’s $11 just on my order alone.

I ordered 2 frozen hot chocolates, 2 chicken strips baskets and a kids meal from dairy queen and it took so long to get my food it was literally cold and the frozen hot chocolates were PURE ROOM TEMPERATURE LIQUID! Door dash refused to give me my money back even after sending photos, chatting in several times etc. They are awful and should be ashamed of themselves! No wonder they did not care when I told them I would write them bad reviews everywhere I could all over the internet cuz their reputation is already awful, it cant get much worse! Ill be filing a charge back with my bank and I suggest everyone else with similar issues to do the same! And don't EVER believe them if they tell you to order first cuz your code is not working and then they will refund the coupon amount to you cuz they lie about that too!! I even took screenshots where the rep told me to go ahead and order and then they would refund me the coupon since it was not working but was valid and even seeing the screenshot with a message from THEIR rep telling me this, they STILL refuse to give me the credit for the coupon now! I don't know how they are still in business! Just use another delivery service!Date of experience: November 12, 2024AMAMY3 reviewsUS2 days agoSeems this is no the first bad review Wow.  Looking through all these reviews I see my issue is not the first. They only delivered 2/6 items, the restaurant called after they left to say the food was waiting on the counter. Called DoorDash, “nope- no way we can have another driver go back for that, we’ll give you a refund”. The refund was not enough to cover the missing items ($37/$100 order), which I didn’t even want a refund, I wanted someone to go back 2 miles to pick up the rest of our dinner so my three children under 4 could eat. We were stuck at an airport hotel and had no way to get dinner. After multiple super frustrating calls with doordash, I opened up the two items and it had fish (instead of tofu). Sigh. We will never use DoorDash again.Date of experience: November 09, 2024Donald Wade17 reviewsUSA day agoSecond back to back order with only…Second back to back order with only half our food .

Date of experience: November 05, 2024SBSarah Bibbs11 reviewsUS7 days agoDoorDash is totally unreliable Ordered a pizza on 11/4 to be delivered on 11/5 when I had a sitter. Pizza never showed, and the order never updated. When I called customer service on 11/6 (they were not available in 11/5 when needed) they asked if I still wanted to wait for the pizza. Seriously. And then they finally refunded, but without any credit for the inconvenience and screw up they caused. Terrible app and customer service. I’ve had numerous past orders get screwed up, and customer service is always slow to remedy and fully remediate. Don’t recommend, unless you enjoy repeat disappointment and frustration.Date of experience: November 05, 2024low bridge1 reviewUSA day agoRefused to properly compensate me for missing itemsI made a huge order through doordash from McDonalds. A couple of my items were missing from my delivered order. The missing items was an entire large meal plus an extra order of fries. I was charged for over 15 dollars for these missing items (im not including the costs of sales tax, delivery fees, doordash fee, and tip for the driver). I notified doordash, hoping they could re-deliver the missing items (at no additional cost to me), but they refused. Giving me only the option of doordash credits. Worse, they credited me only $6.17. Since they refused to have my (missing) food items sent to me, and since they made me accept their credits as my only option, I would think they would have to reimburse me in full. $6.17 in credits for something that cost me over 15 dollars just doesn't suffice. I appealed, and made a complaint and they bumped up my credit from $6.17 to $9.72. This still isn't a full, proper reimbursement. So, I kept on complaining to doordash, demanding they reimburse me in full. Their agents just would tell me things like they're kicking my complaint upstairs to their special team (assuming they even exist) and/or it would take 24 hours for a resolution, things like that. But I never heard back, let alone got my credits properly increased to what I'm truly owed. After getting a run around from one of their agents, I'd re-apply my complaint with a new agent. After a few times of this and not getting any resolution (well, according to them, they resolved my issue. But not properly according to me.), I finally threw in the towel. They just dug in their heels and refused to properly compensate me without openly saying so. I'm sure multi-billion dollar door dash (10 billion annual revenue. market cap: 71 billion) needs the 6 extra dollars they still owe me more than I do. Lousy crooks.Date of experience: October 26, 2024KRKristiny1 reviewAU4 days agoThis is the worst app I’ve ever used to…This is the worst app I’ve ever used to order food.

I understand things happen, and I reached out to customer service online which promptly said they couldnt help me and disconnected.

I contacted the driver who did not speak English, but managed to explain that he had not yet picked up my order from Outback.  I told him that I believed the order was canceled.  He tried to reach DD, but no one answered his calls.  To be on the safe side, I put a cancellation on the order.  I ordered hamburgers from Chili’s, and after we finished eating them, the driver showed up with the cold steaks.  We did not accept the meal.  I chatted with 3 different DD representatives, who refused to grant a refund.  Also, DD erased the communication screen showing their multiple cancellation notices, then it claimed I lacked evidence showing the notices were sent.  Buyer Beware.

Date of experience: November 01, 2024Eric Johnson4 reviewsUSUpdated a day agoCustomer service and refund This is a very unprofessional customer service and unprofessional Manager. This company is a fraud and ripe off . I have never in my life seen anything like this. I never ever seen no company with a fake investigation team and a fake conversation team. How you going to state to a customer that you're not eligible to get a refund back to your account based on number of refunds you have issued. That is not even the policy. This company has a fake escalation team that does not even communicate with you continue to deny your request to have your refund back to you. When I never received the order when you put a note in the description these dashes does not even listen to that. This company has broke policies . And refusing to return my money back to. And all these supervisors are not trained as a professional personnel. When they state to me they can't do anything about it it's a problem. Besides make a complaint who does that it's a horrible service. Food be tampered with from these dashers. So to for them to make a falsifies statement like that it's not correct. They that I am not eligible for a refund on a order that has never got received to me has not provided no photo has not provided me absolutely no compensation or anything This company should not be operating at all they should be closed. Unfortunately this is a very bad business they are not but a scammer. And they refuse to return your money. It takes up to 2 weeks for them to return your money. Then they sit here and screen the phone call. I am a very unhappy customer I don't like how business is being ran have very poor service. And I never seen no company when you request to talk to a supervisor. The only thing they say that oh a supervisor will give you a call back within 24 hours. Then customer service is going to basically sit here and try to argue with you about the issue and try to State the policies. Customer service and supervisors are very unprofessional they hang up the call on you.Date of experience: November 11, 2024Alexander Antonoff1 reviewEENov 3, 2024Very Bad ExperienceThe Dashers were always at least an hour late, and the last time, the order wasn’t delivered at all, with no refund issued.

Date of experience: October 20, 2024JAJay6 reviewsUS6 days agoCan anyone explain why doordash is…Can anyone explain why doordash is being allowed to continue their business practices even though the majority of them are against civil laws in the majority of all states? Why are they allowed to continue to commit shareholder fraud? Why are they allowed to continue to pay less than minimum wage on top of allowing the driver to pay 100% of all expenses incurred? Why does their website claim that deliveries are $2 to $10 even though 95% of all orders are $2, this doesn't matter if it's a mile away or 25 miles away they use the excuse that it wasn't in order that was a demanding order.... Excuse me? How are you to say what is or isn't a demand for a customer's order? How are you able to deceive the customer and still continue business? How are you able to only have arbitration boards and no one can actually use you? Over and over again you are consistently not even slapped on the hand and allowed to pay out pennies to the dollar to end these court cases taking absolutely zero responsibility in the mess that you've caused?. Out of my 40 plus years of being in this world this is by far the most disgusting business practices I have ever seen. We all know why they aren't investigated because just go look at the top five investors of this company two of them are vanguard and blackrock, I think that should explain everything.

One of the most Rudest encounters I’ve had just occurred and I am furious. I placed and order Oct 26, and it was cancelled. I was provided with 2 options to either receive a credit or a refund and I opted for the Refund. I reached out to your team right after I selected the refund and asked how long it take and if I could switch my options. The agent explained why he couldn’t do it and I understood. Fast forward to today, I have no sign of a refund much less any tracking of the funds even coming out. However, if I had taken the immediate credit then I would have that same money in my account to use. The banks send me back to you guys so I inquired about my money. I’m sorry but the Rudeness was uncalled for especially when I’m extremely frustrated.

So the driver cancelled my order while delivery in progress and stole my 2 order's by not delivering my food... customer service were not sincere, just said driver will be penalised but I said he should be FIRED... Customer service said needs to be investigated however, I screenshot the cancellation for proof, customer service should track down the driver, call the driver and question his cancellation action and where's the food! Your dealing with delivery drivers who think they can get away with stealing customers order's... you will be found out drivers.Date of experience: November 02, 2024Kory Fulbright1 reviewUSNov 2, 2024I ordered $60 worth of food and never…I ordered $60 worth of food and never received it.

I hung up. the next thing you know the man called me back time and time again calling me names and saying more and more nasty things. I explained he was rude and I hung up for that reason and calling back this way was even more rude and he just kept on going. SO NOW IT IS ON BLOCKDate of experience: November 01, 2024Lisa Horsman1 reviewUS5 days agoWill never use DoorDash againThis is the email I sent to DoorDash and they will do nothingOn November 3, we ordered two pizzas at approximately 6:00 from a restaurant that is about a 20 minute drive away.  There was an increased delivery fee because of the distance which we were aware of however, our pizzas were picked up about 20-25 minutes later by one of your “drivers” and he didn’t arrive until over an hour later.  Unbelievably the reason was that he was delivering on a bicycle – a distance that is a 20 minute drive!  By that time, the pizzas were soggy, cold and inedible.  We tried to contact customer support but only got automated offer of a $5.00 credit.  As you can see on the attached receipt, between the fees and tip to the so-called “driver”, we paid $29.00 to have food delivered which we couldn’t eat. I called customer service on Monday and explained the whole situation and she said she was the wrong person to talk to and was transferring me to the correct person.  That person, instead of interrupting me, let me go through the whole problem before telling me she was the wrong person because she was dasher support.  She certainly could tell I wasn’t a dasher when I started to tell her the problem.  She said she was transferring me once again and I waited on hold for quite a while.  She then came back on the line and said no one was answering but someone would call me back in 24 to 48 hours.  It has now been past that amount of time with no callback, no resolution. Because of this abysmal customer service experience – from your dasher to your customer service support team – I would like to see if we can get a refund for this order.  The email address for the account is xxxxxx.  Please advise if you can help. Date of experience: November 03, 2024Buddah Gamble1 reviewUSOct 20, 2024Doordash How Low Can You GoThere has been a issue on EVERY doordash order in the past 2 months. Issues have been: the drivers brings someone else's food, the driver leaves the food outside on the ground in front of my door, the driver left my food in my backyard, food never arrived, ordered burger got only the bun, ordered ice cream got burger instead, called driver he came back 20 minutes later my ice cream was a milkshake. Date of experience: October 20, 2024CTChartevia Tomlin1 reviewUSOct 21, 2024refundsDoor dash doesn't allow orders to be cancelled, after placing an order even one minute later you can not cancel the order. This is a problem because when asking for a refund over the phone the agents are advised that an order can not be refunded once placed not even after a second. There are no supervisors according to the live agents on the phone and the best advice they can offer is to not place an order by mistake. Spent $50 mistakenly and was offered $8 to compensate.Date of experience: October 21, 2024Carlos Donley1 reviewUSOct 22, 2024If i could give 0 stars i would stay…If i could give 0 stars i would stay away from these people they delivered my food to the wrong house .

I call customer service she tells me i have to wait 24hr to see if i can get my money back that i spent and they didn’t follow there on guidelines so my response if u deny it what do i do she responds there’s nothing i can do. I send pic the door handle are not even the same plus i have bricks not panels ppl stay way from these ppl they will take your money and don’t nothing about your loss!Date of experience: October 22, 2024NSNot Sure2 reviewsUSOct 28, 2024Does Not Care About the Customer (or Driver)I ordered from a place that uses DoorDash for delivery.

I watched the drivers car sit in one place for 1 and a half hours while my food was getting cold at Taco Bell. I called several times and after picking up, he hung up on me each time.  When his car finally started moving he went straight to Taco Bell. Upon arrival he didnʻt follow instructions and I had to go outside and look for him. I got my food 2 and a half hours later and he lied telling me he had another drop off before mine.  To make matters worse, he only gave me half of my order keeping the other half.  As far as Taco Bell is concerned, they were awesome...I spoke to them several times, they made me a fresh order when the driver arrived and told me that they gave him both bags in my order. I will never use DoorDash again !!!!    UBER EATS ROCKS!!!Date of experience: October 25, 2024MIMichelle 8 reviewsUSOct 18, 2024Save yourself the headache, they are thieves I placed an order through DoorDash and the dasher brought the wrong items.  I immediately contacted DoorDash and their response was that they could not issue a refund based on some canned auto bot answer that I did receive the correct items.  I have screenshots proving what I ordered versus what was delivered.  They refused a refund and closed my case.  I opened a dispute with the BBB and have now been going back and forth with them for over a week.

This is ridiculous.Date of experience: October 23, 2024Jamey Shae3 reviewsUSOct 20, 2024Doordash is TrashDoordash is Trash. If you complain and receive compensation a few times, then support ignores you other than taking your complaint. Thus allowing restaurants to serve you incorrect orders without you receiving help. This is done by most delivery apps, if not all. It's flawed and why im done with doordash now and another over a year ago. Why? Well, half my delivered orders, if delivered at all because a handful don't get to me, are incorrect and i had complained often. They cannot figure out how to utilize accountability for the restaurants in the first place, otherwise this may not be much of a problem. But you gamble when you order from apps. im done. it's expensive anyway. The novelty is gone lolDate of experience: October 19, 2024JMJo M1 reviewAUOct 19, 2024If I could give them zero stars I wouldDoorDash exists to deliver products ordered and paid for by the customer and they can’t manage to do that properly. The delivery was missing an item from our order and they were not remotely interested in resolving the matter. Customer service staff were rude and unhelpful. If I could give them zero stars I would.

Zero customer serviceI ordered pizza but when I paid the address went to a address that was 45 minutes away immediately I called customer service to cancel order they told me to contact the driver and see if he will drive 45 minutes to me what a joke. So I called back a hour later still at pizza place and talked to customer service agian and he hung up on me. So then I got a picture of a business with my pizza on the ground.

Got a notification this morning at 8:00am I accepted the delivery and made it to the pickup point in 20 minutes. When I arrived the store manager told me the package was picked up last night by another driver and the driver didn't know how to mark the package delivered in the app. I messaged FRAYT to tell them what happened and that I was there in less than 30 minutes. I was told there would be no compensation. I reminded the person that I was there within the 30-minute timeline and that there was no package there for me to pick up. Again, I was told that I would not be compensated for the attempted pick up.If this is how they treat drivers especially when the fault lies with them, I'd rather shovel horse sh!t.Stay far away from this company if you're looking for a side hustle.Date of experience: September 07, 2024AdvertisementRachel Nguyen1 reviewUSAug 30, 2024SCAMThis business is a scam. They require drivers to pay a $40 background check fee but did not even conduct the background check before completely denying my application, due to something as minuscule as just increasing my insurance policy. They try to use their Terms of Service against people in order to keep their money instead of allowing applicants to rectify any issues. Their business model is unethical and delivery drivers who are just looking to make money instead of have their money taken from them, should steer clear from this company.Date of experience: August 30, 2024Sharon4 reviewsUSJul 22, 2024If I could give this company zero…If I could give this company zero stars, I would they trap you into paying  for the application fee neglect to tell you that you need specific insurance coverage which I did not see. I applied for the application only to be denied. I don’t have money to give out to people for free, this company steals money from their customers . Not to mention, I’ve asked to speak to supervisor twice or a manager, and nobody can give me any information as far as how to get a hold of a supervisor or manager to take care of the situation. Do not apply with this company they will take your money and deny you.!!!!!!Date of experience: July 22, 2024SESelina1 reviewUSNov 8, 2023InvitedOne of the better onesI have worked with a lot of different logistics companies over the years and Frayt is one of the best.  Frayt is professional with every aspect I have felt with them.  Sometimes companies are less than helpful when you are not on their platform Frayt gave me a way to communicate and communicated with me promptly.  The only reason I gave them 4 stars is there isn’t enough work to keep me busy all day. I would drop everything else if they had the work.

The problem is that there isn’t very much work. And what there is is snapped up by bots. Other companies have successfully defeated the bots, but Frayt apparently doesn't see it as a big deal because the work is getting done. Well, I do think it’s a big deal because it affects my bottom line.Date of experience: May 25, 2023SHShiller1 reviewUSMay 19, 2023InvitedI like the way that the orders come…I like the way that the orders come through the system. I like the communication between the driver and the service personnel.

After getting notifications for jobs from this app for countless weeks, I think I may have done only one or two jobs for this app. Far too many notifications for jobs that are not even available, or were taken by some automated software someone else is using.

I applied and the application was rejected because I entered my Cargo VAN instead of my SUV for deliveries. They still charged a $35.00 background check fee even though they never intended to approve the application. They gave the excuse that their APP says the fee in Non-Refundable but the APP also states that a Background Check would be performed AFTER approval and before the APP can be used. Low life companies like this just steal background fees from anyone who applies. I actually disputed the charge since it is ILLEGAL charging someone for something that you didn't provide. I will also be filing a complaint with the FTC so they can check out the scam they are playing on many drivers.

Not enough work in 2023. Platform was better during pandemic but never really had a ton of available work. Now it's not worth the time or energy needed in watching the platform for when something \"may\" appear, because chances of actually securing the gig is almost impossible. The last experience I had really left a sour taste in my mouth, when I actually got a route for deliveries out of Lisle, IL and was then bumped off the route because the business placing the gig wanted to request a certain driver!

This company's idea of customer service in Paris is (1) hang up on you after you've waited from 8:am to 5:30 pm for a delivery which never came. (2) Lie that the delivery was actually attempted. Update: That said, I managed to contact a person at the Paris headquarters of Geodis who was quite sympathatic and cooperative and who promised to have a general manager get in touch with me to work out a new delivery at a time convenient for me. It's clear that some people in the company in Paris do care about customer service.

I states being delivered by Geodis on their website. They transferred the parcel to Purolator apparently. Purolator can't track my package. Amazon is sending me to Geodis...So I call Geodis in Mirabel. I say \"Hello, I,ve recently ordered a package from Amazon...\" I am interrupted immediately and told that it's not Amazon. I know this. I tried telling the woman over the phone who only talked over me and hung up never letting me finish my sentence. I call back and she continues talking over me. I raise my voice asking me to finish my request. She proceeds to tell me I'm harassing her and that I'm wasting her HOUR of work and that \"we have your number\". This is werong on so many levels.Short story: I can't figure out where my package is or track where it's been pawned off. This woman needs to be fired immediately.Date of experience: April 10, 2019AdvertisementBEBenTheBlaster1 reviewUSMay 12, 2021I got scammed 6 dollars for same day…I got scammed 6 dollars for same day delivery, and I can’t track my package. This has to be the worst delivery service.Date of experience: May 12, 2021CHCheryl7 reviewsGBNov 30, 2017AwfulHaving found a great deal online, I ordered my item...The item hadn't arrived after a few days and the 'schedule your delivery' button did not work on the automated tracking email. After getting stuck in a phone loop multiple times and after much Googling I found a number for the correct depot. If you've ever tried contacting Northampton Geodis you'll understand how tricky this is. They were very pleasant and helpful and advised when the parcel would arrive. So I waited 2 days at home for it (after the second day being told there had been an accident). Being that I work, and couldn't waste another day, Geodis recommended I pick a designated day that week, which I did... HOWEVER... Update (1 day later - 3 working days late): Have just had a David Lynch moment and received a notification saying that my parcel has been signed for, by 'myself' however I have not been home all day (this was not my 'new' designated delivery day). I will not be happy if this has been left with a neighbour as it clearly states to check the item thoroughly. Very stressful experience thus far.Update (later that evening)Well... Not to worry, it wasn't responsibly left with a neighbour as I just got home to find my £750+ digital piano hanging out, on my doorstep (in South East London) in the drizzle, in full view of any Tom, Brian or Harry, with the name of the product on full display and the box battered like a good piece of Weymouth cod.After unpacking the piano, everything seems to be ok, however it does sound a bit like soggy bagpipes, hopefully this will resolve itself as it dries out.If you want your goods dropped on your doorstep for all to see, whatever the weather, go for it. Bonne chance.Date of experience: November 30, 2017SRSuriyah Rashid3 reviewsGBAug 1, 2019Ridiculous is an understatementAvoid, avoid, avoid. For reference, I purchased a large expensive mirror from Maisons du Monde, and had no prior information that the courier company they deal with is Geodis. In short:Geodis is the most appalling courier company I have ever had to deal with. Hermes/DPD look like the saintliest of angels in comparison.1. The lack of pre-arrangement is beyond worrying (given Maisons du Monde sell expensive furniture items) and I had no way of tracking my item. When clicking on the tracking link in the email sent by Maisons du Monde, on the Geodis website it stated \"no consignment found\". A helpful start. 2. An unknown number of days later, I received a call from a random driver from DX Courier (who? where?!) who had my name and delivery but the completely wrong postcode and address. I had to rectify this by calling DX and having the correct address re-applied (the lady on the phone told me that the French aren't great with postcodes - how helpful for UK deliveries!!). She told me that I would be able to rearrange my delivery online with the same shipment number we both had recorded, but alas, this number did not provide any tracking on both DX and Geodis websites, naturally. **I am appalled at the lack of transparency as to where my delivery was, between different couriers, given it was a large, expensive item.**3. I rang Geodis to \"rearrange\" my delivery date as the driver from DX Courier told me there was nothing he could do. The person I called from Geodis seemed pretty ambivalent about the whole situation, and that an email would be sent out \"within the next couple of days\" to change my delivery date. 4. Just one day later, when I came home from work, my mirror was dumped outside my front door - I had no prior warning and no email to rearrange the date. This is disgusting business practice and the only reason I refuse to send this item back is because I do not want the hassle of dealing with Geodis again. Maisons du Monde should remove this courier from their services.Date of experience: August 01, 2019GEGeorge Efstathiou6 reviewsGBApr 28, 2021The worst...delivery everThe worst delivery everDate of experience: April 27, 2021AdvertisementShow reviews in all languages.

We called him and he refused to return. There was no way to reach a human and the auto generated responses were worthless. Rescheduled for today - drivers showed with arrogant and rude attitude. Set up table. We asked for them to wait while we inspected so we could sing off. They said we didn't need to sign off and we could take up any issues with the company. The table was damaged. On the way out the drivers left a mess. This visual company lacks the process and infrastructure to provide an appropriate customer  experience.

Today marks the 3rd day where 'item loaded in truck' I'm waiting for another message saying delivery attempt unsuccessful at 820pm.  One day the item sat in one location according to their map for an entire afternoon until I finally received a delivery attempt unsuccessful. My question is why get a job doing last mile if you don't want to deliver a backpack to an apartment building. What's the issue?  I've never left a negative review but this feels really annoying. I can't get a hold of a real person. I did receieve a  text from AMNINDER SINGH October 3 asking for door code. I texted back and also double checked delivery info - door code info was there.

Because they released new refferal program with 20 euros bonus and don't pay that bonus to many users for completed requirements. So why you release that bonus program if you cannot afford to payout bonuses for users? If low budget company, they can bankrupt one day, and freeze users money :DDate of experience: March 31, 2024Reply from NashApr 5, 2024Thank you for joining our referral program. We want to let you know that after a careful review of all submissions, unfortunately, some did not align with the criteria specified in the program's guidelines. As you chose to remain anonymous in your review, it's difficult to determine your eligibility for a reward. Nevertheless, we've rewarded hundreds of participants who met all the requirements and demonstrated genuine interest in our app. Addressing your concern about potential financial loss, please be assured that our wallets are completely decentralized. This ensures that, even in the unlikely event of our insolvency, your funds remain secure. This safety measure also extends to the IBAN accounts we provide. Whether Nash continues to operate or not, your funds remain yours and are protected from becoming part of any insolvency proceedings, unlike the situation with FTX and others. This commitment to security is why our users trust us with their finances over other platforms that may offer less protection.MSMatt S.2 reviewsDEOct 25, 2024Crypto how its meant to be - non-custodial.I’ve been using Nash since around 2019/2020, and I’m continually impressed by their dedication to enhancing the customer experience.Rather than taking the easier route of custodial crypto services, Nash has committed to building a unique blend of a non-custodial wallet and banking service. This approach gives users the full power of a non-custodial wallet—complete with essential features like WalletConnect—right alongside the convenience of a personal IBAN account. While non-custodial services can sometimes be slightly slower or come with extra network fees, the ability to maintain complete control over your crypto holdings is well worth it and aligns perfectly with the core principles of cryptocurrency.Looking forward, with upcoming European regulations like MiCA, Nash appears well-positioned to thrive. From day one, they’ve embraced a compliance-focused approach, setting a solid foundation for sustainable growth within the regulatory framework.I wholeheartedly recommend Nash to both beginners and intermediate users. They provide an incredibly straightforward gateway into and out of crypto, backed by a feature-rich wallet and the seamless functionality of an IBAN account.Date of experience: October 24, 2024Read 1 more review about NashBOBogdanLord3 reviewsROApr 4, 2024Scam App Don't installThey had a referral campaign and for every friend who joins and purchase crypto you will receive 20€ bonus.

Also traditional big banks are very anti crypto. The Nash iban allows me to keep my crypto investments seperated from my traditional bank business. Last week I sold some BTC and send the euro's over to a other investment platform. The transaction got flagged for manual review (EU rules) but things got sorted out within 12 hours (Had to wait for business hours) In the meantime Nash support kept me updated about the process.

I bought NEX tokens, never sold them. I've been using their exchange and buy all my cryptos from there. Their non-custodial wallet convinced me to start using it, but the easiness of the app made me stay.

You can hold or buy or trade Nash at a non custodial way that means that there is no way for the platform to know your password or keys so you can withdraw at any time even at the most impossible senario.

Despite meeting the conditions that have not been received, for making the decision. If you are registered, you will not receive any funds just for registering, nor will my registrants. I contacted the company and the service to complain about the decision because the conditions were met correctly, and then I was told \"you are a bonus hunter\" and you are not entitled to a reward. Very bad solution from a customer who actually used the services and shared the services with friends. I tried to contact you and solve the matter differently, but I realized that the prizes will not actually be paid due to a number of unusual actions that occurred: extension of the prize payment deadline to 30 days, announcement of the 2nd tranche of the prize payment, strange, inappropriate additional verifications or even logging out of the account. all users after the update where a large number of people had problems with logging in (they reserve the right to take over the funds if you do not have access to the account)Date of experience: April 13, 2024PSPhilip Soluppgång5 reviewsITUpdated Jun 24, 2021The investor side of the story.Nash may be good for the common users/traders, but it's just bad from an investor's point of view.Formerly Neon EXCHANGE, coming from an ICO where they raised $25.000.000 with the premise to create a groundbreaking regulated non-custodial exchange and to give 75% of the fees collected from the exchange to the investors. Sounds nice uh?It took about 2 years to get the exchange online, meanwhile, the hype about it died, the exchange was nice when it first got out, but then it has been totally abandoned, and now they say it was their choice, that the focus is on being a crypto BANK (yes, really).They refused to add new pairs to the exchange, they didn't add new features, bad marketing, they made a mobile app which is nice but it's not enough, they made a fiat ramp which is ok but not enough to compete with coinbase/binance/etc. even if you save a little in fees, and now they are trying to not drawn in a crypto space that meanwhile evolved at the speed of light (DeFi and better technologies).The result for the ICO investors who invested only for the dividends (because otherwise, the token is useless) is less than $100.000 volume per day, and the dividends in years have been near to zero.And good luck buying NEX tokens, they still couldn't list it in their exchange because \"we're a security, we are regulated\", switcheo dex is closed, tokok is shady, and uniswap liquidity is close to 0 and anyway no-one gives a monkeys about it because there's no point in buying NEX tokens, and of course the price reflects this, so guess what... It seems that being religiously regulated doesn't pay in the end.Date of experience: June 24, 2021Reply from NashUpdated Oct 20, 2023We regret that you feel this way about your investment in the NEX token. However, these comments have little bearing on Nash’s products and services. Rather, they reflect your own expectations regarding the performance of a high-risk investment.While crypto investors may desire returns of 10x or more in a short period, this cannot be ensured. At the time of writing, the NEX token continues to trade on secondary markets around the ICO price of $1, so investors have not lost money. With our on-going Series A fundraise and new line-up of products, we believe the company has a bright future ahead.We would also like to address a number of false or confused statements in your review.> It took about 2 years to get the exchange onlineThis claim is false. The ICO was held in September 2018 and the exchange went online in September 2019.> it has been totally abandonedThis claim is false. The Layer-2 exchange continues to operate at https://app.nash.io/trade/, with continuous improvements being made to the API.> They refused to add new pairs to the exchange,We focused on pairs that were wanted by the community and showed enough volume to sustain. We further added new pairs experimentally and tested the volume on the live system, but had to remove some of them again, due to low demand. Examples are LINK and NOIA, which were both highly anticipated by the community.> The result for the ICO investors who invested only for the dividends (because otherwise, the token is useless) is less than $100.000 volume per day, and the dividends in years have been near to zero.Monthly average exchange volume has recently been over $50 million. You may have received fewer dividends than you hoped for, but they have not been “near to zero”. What’s more, Nash has added multiple new revenue streams from our new products, which will also benefit NEX holders.> good luck buying NEX tokens, they still couldn't list it in their exchange because \"we're a security, we are regulated\", switcheo dex is closed, tokok is shady, and uniswap liquidity is close to 0It is straightforward to purchase NEX tokens on Uniswap, where liquidity is ample: 170,000 tokens on the NEX/ETH pair and 384,000 tokens on the NEX/USDC pair at the time of writing.

On one occasion they came by when I was out, because the estimated delivery time was totally wrong. The driver was trying to deliver nearly a mile away from my address, so the guidance I tried to give him on the phone was totally useless – luckily he eventually found it on his own. To avoid similar issues of being out I decided to order again while working from home. For nearly two hours now I've been shown there are two stops before me, and the delivery time keeps getting pushed back. How is that helpful at all? I have no idea when the order will actually come, completely ruining my planning for the rest of the day. This would be so much more useful with a better live tracking service, like DPD offer, so I could at least know if the driver is anywhere in my vicinity or halfway across the city stuck in traffic.Date of experience: September 13, 2024AdvertisementPrevious1Next pageCompany activitySee allClaimed profileHasn’t replied to negative reviewsAdvertisementAbout OnfleetInformation written by the companyOnfleet is the easiest way to manage and analyze your last mile delivery operations.Contactsales@onfleet.com703 Market Street94103San FranciscoUnited StatesCategoryBusiness ServicesPeople who looked at this company also looked atSamsara343ClaimedBig Green Coach1,486ClaimedSHIPHYPE Fulfillment20ClaimedSuggested companies are based on people’s browsing tendencies.The Trustpilot ExperienceWe're open to allAnyone can write a Trustpilot review.

Every agent had a different response about my item: 'The package got lost', 'The package is in LA, California (not my location)', 'The package is in Phoenix, Arizona (my location), and out for delivery', 'We have no more updates for your package, please ask for a refund'.....it got out of hand really fast.The customer service is faulty. I spent at least two hours on the phone, and when they answered, it was someone in China that had no clue what was going on.Please, NEVER use PiggyShip for anything......PiggyShip is the worst delivery company ever.Date of experience: November 11, 2024SNSNM3 reviewsUS4 days agoTerrible experience with Piggy Ship Piggy Ship was contracted by Pridola Design to deliver my package to SF Bay Area once it cleared customs at LAX.  Piggy Ship has held my package in LA for 9 days so far without attempting to get it to me.  I have emailed them and they just said to \"be patient.\"  It should have arrived within two days.  Pridola Design also has been no help whatsoever in trying to expedite delivery.  What a terrible experience.  Do not use either company!Date of experience: November 08, 2024MEMedina1 reviewUS6 days agoI just received a email fail to attempt…I just received a email fail to attempt delivery ..LIES!!!!

I will be notifying Pay PalDate of experience: October 19, 2024Sabrina Loe1 reviewUSOct 30, 2024Absolute scammers and liarsAbsolute scammers and liars. They could not find my easy address, then blamed me. I've waited 4 days and they just keep saying that \"your driver will deliver it tomorrow\". It is NEVER here \"tomorrow\". I am trying to contact Tiktok shop to ban this ridiculous scamming delivery service.Date of experience: October 29, 2024Adam D Barret1 reviewUSOct 23, 2024Driver slander of our business by posting review accusing us of being racistThe driver for this company posted a review of our business right after he delivered a package accusing us of being racist.  We contacted PiggyShip to let them know what happened and could not reach them by phone.  Via chat, the customer service agent was incredibly rude and stated that if the package was delivered they cannot assist us. This is so unprofessional and slanderous.  We would like to speak to someone from Piggy Ship regarding this interaction and behavior by their employee.Date of experience: October 23, 2024GIGigi3 reviewsUSOct 14, 2024Would give them zero stars if I couldWould give them zero stars if I could...Probably the worst courier service in the United States. Package goes missing and there's no updates and no follow-up by customer service. Customer service just gives you lip service and ghosts if you follow-up with them to see if they've done anything whatsoever to help you with delivering your package. I'm not sure how they're even in business, considering that they, not only have horrible customer service, but don't do what they're being paid to do.Date of experience: October 04, 2024CUcustomer5 reviewsUSOct 17, 2024Worst Service…Honestly this is the worst service company I've ever experienced. They are just plain terrible. Its so hard to get a hold of them (I waited on an online chat for over an hour). When I spoke to someone on the phone they mentioned they couldn't deliver the package because the area is inaccessible. I live on a public street, anyone can walk up to the front door so it was all BS. She promised to call me back and of course never did. STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY AS POSSIBLE. You'll never receive your items. I assume they're stealing them and making up excuses. Date of experience: October 16, 2024Angelena Wilson1 reviewUSUpdated May 12, 2024Driver stole my package and uploaded bogus delivery picturesUPDATE: On May 11, the package miraculously appeared on my doorstep. Rating changed from 1* to 3*. I guess my repeated emails to customer service did some good, albeit they never answered me. Original Review: I had a package from Temu that was supposed to be delivered by May 6. At 10:57pm on May 6, the piggy ship driver uploaded 3 pictures of my package in his hand in his car and the package in his backseat and also a picture of some random person‘s front door with a random thin package on the ground, which obviously was not my door and not my package because my package was thick and bulky and contained a lot of items. Called piggy Customer Service and they don’t answer the phone. All voicemail box are full. Emailed piggy for them to only tell me the package shows delivered in the system. I sent an email asking for an escalation for an investigation as to the driver’s theft of my package and haven’t heard back. I’m so angry because 3 of the items I ordered or have been discontinued and I can no longer get on Temu!!Date of experience: May 05, 2024SVSocorro Valderrama1 reviewMXApr 15, 2024NO COMMON SENSE/COURTESYPiggy Ship delivers my package but leaves it in plain sight of the front door. Instead of simply placing the pkg on the porch chair or maybe slightly hidden out of view, how difficult would that have been? Piggy Ship I presume does not have common sense for porch theft. Date of experience: April 13, 2024Tristan Ballard1 reviewUSOct 22, 2024Delivered to wrong addressDelivered to wrong address, package ultimately lost/stolen because of it. It's their only job.

Still nothing. Absolutely terrible company and Temu for using them your better off with ShienDate of experience: September 17, 2024Kim Monroe1 reviewUSAug 31, 2024Two times had packages from Temu that…Two times had packages from Temu that were supposed to be delivered by this company and both times they did not deliver my package because said they had no access code. There is no access code to deliver my packages, considering all of our apartments are outside and they have their own private entrances. The workers are either lazy or incompetent. So who knows when I will get my packages if I get my packages. Date of experience: August 30, 2024KalaKoaKid1 reviewUSOct 24, 2024EXTREMELY HORRIBLE SERVICE THEY DESERVE…EXTREMELY HORRIBLE SERVICE THEY DESERVE NO STARS, AN INVESTIGATION AND A LAWSUIT! I ordered thru temu before and the first two orders were delivered from piggyship, no issue those two times. Now, this third time i order, the driver is marking the deliveries as #1: failed delivery, no access code. i called piggyship and the number on their contact info on temu isnt even in service anymore. tried calling the the number they had provided on the recording....ended up on hold for 6 hrs. emailed piggyship and they only responded because i filed a complaint about the delivery issue to the BBB. temu said they contacted the driver and requested they come back here. #2 attempt: the driver marked the package as \"failed delivery. address is unaccessible. i reached out the same way as the first time but didnt stay on hold for more than 30 mins. im not staying on hold for 6 hrs again. so i emailed the bbb and told them the delivery issue still hasnt been resolved. I asked the manager and the employees of my apartment complex if someone from piggyship came to deliver a package to me and they said no. so i told them the same thing. the apartment complex  manager said it sounds like the delivery driver for the piggyship delivery company is planning on stealing my packages. currently waiting for the bbb to respond back. with the gate currently not working, the apartment complex left the gate wide open. i dont understand how the complex was not accessible when people are coming and going, as well as other delivery companies were able to deliver. even walmart delivers to tenants at my complex. unfortunately i too have a strong gut feeling that with there being an issue delivering my package, the delivery person marking \"no access code\" and \" address is not accessible\" when it is, has me getting extremely strong feelings that the delivery driver(s) handling my package is working on stealing my order.Date of experience: October 21, 2024TIa Taylor1 reviewUSOct 15, 2024So I ordered a few things off the Temu…So I ordered a few things off the Temu app I ordered a few things I’ve never had a problem with receiving my orders until piggy express came into the picture I didn’t receive my package their customer service is very poor customer service Temu should really drop them as a delivery service because they steal your packages and send u a picture of it saying it’s been delivered but it doesn’t be there they are going to make Temu look very bad Date of experience: October 15, 2024Jacquia Lindsay1 reviewUSAug 21, 2024So far no GoodSo far, no good. I've been waiting 4 days for my package to clear customs. No updates on progress. My other packages ordered on the same day, same online retailer, but shipped by a different company, arrived days ago! I needed these items in time for my kids to start school. Unfortunately, I don't think they'll arrive in time so I had to spend even more money on Amazon for a few back to school outfits. Date of experience: August 20, 2024Krystal Roark2 reviewsUSUpdated Sep 3, 2024Some complications but received 1 of 2 packages I give 2 stars for phone service & reaching someone on their customer service # which i can tell in her voice she sound like she was trying to convince herself more than me that the packages were there safe & on their way that their just short employees to sort packages to get them out, however that may be true but to many customers are having to many issues, with missing, damaged packages & scammers, the list goes on! I will be calling the BBB / better business bureau tomorrow! I do not understand how TEMU or others continues to partner and ship with this last mile shipping company aka piggyship. There are complaints all over the internet. They are literally stealing peoples hard earned money / packages that are just MIA! No updated tracking info. My packages have been in their warehouse 11 days now & all a sudden on Labor Day it says out for delivery which is bull, no one delivers on Labor Day/ RARELY an if so not this apparent non trust worthy company. You guys are losing partnership & customers due to incompetence & neglect & theft! Google this shipping company everyone. I have $200 invested in the packages I’m waiting on & have been waiting on since August 20th but purchased Aug. 14th my packages have been in their warehouse since August 21st. It’s literally a scam this company. I believe TEMU & other large companies are dealing with this company trying to cut costs & are cutting the wrong costs. Future business will be impacted through regular faithful customers & companies of these companies! Who’s items get shipped with piggyship/express with no say or choice in the matter. I’ve never had an issue with DHL, UPS or USPS then this company comes along with nothing but complaints and my packages MIA. I took a loan out for my items I ordered through TEMU. I need my packageS! It’s been since August 14th when I made my purchase. TEMU & others, STOP dealing with this scam of a company Piggyship. Your going to lose many customers & partnerships! If this issue is not resolved today or tomorrow, I will be calling the better business bureau on TEMU For continuing to use this last mile shipping company AND THIS particular shipping company PIGGYSHIP/PIGGYEXPRESS for scamming, incompetence & neglect! However, if I by some miracle happen to receive my packages, I will come back and edit this review, better yet & I’ll write another review if allowed piggybacking off of this review for my doubt & misjudgment if that’s even the case! Based off what I’ve read online, I do not have confidence in receiving my packages through this company unless I happen to receive them I will never have confidence and knowing my items are safe!EDIT- I apologize, my fault! I should have waited, at least the day out because like I said, it did say it was out for delivery today/Lavor Day & moments after leaving this review, of course my package was delivered successfully! However, there is part of my package that is still yet to be delivered which I really hope it makes it to me safely. I had 11 items in my package today. Everything was accounted for nothing was missing. Nothing was damaged. I am waiting on one last package with three items. I will edit this again once that arrives. This may be a last mile shipping company, but the two drivers were very nice & respectful. Also there have been complications with my address before, we have issues with food delivery and other deliveries because my mailbox doesn't point to the street my address says. It's actually on the street beside me, it's complicated but I figured it was them and flagged them down. I confirmed my information and got my package. Luckily I was paying attention tho and looking out because I'm already aware of the complications we have from time to time & complications with my address from the past, but yes, at this moment my choices of  calling the BBB is put on hold because I had no issues with PiggyShip yet, I'm still waiting on one more package though. I will edit this review once I receive it and here is proof that I received my package today. Kudos to the company for delivering on Labor Day as well.Date of experience: September 02, 2024CUcustomer2 reviewsUSAug 5, 2024My shipping number was duplicatedMy shipping number was duplicated, and someone else received my package.

This last so called attempt of non delivery, I was told about they couldn't deliver because they couldn't find the address!  And about some construction in the next block.  Our address is in large numbers on our building, on the awning in front of the building, and the only condominium on the block since we take up the whole block!!  All you have to do is ring the bell, concierge opens door, give concierge the pkg!! So simple!!! Never had a problem receiving any other pkgs!!  Not until this Piggyshit!!

When I reached out via chat the first time to follow-up on that phone call the rep replied. \"well it was not rescheduled... It is what it is. I hope you can receive your package tomorrow.\" and ended the chat.   I reached out today \"your package is in the warehouse...due to unexpected delay such as high volume of packages, lack of warehouse people or drivers etc.). Once the package is ready, we will deliver it in the next two days, thanks a lot!.\" When I asked a simple follow-up question about what caused the delivery not to be made the day it was out for delivery and why I had to reach out to try and have it rescheduled the guy replied \"thanks for your enquiries, have a good day!\" and ended the chat.I don't understand how this company hopes to survive in the US market with this type of service.Date of experience: September 12, 2024MDMarion Davis1 reviewUSApr 29, 2024Delivery person doesn't read the delivery address carefullyMy packages were left at the right number on the wrong Street Three times this past week. fortunately I was able to trace where it was since I must drive by the incorrect house to get out to a main road in my neighborhood.Date of experience: April 28, 2024MAMs Arnette1 reviewUSMay 14, 2024I ordered from Temu and received my…I ordered from Temu and received my packages from Piggyship. A photo was taken where they left my merchandise in the lobby of my apartment bldg. They didn't bother to ring my doorbell and let me know they had delivered my packages. A thoughtful neighbor saw the packages and informed me. Had he not it's possible I would have not received them. This kind of service make it easy for packages to be stolen. Date of experience: April 22, 2024Shakirah9 reviewsUSApr 3, 2024So badSo bad! If I find out they are delivering I will cancel the order. I live in building 32 apt #2 and they delivered my package to building 2 and threw it behind the building near the stairs that lead to the boiler room basement. The best part is they took pictures that's how I knew where it was. 2 of the 3 pictures were of the package while in the van or something, not a picture of it being delivered. Thank goodness I was able to ask the maintenance man to go find it for me while I was at work. When you call the toll free number it goes to a voicmail that's full.

Twice now, I caught the driver putting the packages in my mailbox, all he did was grin at me when I repeated \"NO MAILBOX!!\" several times - he obviously didn't speak English (he was clearly Chinese, like the owner of Piggyship). I pointed at the mailbox and said \"NO!\" again and again, then pointed at my gate and made gestures on where to leave it. So, he comes back a week later and puts it in my mailbox AGAIN! I sent an email to Piggyship, and they replied a day or so later with this boilerplate response: \"Dear customer, we have received your message, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience. We will ensure to enforce strict standards for our drivers. Thank you, and we wish you a pleasant day!\"The same message was sent to me both times. I have to wonder how many others lost their packages due to their incompetence?Date of experience: February 09, 2024BABrenda Acosta1 reviewUSJun 8, 2024Would give 0 stars if possibleWould give 0 stars if possible.

You should buy any products shipped with this company. My order from Temu did not update from the day of shipping until it was out for delivery. Then it didn't get delivered and delivery was rescheduled without saying when. If you call them on the phone they keep you waiting for a long time hoping you hang up. If you press 0 to speak to someone they tell you the mailbox is full goodby and they hang up. If you wish to try it for yourself the phone number is (800)  690-2256.  Next time I order from Temu and they ship with Piggyship I will cancel the order before it leaves the warehouse. Stay away from this company at cost.Date of experience: January 23, 2024RORoxanne4 reviewsUSJun 1, 2024Piggy express that should bike cycle express.OMG. Where do I start.

It a couple it will be June 6, 2024 & I still haven’t received my package. I tried contacting them by phone & that was a problem. They give you their new telephone number but no one answers & it puts you on hold and then within a few minutes you are disconnected. I emailed them and the response was that they would contact the driver & for me to have a happy life. This has been the worst experience I’ve ever had with a shipping company. DO NOT USE THEM.

This is a safety matter and Shipt blew me off when I called.It's also a matter of the quality of the shopping.  I ordered 7 bananas.  Instead I got 7 bunches of bananas.  There were so many more problems with the order that I think the person who did the shopping had no clue about what they were doing.If you rate the shopper 1 or 2 you won't get them again (maybe).

Then delivery got more scarce. And so did the pay. I had many regular customers because you'd see some of the info so I knew who I was delivering for. Lately there's nothing in my area now. Pay should be based on how large & how far orders go. I have a standard size SUV that's been packed and pay is barely anything. It's a lot of work dropping off all those groceries people.

I was a shopper for 5 years and I was assaulted, they deactivated my account . Perfect stats for 5 years 10k orders. They literally robbed me of everything I worked so hard for. 7 days a week for 5 years I built my customer base I worked incredibly hard. New shoppers I’ve seen are awful. They shop with a lot of other people and don’t even have the right person delivering the order. They don’t look at dates and don’t care at all for any of your items.

As a shopper I waited over 15 minutes to get connected while I had a timed order in process. Then I had to cancel an order because I'd never make it. I was also dinged for being late when it was the fault of Shipt not figuring it my problem. Pay is rotten, even with an occasional tip. People don't tip because they think we make over $16/hr because that's what Shipt advertises to the public. Not a well organized company.

I don’t do shipt often and just because of that i got disabled with only an email to refer to. It’s very unfair and you guys don’t even consider the progress and quality of my services. I have even helping shoppers on the job, you can ask the people i’ve shopped for how much i do so I’m just disappointed and disgusted with this entire situation. I deserve another chance i deserved the opportunity to redeem myself and everyone needs a longer grace period!

I have talked to multiple people who work for the company and they seem to think the pay is not worth it. I am wondering if it’s taking longer because the workers aren’t happy with their job so they are less motivated. With having the availability of Door dash now I think the company has to add perks for their workers and customers if they want to be able to compete with all the newer options.Date of experience: December 18, 2023Cathy Lepper1 reviewUSOct 17, 2024What went wrongWhat went wrong?

Much easier experience.  I switched to ordering from target bc in general, I think they treat their employees better, but Idc about better when my child is sick and they f up the order twice.  Just stick with Walmart Date of experience: October 07, 2024AdvertisementJessica Jones1 reviewUSAug 24, 2023Did you know Shipt does upcharges on…Did you know Shipt does upcharges on items and doesn't do sale prices and adds sales tax??My shopper accidentally gave me the store receipt and I was charged about $30 more for my items plus I paid the shipping membership, plus a tip on the higher total (no major issue)plus she missed an item(not terrible but added $4 and I had to get that refunded). Just upset at all the hidden costs.Date of experience: August 20, 2023SHSharon3 reviewsUSOct 8, 2024Everyone steer clear of using ShiptEveryone steer clear of using Shipt!  Today the shopper accepted my order, never offered communication during the shop, substituted items without permission (probably changing items to her liking), then never delivered my groceries. The app requires the shopper to take photgraphic evidence of the delivery so she submitted a photo of a random house with no groceries in the picture!   Shipt customer service tried to reach the shopper but was unsuccessful.  I think it’s safe to say “Leah” walked away with $161 in free groceries today. The Shipt customer service team did NOTHING to help me out.

First, everything is around 5% more expensive on Shipt (they even admit so in help.shipt dot com /pricing/how-are-your-prices-determined ) -- so why do they charge shipping & handling on top? Scammy.On top of that, free shipping only applies above $35, which means that you'll probably pay the same or less ordering directly from the source even with a delivery fee (esp. if small).On top of that, you don't find the same products or ofers on the Shipt platform! E.g. CVS and Walgreens have great discounts for vitamins but those never come up in Shipt.I made several test runs on different stores and it's consistently more expensive on Shipt.Who comes up with these \"business models\" ? \"I know, let's become a middleman and have people pay MORE to order in a more complicated way!\" Do they think that we are dumb?Date of experience: April 25, 2024LTLee Tilton3 reviewsUSOct 5, 2024Failure to deliver item cost me money Driver texted me for directions and received them.

Date of experience: October 05, 2024AdvertisementDanielle Mahon1 reviewUSJul 3, 2024Don’t Get Too Comfortable If you follow the app and really do the lessons you can become very good at making money with Shipt. Downside is you’re an Independent contractor. Tips are the only way to make money. Shops start at $4 and up. Tips is where you make a living. Another downside is their help line has some who help but mainly copy and paste of what you learned in the lessons. So if you have a question or problem check the Hub. They will also deactivate you for no reason and claim a reason in the contract but not be specific. Don’t get comfortable with 100 Preferred members and all 5 stars and they will drop you while delivering. They don’t care for their customers or their shoppers they just care about the money and if you are making 900- $1000 working 20 hours they will deactivate you with no legitimate reason and if you try to find out you will just get the run around and a bunch of copy and paste from customer service.

Moving on, I did not expect to have to tip the delivery person because I thought Shipt paid them.

I did not even know who Shipt was.  I noticed the improper charge within two days of the charge posting. Dealing with Shipt to get it removed was a joke. I spent 25 minutes on the phone with them verifying the charge, only then be told to email all the details to a Shipt email address. I was told via return email they would get back to me within 48 hours. After 6 days I had not heard from them and  I filed a fraud complaint, which I should have done sooner. Subsequently, I received an email stating that since the transaction had been “captured?”, I should file a fraud complaint. It was not a pleasant experience and it was not handled professionally.

I shop at target a lot and things worked very well initially. Now in the last six weeks I have placed three orders and every single one was delayed-the one today was even pushed over to tomorrow which meant I had no dinner and nothing to drink. It has been very inconvenient-twice I had to delay an appt so that I could sit and wait the extra time for the delivery. I hope that they break that trend soonDate of experience: August 25, 2023COConfused2 reviewsUSOct 5, 2024Shipt Tells you when they can deliver Ordered twice from Shipt. I was missing an item from the first order and received the wrong size of another item I ordered. It was only 7 items total - not a large order. Shipt changed the delivery time to another time that I had to be at an appointment. Not ideal having your perishable groceries sitting outside but I needed them to make my son dinner. Second order was scheduled for the next day because they couldn’t find a shopper. No apology. When I called customer care, she kept on going on and on how short they were of drivers I explained that was not my problem and she continued to tell me that they had a shopper but she bailed on my order. I’m not sure why I would order something to be delivered tonight if I wanted it tomorrow. I asked the agent if she needed diapers for her baby, would she be happy if I told her she wasn’t getting them till tomorrow. She didn’t understand my point. No apology. Like it was my fault for placing  the order tonight. I told her I was going to cancel my Shipt membership because I don’t want to pay h do or a service that delivers my groceries on THEIR schedule. Isn’t the whole purpose of delivery having the customer get them Jen they want them?

Is Price Gouging REALLY Necessary??Using the Shipt site means you pay a membership fee either monthly, semi-annually or annually. My issue is even though we are paying these fees for access to Shipt, they are actually gouging prices. I found out that shoppers aren't suppose to give receipts to clients. I found out why. The prices in the store are considerably lower than the price given for the same item on the Shipt site...anywhere from $.50 and higher. My issue is  we're already paying and annual fee. Why the need to gouge the prices to get even more money? It's definitely NOT going to the shoppers. I am a senior on a fixed income, so paying extra for items that are originally priced less is disconcerting to say the least. I cancelled my membership after being made aware of this.Date of experience: July 25, 2024MJMarcus Jackson1 reviewUSSep 6, 2024Worst company everWorst company ever. Shoppers are unreliable.

Nov 5th came and so did the “delivery failure” emails for NO reason, it repeated until Nov 10 they faked delivered but all the driver did was take a picture of MY package label ZOOMED in only showing a couple boxes in the background, this was NOT my front door.

Attempted to have my order shipped to a private mailbox. Standard hours of operation is 9 AM to 7 PM. Business hours are super reasonable. SpeedX has attempted to deliver my package after business hours or before! Even after notifying them the hours of operation. I don’t understand why a package is out for delivery at 5:30 AM in the morning and doesn’t get attempted to be delivered until 11pm at night. Makes no sense! 2nd time 11pm, 3rd time 8am, 4th time is still out for jury today. But extremely dissatisfied. I’ve reached out to Speedx several times reiterating the business hours.

But, somehow managed to put my package on the floor in front of my door; took some pictures, and left with it (Because I didn't see ANYTHING the same day they texted me) . I think they stole my items due to the fact they posted 2 differents delivery dates on Shein; while texting me on a different date.

I'm not sure what sales pitch SpeedX is feeding these companies but the company I made my purchase from had no ideal about the awful reviews this company had received until I notified them and requested that my carrier be changed are they would loose me, my family and friends as customers. Up on doing their own research, which took less than 15 mins, of SpeedX they came right back without hesitation and told me they had seen it (the reviews) and would be changing my carrier. The only way to stop these scam of a company is to hit the pockets of the companies that use them.

I will not be buying from Shein until they stop using Speedx or I go back to mainland. If they would correct a few things about this delivery service it would be so much more helpful. Like letting us contact the person delivering the package and letting us leave reviews for those people also. This is just insane that these companies do not see the problem with using Speedx. Avoid it at all costs. Also, they should not serve gated communities if they have no access to them period. Date of experience: October 23, 2024Daniela Dias1 reviewUSOct 25, 2024THE WORST EXPERIENCE NEVER EVER allow your seller to send your packages through this company. A few weeks ago I bought some items that were sent by this company, THE WORST, I tried to track them and always They reported a problem, I tried to fix it but they only have a stupid virtual agent that won't help you in the least, I sent a thousand emails and they never answered. In the end I applied to get my money back But the mfs had already sent the seller that my package had already \"been delivered\" so they didn't give me my money back, definitely a disgusting company, total fraud.Date of experience: October 25, 2024SSSue Su2 reviewsCAOct 18, 2024unprofessional shipping carrier My shipping address is a business address, opening weekday 9am-5pm. My package was delivered first time at 7:40pm while the premises closed. I sent an email to the carrier SPX but no response. No phone number provided, thus I was not able to get hold of the shipping carrier. 3 days after on Saturday the parcel delivery guy left the package at door in the evening 8pm, where is on the street! It’s obvious to anyone a package is likely to be taken by a passerby but the delivery guy still did that. I have to conclude that the staff of SPX are not responsible, or they did not receive professional training.

I look forward to when this company is erase from the Earth.Date of experience: October 09, 2024NANate1 reviewUSOct 24, 2024Scam delivery companyScam delivery company. No customer service AT ALL. Online chat does not ever give you a real person and the phone number just directs you to use the online chat. How is it possible that you take a picture of the package outside and by the time I get to the front door it is already gone? SHEIN is refusing to refund because a picture was taken. I can only assume they are complacent in the criminal activity taking place with this company stealing orders. I now have a camera placed so if they ever do this again I will have it on video and they will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.Date of experience: October 20, 2024Brittany McPartland1 reviewUSOct 24, 2024I wish I could give this company less…I wish I could give this company less than One star.

No success. what an awful companyDate of experience: October 18, 2024DLDluvbaby1 reviewUSOct 15, 2024This company does not deliver packages.This company does not deliver packages to apartment buildings that have a package room.  The driver arrives at 6AM and marks the tracking information as No Access, package undeliverable.  They do not contact you via text, phone call or email and just leave.  They do not let you come to the warehouse to pickup the package.  They do not have a customer service telephone number.

Today is 10/22.  There is no way to contact anyone.  This company is complete TRASH!

Driver didn’t ask for any ID took a picture and left . Now the merchant doesn’t want to refund cause the package was delivered .. Just like all the other reviews, you can’t get a hold of anyone on the phone or a response via email.. This is nothing but a complete scam of a company . They found a way to legally steal peoples packages. Pretty much . Date of experience: October 14, 2024M B1 reviewUSOct 26, 2024Bunch of liars. This company lies a lot. All the reviews here are not wrong. My Shein package was out for delivery at 8am in morning, there was no contact or anything in entire day and at 11:59pm they changed the status to \"Unable to delivery due to incorrect address or them not being able to contact me\". First of all no one attempts to deliver at 11:59pm and no one contacted me either.For last 2 years, I had stopped ordering anything via Shein just because of SpeedX. Recently I had to order some gift bags which was only available on Shein so I ordered via them and it arrived on time via USPS. I thought they must have got rid of SpeedX, so I ordered few more items, but I was wrong. Shein is also supporting them and asking us customers to keep waiting and eventually if it doesn't get delivered they provide the refund. But I needed the items, that's why I ordered it. No more Shein for me. Am sure Shein is losing customers because of SpeedX.Date of experience: October 25, 2024DEDes1 reviewUSOct 28, 2024Never got my packageNever got my package, and poor customer service.

Unethical marketing; kept personal info - unable to deleteI was exploring possibly using them to file my DBA, and then decided not to, once the full fees showed up I did not feel their pricing was the best, so I stopped and did not complete the process. They KEPT all my personal email, sent me repeated spammy emails to \"complete my order,\" with no unsubscribe links. When I contacted them to delete my information as I was unable to do so, they told me I had placed an order. After multiple calls, they did confirm I NEVER placed an order, and then put me old hold repeatedly trying to \"see\" if they could delete my information. HORRIBLE SERVICE.

Everything has been fixed and taken care of and I very much appreciate it. Highly recommend.Date of experience: October 30, 2024Reply from Swyft FilingsNov 1, 2024Hi there,Thank you for reaching out to us. We appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns. We notice that during the checkout process, you opted for our registered agent services for your business. While we do offer filing services for business owners, the selection of a registered agent is ultimately at the discretion of our clients. It is a state requirement to have a registered agent during the application process and throughout the existence of the business.There are two options when choosing a registered agent: 1. **Continue with Swyft Filings** - This indicates that you would like us to be your registered agent.2. **I’ll appoint a different registered agent** - This allows you to select someone else.Since you selected \"Continue with Swyft Filings,\" our services have been added, and we have submitted the necessary information to the Secretary of State. As this is a rendered service, the payment has been initiated.We noticed that the charge for our services has been disputed, and as a result, we have started the process of resigning as your registered agent. Unfortunately, your portal has been temporarily blocked due to the chargeback.However, we want to assist you in resolving this matter. A supervisor will contact you shortly to discuss your options and help find a resolution.Thank you for your understanding.MAMatthew1 reviewUS5 days agoVerifiedSusanna was helpful and responsiveSusanna was helpful and responsive.

Just happened to be apart of my process in getting my business legitimized. Across the board, each person I spoke with had so much patience, understanding, appreciation, and courtesy for me. This is my first go around starting a non profit and I must say the process can be very intimidating but this team's people are truly created for helping people. The slowly walked me through, encouraged me to ask questions and even when i was double charged for fees, they were MORE than willing to help me to get everything corrected! As I said, this is my first time doing this so I cant compare to any other companies providing the same services but SWYFT FILINGS set the bar for me! I will choose them for every business endeavor! Thank you so so much again for helping me to make my dreams come true!

Date of experience: June 20, 2024EBEric B1 reviewUSApr 10, 2024VerifiedSurprisingly good customer service? What?Not normally one to write reviews, but will do so here as this was just an instance of abnormally high quality customer service. Story goes: Called in about a secretary of state compliance issue that was brought to my attention from one of our vendors. Upon calling, was transferred within ~60 seconds to an actual person rather than a machine. Got ahold of Jodin, who was absolutely fantastic. Basically right off the bat, they were well aware of the compliance requirements, were able to assist me with figuring out where the hiccup occurred, proposed what would have likely caused the issue (which I confirmed was spot on following the call!), confirmed that we were in good standing in regards to the issue, then gave a quick rundown on the processes they undertake to avoid any hiccups on our companies end.All of this happened in about 6 or 7 minutes from dialing the number to ending the call. I don't think I've ever had a customer service interaction that was resolved so thoroughly, let alone one in such a short period of time. Props to swyft filings on this one, an issue I thought I'd be working on solving throughout an afternoon took less time than making coffee.

When we notified them of overbilling us, they claimed that we \"approved\" a 4x increase which we did not.  Then when we complained about this increase and disputed their claim, they immediately shut down our account and resigned as our agent without notifying us until after they resigned which has resulted in many more months of paperwork and additional expense than should have been necessary to complete the process of transfer.  Date of experience: September 26, 2024Reply from Swyft FilingsSep 27, 2024Hi there,Thank you for sharing your feedback. We understand your concerns and apologize for any confusion regarding the registered agent service fee adjustment. We sent a notice to inform all customers about the price change, and we're sorry if this was missed. As the billing adjustment occurred four years ago, we were unable to process a refund for the earlier period.Regarding the account closure, it was initiated following a discussion around a potential credit card dispute. At that time, our representative outlined the next steps, which included a refund for the last six months of billing, followed by the account block and resignation as the registered agent.If you would like further clarification or wish to speak with a supervisor, we’d be happy to arrange a call. Please let us know, and we can contact you using the phone number on file.CUcustomer1 reviewUSSep 27, 2024VerifiedTara was awesome and helpfulTara was awesome and helpful. She put my mind at ease.

They have texted me no fewer than 46 times in the past two months, and have never delivered a single box from Factor. They've messed up my address countless times and don't seem to have any communication with the businesses they are hired by. From having zero awareness of zip codes as a shipping company to claiming that areas are \"outside of a service area\" to claiming that boxes have been \"damaged in transit\" for weeks in a row to promising that it will arrive the next day, Veho is about as incompetent and dishonest as it gets. Avoid at all costs, and avoid any company that uses them. Date of experience: November 11, 2024Ian Carroll3 reviewsUSOct 27, 2024Stolen PackagesStolen Packages, And No help from veho themselves.

They were supposed to deliver today and had my cell to call me or text me. I stayed home all afternoon. 7 minutes after the delivery window closed I get an email from Saks that my package had arrived. I ran downstairs and there was NO package in sight. I texted them and they sent a grainy picture of part of my building's outside not even the door and certainly not the interior vestibule. The driver claims he handed the package to a person but has no description and no name and no picture proof that it was delivered. They stopped answering my texts when I asked for accountability and called them out on the lies. I will be filing a theft report with my local police department and have contacted Saks.Date of experience: September 24, 2024Sydney Thompson1 reviewUSSep 17, 2024this delivery company SUCKS this delivery company SUCKS they constantly ignore my delivery instructions, dont message me about when the deliveries are made like theyre supposed to, they leave my meals in the wrong locations such as at the wrong apartment or outside in the heat and dont tell me so things go bad before i figure out where my package is, and they just gaslight you via text that things are updated or fixed and someone will actually listen to the delivery instructions, and then they never do. Not to mention theyre a text only service?? So you can’t call anyone or speak to a real person about anything. I love the home chef meals, but veho delivery system actually f***ing sucks.Date of experience: September 17, 2024Marian G.2 reviewsUSAug 15, 2024Another stolen packageVehu driver left my box at the door at 1:41 pm, and another guy picked up (stole) my box at 1:43 pm, while face timing with the first guy.  All clearly caught and time stamped with my front door camera.  OBVIOUS COLLUSION, possibly to resell the goods in a third party website.  Seems to be a common occurrence with this shipping company, maybe they don’t do background checks and have nothing but crooks working for them.Date of experience: August 09, 2024ARAH Rose2 reviewsUSSep 6, 2024The absolute worstI was contacted by Veho to provide any additional instructions for delivery.  Our driveway had just been re-paved.  There are barriers and signs up NOT to go on the driveway as it was not yet dry.  I sent very specific instructions for the driver to text or call me so I could meet him in the street for the delivery.  I was told that would happen.  Next thing I know I have my package sitting on my front step.  Are the drivers illiterate AND blind? Or they clearly just don't care. This company should be put out of business and sued. Date of experience: September 06, 2024HEHeather2 reviewsUSJul 18, 2024Delivery instructions given with…Delivery instructions given with picture of where to leave package and confirmation text received.

It's covered. All our deliveries are placed there. Veho driver goes past six houses, turns into alleyway and leaves it on a post of our courtyard which has no coverage. Called Nespresso and they have sent me a free $100 order of coffee. This is no way to run a business.Date of experience: August 29, 2024Nicole Malia2 reviewsUSSep 3, 2024Horrible Shipping Service This company is awful. I have no idea why anyone would use them. I’ve spent days of them “attempting” to deliver my package and them sending it back to the warehouse claiming they can’t find the address or they don’t have a gate code (no gate code is needed). The customer service is awful. I can’t get anyone on the phone and I feel like I’m in some alternate universe with how difficult they are making something that literally every other delivery company has been able to accomplish quite easily. I never pay attention to what shipping company is used when making purchases but will certainly make sure to not buy from anyone in the future if they use Veho for deliveries.Date of experience: September 02, 2024WAWAS7 reviewsUSJun 29, 2024ShipVEHO nightmare deliveryMy experience with this delivery service is everything  stated in the other 1-Star reviews.  I wish I could give them a flat zero as well. They sent me so many text messages regarding my address only to send one telling me they could not find the address hence they could not deliver.  I purchased an item from Tory Burch (not the first time.)  other purchases have been delivered by other service providers.  This has become a whole nightmare. SMH. The real name of this delivery service is shipVEHO.Date of experience: June 29, 2024JAJade1 reviewUSAug 29, 20242nd non-deliverySecond time in 3 weeks Veho did not deliver my Cook Unity. This time the photo of the delivery was obviously the back of some random car. When I chatted with customer service I let them know I had video footage and no delivery was made. They then indicated they found out it had been delivered across town at least 30 minutes away...but nothing like my street address and number. Then after they apologised I went back into the chat and all their chat communications had disappeared except to say they took full responsibility but it was the merchants responsibility to provide a refund. Either the driver was incompetent or dishonest, and the person responding to my chats (of which I had already forwarded on to Cook Unity) deleted their texts so it seems dishonest to me. Also, the photo of the delivery disappeared too. It all seems very shady to me and I plan to cancel Cook Unity deliveries because of the issues. Date of experience: August 28, 2024HEHeidi5 reviewsUSJun 7, 2024Major Theft! Several times my packages have been \"lost in transit\" with Veho and it's a little suspicious that only Veho can't seem to deliver orders.  They're likely stealing and selling or keeping the items for themselves while the manufacturers have to pay out the customers for lost packages.  It's a known scam so stay away from Veho!!Date of experience: June 03, 2024Sheryl Lynn1 reviewUSJun 16, 2024Very UNtrustworthy,I ordered coffee from Nespresso and was supposedly delivered via Veho.

After reading all the reviews on Trustpilot, I really don’t need to say anything more  because everything has been said. I don’t know why any company would use them at all.  they are absolutely horrific. I have gotten more refunds from my food delivery company for orders that I didn’t receive or that were delivered to the wrong address or delivered so late that the food was spoiled. There has to be another viable option.

They sent my package to the wrong location, the picture of the entrance they showed me via customer support didn’t even look like an entrance, it looks like the back of a mechanical area of an apartment building. Even after customer support said that the driver made a mistake, they proceeded to not do anything about the mistake. Essentially saying it is out of our control when they’re the ones that made the mistake and are refusing to correct it. All major store companies, specifically Zara, do NOT use this service for deliveries. What kind of delivery driver thinks a mechanical room is a place to deliver a package. Unacceptable. Date of experience: June 24, 2024susan masterson1 reviewUSJul 17, 2024Amazing Meals!These meals are amazing! My husband and I have never been disappointed. Whomever they have in charge as the chef, kudos to them.

Medical issues have gotten in the way of my ability to prepare meals every night. This has been a godsend. Date of experience: July 16, 2024HAHannah2 reviewsUSJun 22, 2024If you want your packages delivered to your entire neighborhood, go with this company!Package was delivered to my neighborhood gate. Not my house, or my mailbox. Never in my 16+ years of living here has that ever happened. Unsurprisingly, my package was no longer there when I went to get it. Delivering it to the gate was absolutely asking for it to get stolen. I’ve never heard of this company until today, and I can see why.Date of experience: June 21, 2024George Ishtar2 reviewsILDec 15, 2023Lost package, no service at all.A company is assessed on their ability to provide service when things go wrong. Veho has no such ability, and it is done intentionally. The lack of service probably saves them money and allows them to provide cheap shipping. Sellers that use them provide bad customer experience. If you are a shipping company, you should allow people to contact you. Veho provides minimal communication options and NEVER bother to answer. on the tracking info for our package they told us to contact them with the provided case number. we contacted them multiple times. no reply at all. They lost the package, and they don't care about it.Date of experience: December 15, 2023ANanonymous1 reviewUSFeb 28, 2024why isn't zero stars an option?why isn't zero stars an option?veho \"delivered\" my package at 5am and returned to factory because \"no one was home.\" i contacted their INFURATING customer service which knew nothing- literally. couldn't tell me why i wasn't notified of the odd delivery time, why they needed someone to answer the door for delivery, when they would attempt redelivery... so what do you do as a shipping company then? frankly i told sephora that if they send me a package with veho again i'll stop shopping there- yeah, it's that bad.Date of experience: February 28, 2024BBBrandon Bergstrom2 reviewsUSOct 11, 2023No consistency or customer serviceVeho does not have any consistency in their delivery process. My recent package was returned to the warehouse without any notification to me due to “being too far off route.” Customer service is only available over text and is not willing to help in any way. Avoid using them unless you want frustrations and spoiled food.Date of experience: October 09, 2023Kendall Lobo1 reviewUSDec 4, 2023Delivery driver stole my packageThis isn’t even a real company, they only have a phone number to text but you can’t call it. Package from Saks fifth Avenue was out for delivery then later that day was marked “lost in transit” and is now “under investigation”. Extremely sketchy and sh***y company.Date of experience: December 04, 2023LTLeslie T1 reviewUSNov 16, 2022The worst of all delivery servicesThe worst of all delivery services. Used them for meal delivery. Box is packed  Sunday and not delivered until Tuesday late night. Other times package arrives on its side or box is crushed. Absolutely terrible. Going to local cooking services as other companies are moving to Veho as their delivery service. What a disaster these guys are.Date of experience: November 16, 2022LFLindsey Fuller1 reviewUSOct 9, 2023Can't follow instructionsThey were responsible for delivery my Hello Fresh meals every week. I would repeatedly put in the instructions NOT to drop the box off at my garage or near my garage but to place the box on my front porch where my dog couldn't eat the box. Every other week, like clockwork they were dropping the box off at my garage and sending me a picture of it. When I'd give a 1 rating they'd say \"we added more specific directions regarding your instructions\" but guess what same thing would happen again and again. It's an automated message and nothing actually gets fixed. Don't buy items from a company that uses this delivery service!!! This company sucks and can't follow simple instructions.Date of experience: October 09, 2023Annie1 reviewUSUpdated May 14, 2024Use another delivery companyDriver left package outside and the package was stolen. I was at home waiting for this package but apparently ringing the doorbell was too difficult for this delivery person. I could have left delivery instructions on how to ring the doorbell but that wasn't an option on their very stupid website. I would recommend staying far away from this delivery company.Date of experience: April 28, 2024ZVZuzana V.7 reviewsGBDec 6, 2022Terrible service, no support, no tracking, no redeliveryTerrible service, impossible to track packages until are delivered, no re-deliveries, if you are not home they will leave outside (they say) or take it as a donation. No communication other than text, and very rarely do they reply. Just see for yourself, no support, no tracking. By far the worst \"service\" ever created.Date of experience: December 04, 2022CLClaire2 reviewsUSApr 7, 2023ScamScam! Complete garbage company. Can’t believe big retailers like Saks Fifth Avenue are using them. The only way to communicate with Veho is via AI bots. They can’t even form proper sentences or use the correct words. This company will not be around long. Avoid at all costsDate of experience: April 05, 2023KOKop1 reviewUSOct 13, 2023Warning!!Warning!!!  Package was delivered torn wide open.

Never again.Date of experience: October 13, 2023Rewa Brown1 reviewUSJun 16, 2023Not a reliable delivery companyIt seems to be just independent contractor drivers who can choose to deliver or not to deliver. It was great for years but now they just don’t deliver and report the problem is the address. But it’s not gated, not rural, no dogs. And nothing has changed except now they can’t deliver but no reason is givenDate of experience: June 15, 2023MIMike3 reviewsUSJun 24, 2023Terrible company to work for ~ SCAM ARTISTSTerrible company to work for. Be aware of the following. They will package less desirable/unsafe routes in with 1 STOP of a desirable location, so that you choose it thinking you're in a good/safe area but it will be only 1 stop. The other ones will be in inner cities, buildings that have police booths outside thats how bad they are. They will not compensate you for their mistake if the app directs you to the wrong address. They do not cover tolls (and almost all routes in tri-state area will have tolls). Customer service is terrible.Date of experience: June 24, 2023Kaylan Martin1 reviewUSJan 27, 2024HorribleHorrible! Delivery driver had no regard for my package and placed it in front of the leasing office…at night despite my unit number being on the shipping label.

I’m not even going to bother explaining my experience and how disastrous they are, I just came here because people need to know how bad this Veho service is. Honestly, they should be out of business. I’m giving 1 star because zero is not possible!Date of experience: November 27, 2023Nona L2 reviewsUSJun 17, 2023THE ABSOLUTE WORST!This is the worst shipping experience I've ever had. The driver texted a picture delivery confirmation of a location I didn't recognize... Btw, I was only able to respond and communicate with Veho via text. Customer serviceclaimed the driver returned to the location to retrieve package, less than an hour later, but it was gone. This was after they asked me to try to retrieve it myself. Then provided me an address to a church around the corner so the driver obviously lied about where he actually took the package. Customer service was very unbothered...texting without having the courtesy to call me. Eventually they told me the package is gone, there's nothing they can do and I need to contact Saks directly regarding credit. Despicable!Date of experience: June 17, 2023OmiePlumey5 reviewsUSAug 17, 2022Terrible companyTerrible company. Constantly underpaying drivers and, on many occasions, removing drivers from the platform without proper communication. Advertises jobs in markets that have not been open.

A zero would be too kind. I had a time sensitive delivery, the driver was not able to get into the community because they did use the call box I did get my item. Even worse they are a text based company so you are able to call and talk to anyone. Worst experience ever. I understand this his a new company. I suggest going back to drawing board because you guys SUCK! Date of experience: May 30, 2024PBPam Bilfeld2 reviewsUSJun 14, 2023DO NOT USE VEHO DELIVERY WHEN ORDERING FROM SAKS FIFTH AVENUEI placed an order online from Saks Fifth Avenue for an expensive designer blazer. I live in a doorman apartment building and as always, I asked for it to be shipped with signature required.  Veho sent a text that my package was delivered with a “pic of the box at the front door to my apartment”. Apartment number was correct BUT WRONG BUILDING! I contacted Veho and they write back after investing, that they indeed delivered my package to the wrong building and they are no longer able to retrieve it. They assumed ZERO responsibility!!!Date of experience: June 13, 2023MPMP4 reviewsUSMar 5, 2024Of course company lost my packageOf course company lost my package.

Date of experience: March 12, 2024Tim Platson1 reviewUSNov 1, 2022The most incompetent delivery service and drivers imaginable.They misdelivered or straight up lost 6 of my last 8 deliveries from Home Chef.  Their drivers don’t speak any English here in the Austin area, which means if they call with trouble if you don’t speak Spanish you’re out of luck.  They are lazy, and when they don’t feel like working anymore they just return all the rest of the deliveries to the warehouse.  Their customer service people told me that directly, it’s not an assumption on my part.  I was going to cancel HomeChef, until they told me Veho only delivers Mondays and Tuesdays, so I moved to Wednesday and now FedEx is delivering in the future.  If Veho is the only shipping option anywhere you shop, I’d go elsewhere.Date of experience: October 30, 2022Tara1 reviewUSApr 1, 2024Incompetent or thieves? I had three packages set to be delivered by Veho. They marked all three as delivered, but you can clearly see in the picture the delivery driver took that only two packages were dropped off. Customer service said that they “can’t reach the driver” and to contact Saks for a refund. I don’t want a refund- I want my order!!! The shoes that I ordered are now sold out, so I guess I just won’t be getting them at all. Veho has so many other bad reviews- do not use this company! Date of experience: April 01, 2024Patricia La2 reviewsUSMay 3, 2023Very unreliable delivery serviceVery unreliable delivery service. Their driver never delivered the package.

Delivered my package to the wrong address (a business address) at 9pm at night.  Threw the boxes out in the middle of their parking lot (didn't even have the decency to place them under a covered area.)

Lately, both Zara and Lululemon are apparently using this company for shipping. They have made zero attempt to deliver to the full address multiple times leaving my package outside the building after hours and my packages have been stolen multiple times. Terrible service. I can’t believe big retailers are using this service. I am sure it’s a matter before relationships sour retailers because this is completely unacceptable and irresponsible.Date of experience: August 20, 2023DMDM1 reviewUSJan 15, 2022Zero StarsIf I could give a 0, I would. Unfortunately, HelloFresh has them contracted for deliveries in my area. The first delivery I was supposed to receive from them never showed up. So detailed instructions were added to my orders. Consistently, some of the drivers ignore the instructions and I’m bombarded with texts and phone calls from them because of it. I hope moving away from this area in the future also gets me away from dealing with this carrier service.Date of experience: January 15, 2022Admin Email1 reviewUSMay 17, 2023Absolutely the worstAbsolutely the worst.  For four days, I asked, via text, about my package.  Throughout each day,  I received text messages saying the package from vitacost would be delivered.  Each day, there were a series of excuses and empty assurances.  To date, the package still has not been received.   I have been a vitacost customer for years.  I will no longer order from vitacost if Veho will be used for deliveries.  It is absolutely inexcusable.  Nothing but a waste of time trying to get what I paid for delivered to me.Date of experience: May 16, 2023KAKathy2 reviewsUSNov 25, 2023The delivery driver stole our packageThe delivery driver stole our package.

I couldn’t care less if he could or could not delivery on time. I just the fact the lazy bum is getting paid to pretend he can’t deliver to a building that is open from 7 am to 6pm. He told me that at 11 am. It is a luxury apartment. There are tons of doors. The front and back door are always open for deliveries and have concierge. But the lazy bum wants to take the one side door that is closed. There’s like 10000 doors there. You can at least talk your lazy ass to the front or back door where it’s for people to go in and out of. Couldn’t believe the lazy bum would lie to me like my building is preventing people from coming in. Got UPS, FedEx, USPS, door dash, uber eats…been at the apartment over a year ain’t never had an issue with any of them until a lazy Veho bum employee does it 😂. Of course a lazy bum would pick a company that let its worker decide if he’s too lazy to go to another door. Bum company and bum ass employees. Thank you fanatics for refunding my shipping and making sure I don’t ever get a delivery from those bums again. Date of experience: August 14, 2024Garrett Bogard1 reviewUSDec 4, 2023Terrible Delivery ServiceI have my Nespresso orders shipped through Veho and I always have issues.  Most of the time the drivers do not read the delivery instructions (I live in an apartment complex with clear guidelines for the call box entry and building) and before they ever even attempt to deliver to my door they say there was an issue with the delivery.  And I only know this because I never receive a call from the call box to grant entry.  Today I also had my package delivered to the main office of my complex but it wasn't even handed to a receptionist and was available for anyone to take if they wanted to.Date of experience: December 04, 2023Pat Banach1 reviewUSDec 19, 2023Failed to deliverMy package was shipped 12/2 with a promised delivery date of 12/6. On 12/18 I realized no delivery so I tracked the package. The said it couldn't be delivered OR it was recalled by the business.  Both not true in my opinion.  I've lived in the same house for 40 years and get packages all the time.

I waited in the front garden on  Friday afternoon  anticipating imminent delivery- according to the tracking map - when notification arrived to say delivery couldn't be made because there was nobody home. It's now Monday, again I'm way down the delivery list numbers, again the van is probably 20 mins away but the time for my delivery has already been put back to 5.30, (it's 1.45 now) so I can't see it arriving again. It's a an anniversary gift for my husband, but at this rate will be in time for next year rather than this weekend. Will cancel the order if it doesn't arrive.

Somehow it takes six days until it shows \"in country\" (what did they do, send it tied to a pigeon?)It's now over 30 days, and the subscription service has billed for the next shipment, yet the previous one still hasn't arrived! Not only that but it hasn't even been handed over to the last mile delivery company Aramex, which is the SECOND worst courier service (after APC Postal Logistics, obviously)!Date of experience: April 05, 2024HCH C Lee4 reviewsSGSep 29, 2023Non-existent Customer Service and Prolong Delivery with no definite delivery date in sightBought a item online and was shipped via APC Logistics.

Each package received to their warehouse has their own label added on top of yours. This has led to orders going to the incorrect address, or worse, never leaving their distribution center. The other issue is the couriers that they use in the UK and Australia. These last mile providers could not give a damn about your package. One buyer told me that Aramex made him go to their office to get his order if he wanted it. When the postage is so low, and fuel and other costs have risen, it makes you wonder how much motivation they have. Best to use a service that employs the national postal service.Date of experience: February 08, 2023DADaniel3 reviewsCAJul 28, 2023Amateur hour in the shipping businessAmateur hour in the shipping business. I've waited nearly a month for a package from Amazon that was handed off to this company for delivery. There has been one tracking entry made during that entire time indicating when APC received it. I've since sent two emails to APC looking for updates, but neither prompted a response. I can understand if external factors impact the way a company operates (when that is the case), but a failure to communicate with customers is unacceptable. I recommend not to purchase from any retailer that uses this company to ship their goods.Date of experience: July 26, 2023BOBobo1 reviewAUSep 23, 2022Incompetence cannot be used as an…Incompetence cannot be used as an excuse for these clowns.

Its been over a monthHate to do this, as I usually only give good reviews. Bought an item from a smaller company Nov 25-26th with a delivery expectancy of 4-21 days (they have been having issues).... It was updated Nov 27th through \"shop\" app and APC. It's Jan 4th, nothing at all. Put an inquiry into the company they said there's been some issues with the contracted shipping company, so I   also put an inquiry into APC around Dec 27th (so i   gave it past the expected delivery date) and NOTHING. I   truly hope my purchaser doesn't use this shipping company again. In the previous years they take quite some time with ZERO updates until it arrives at your door. I   also could have purchased the item for Boxing Day and paid half of what i    did... thinking it would have been here before Christmas......Date of experience: November 27, 2023SGShannon Gower3 reviewsGBOct 15, 2021Can't really say anything about their…Can't really say anything about their service because I am yet to receive my parcel.

Most recently, I placed an order with a company on Nov 9 and they had it shipped next day. I contacted the company on Nov 27 regarding the shipping status, as it had not been updated on the APC site. The company was great and sent a replacement order free of charge on Nov 28, but they again used APC for shipping. I finally received the original order on Dec 8, and still waiting on the replacement order, which tracking still hasn't been updated on APC site even today (Dec 31), a month after the company shipped it.

I've had packages from Chico CA sit in NJ, or ELK Gr Sacramento CA, for TWO WEEKS not moving. What is wrong with this company. Don't you care at all about your customer base? FOUR to FIVE WEEKS for a small package to Australia is very poor service. Unfortunately I've had this issue multiple times as the Online Store I deal with use Apc.

With APC however, not a thing has happened. At this rate I won't see my packages for months. They haven't even processed them.

I paid for \"priority\" shipping (at quite a vast expense) and it's a week past its lastest expectant delivery. I get that delays may happen with the whole COVID-19 thing, but it's the fact that my tracking hasn't updated in over a week. It's left at \"in transit\" so It seems like my parcel may have been lost. If delays are happening because of COVID-19 I would at least appreciate an update from APC and they really shouldn't offer priority shipping if they can't deliver on it right now.Very disappointed with the service. I hope my parcel isn't lost because I've only seen bad things about their so-called \"customer service\". Avoid companies who ship with APC if you can unless you want to risk your parcel getting lost or taking months past the expected delivery date.Date of experience: May 12, 2020Reply from Apc PliMay 12, 2020Good day,I'm sorry that you have yet to receive your parcel.

It’s 7th June & no update on tracking since 20th May.Tweeted and eventually got a response asking for me tracking number…6 days later no follow up. Emailed numerous times and no response. This package is a donation to help fundraise at Given To Live. Post pandemic funds are at a premium so this delay (or has it been stolen by a member of staff, hence avoiding communication?) is keenly felt.Absolute disgrace.

Suffice to say, I'm switching back to Canada Post because even without tracking, at least they export the packages out of the country quickly. I've had multiple overseas packages sit in APC's US warehouse for weeks without moving. I had an order delivered to the completely wrong address on the other side of town, I know this because the delivery person added GPS delivery location of the WRONG ADDRESS. This company is beyond incompetent, and I advise any small business to not use them, however appealing their prices and delivery times might be.Date of experience: January 08, 2023ALAli1 reviewINUpdated Aug 18, 2020APC lost my packageOrdered from the weeknd store around May 1st.

My package DID arrive after 15 business days. BUT, their online tracking SUCKS. It never moves from the day a vendor drops off a package till it is delivered. My package tracking still shows it at 'Information Received' which is the first stage, even though I received my package last week, which is 5 stages not updated. Heck, even my vendor's order page still shows my package is 'on the way'. Incompetent and IDGAF attitude. Date of experience: October 30, 2024AdvertisementSanne Van Put1 reviewBE5 days agoI ordered a package in the UKI ordered a package in the UK. The tracking says it was delivered the 30th of October. I was on holiday till the 4th of November... No package to be found. Contacted all my neighbour's, nothing to be seen. I sent an email to colisprive: they just answered that the package is nowhere to be found on their part and that I have to contact ASENDIA UK DOM BE. No information whatsoever, no phone number, no email. Definitely not happy with them!! Date of experience: November 08, 2024ANAndrew3 reviewsGBUpdated Nov 1, 2024Fails to respond to sender or receiver…Fails to respond to sender or receiver when there is a problem. Package is stuck due to insufficient address information, and we need Asendia to instruct the delivery partner. No replies via the online contact form, and no telephone number to call.Update: tried the telephone number 0845 873 8155. Only option is to leave a message because selecting the option to speak to an operator sends you back to leaving a message. It's an 0845 number, so the call is at my expense. Had no response after leaving a message. If someone from Asendia is reading this, please reach out to try and resolve.Update #2: Had an e-mail reply, but was told the matter was for the UK delivery partner. Yet the UK delivery partner tell me it is a matter for the sending postal authority. I am stuck, and my parcel is going round in circles, and looks likely to be exported back out of the UK a second time.Date of experience: October 31, 2024LÁLászló1 reviewHUOct 22, 2024Relatively fast, but very poor tracking experience (e-PAQ Select DDP)Waiting for shipping and actual shipping was okay (couple days of wait before actual shipping) and customs handling was fast too.But the tracking is rather bad.

Still here, almost four weeks later without my package. Summary: Non-existent customer service and they probably ship their packages on donkeys because they are just SO SLOW.They don't reply when you try to contact them regarding packages. They're extremely slow, it's been two weeks since my package ARRIVED in Sweden and it took them 7 days just to handle the package after arrival from FINLAND... I've received packages from Canada and the US that have taken less time door-to-door.

The tracking shows that it was handed to Asendia on August 27th, 2024 in Singapore, and has not moved or been updated since then. Neither the seller nor I have had any response from Asendia. I have sent four different contact forms to Asendia and no one has returned that contact. I also have not been able to get through by phone or by email address.Tracking Number: LS476916138CHAsendia Tracking ID: ASSG20002551096421Genuinely disappointed in the service and Asendia's lack of response. I caution anyone planning to use their service against it - especially after seeing all the copy and paste replies to reviews here. Even when you follow their advice and contact using the form, you do not hear back.Date of experience: October 23, 2024Reply from AsendiaOct 29, 2024Hi Donya, Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention, and I sincerely apologize for the frustration you’ve experienced with your package. After reviewing your tracking information, I regret to inform you that your shipment is unfortunately confirmed as lost in transit.I understand how disappointing this is, especially after waiting for such a long time. It is unacceptable that you have not received a response from our team despite your multiple attempts to contact us. We are actively working to improve our response times.For the next steps, I recommend reaching out to the retailer directly regarding a refund, as they will be able to assist you with that process.We truly appreciate your patience and understanding during this challenging time.Quokka Wife1 reviewGBOct 24, 2024No update for 2+ monthsThere has been no update to my tracking since 27th August. Between 23rd September and 24th October I submitted 4 support requests and messaged them on Instagram and have no response whatsoever. Their customer service is non-existent and the fact that there is no way to contact them apart from relying on a support request form (that no one seems to respond to) does not sit well with me. There is no option to submit a complaint, though even if there was it would probably be another form they choose to ignore. It is very unfortunate that the sender could only use Asendia and I will most definitely not use them ever again, as well as advising everyone I know that Asendia are unreliable.

The parcel was shipped and received (not just \"information received\", actual acceptance of the parcel) by Asendia on September 26. It is shown as having left Sweden on the 4th of October, but it had not left. As of the 16th there was no update in the system. The vendor had to reach out to Asendia, who did not respond to her, but suddenly the parcel left Sweden (again?) and took three further days to make it to Ireland and be handed over to the Irish post. I could have walked the parcel to Ireland from Finland in the time it took Asendia to ship the \"express\" parcel. Bad form, Asendia. I guess we'll see whether the parcel has been tampered with when it arrives tomorrow.Edit: In response to the offer of contact below - I contacted your customer service on the day of the original review and was promised a response that has yet to be given. The merchant I purchased from is fed up with you and vows not to use you again.

RKRoger King52 reviewsGBSep 30, 2024Useless, and clearly don't care...Asienda have been 'managing' a shipment from the US to the UK, a small package bought via ebay, for nearly a month now.Their tracking is abysmal, and it's currently in Switzerland for some reason.

DISHONEST , act like criminals!!!!My reply to Asendia’s comments:Asendia’s comments are absolutely beside the point and total nonsense. Their service and business model are beyond belief the worst I have ever experienced. My recommendation is to stay away from Asendia.

Aber ich habe auch noch nie mit einer derart inkompetenten Firma zu tun gehabt! Ich habe bei Temu etwas aus China bestellt, alles bezahlt, und laut E-Mail ist von deren Seite aus alles gut gelaufen. Nun ja, auf einmal bekomme ich am 21.10.2024 eine Mail von Temu: \"Herzlichen Glückwunsch, Ihre Bestellung ist in der Schweiz. Klicken Sie auf Tracking, um sie zu verfolgen.\" Gesagt, getan! Als ich das tat, landete ich auf einer Website von Asendia. Dort steht bei der Bestellinfo: \"Retourniert – nicht abgeholte Sendung.\" Aber es war immer noch der gleiche Tag, der 21.10.2024!Diese reudige, inkompetente Drecksfirma hat mir weder eine Info gegeben, dass ich etwas abholen sollte, noch sonst irgendetwas! Außerdem, wofür bestellt man nach Hause, wenn dann so eine rotzfreche Firma daherkommt und verlangt, dass man seine bezahlte Ware abholt! Die haben doch nicht mehr alle Tassen im Schrank... Fazit: Jetzt habe ich einen halben Monat auf bezahlte Ware gewartet – für nichts! Die Produkte wurden um die halbe Welt geschickt, und das nur wegen so einem nutzlosen Betrieb wie Asendia!Außerdem kann man diese Firma weder über die 0800-Nummer, die nicht funktioniert, noch per E-Mail kontaktieren. Laut anderen Bewertungen erhält man auf E-Mails keine Antwort. Ich habe trotzdem eine geschrieben. Aber warum, zum Teufel, gibt man eine Kontakt-Nummer an, die nicht funktioniert? Das sagt doch schon alles über diese Firma aus!I’ve never really been the kind of person who writes reviews. But I’ve also never dealt with such an incompetent company before! I ordered something from China through Temu, paid for everything, and according to an email from them, everything went smoothly. Well, suddenly on 21.10.2024, I receive an email from Temu: \"Congratulations, your order is in Switzerland. Click on tracking to follow it.\" Said and done! When I did that, I ended up on a website from Asendia. There, the order info said: \"Returned – unclaimed shipment.\" But it was still the same day, 21.10.2024!This lousy, incompetent company didn’t even give me any information that I needed to pick something up – nothing! Also, why would you order something to your home if some pathetic company like this comes around and expects you to pick up your paid goods! They must be out of their minds… In conclusion, I waited half a month for paid goods – for nothing! The products were shipped halfway around the world, all for nothing because of a useless company like Asendia!Furthermore, you can't contact this company either through the 0800 number, which doesn’t work, or by email. According to other reviews, they don’t respond to emails. I wrote one anyway. But why on earth would they provide a contact number that doesn’t work? That alone says everything about this company!Date of experience: October 21, 2024Reply from AsendiaOct 29, 2024Hello,Thank you for taking the time to share your experience, and I sincerely apologise for the frustration you’ve encountered with your order. I understand how upsetting it can be to receive an unexpected notification about your shipment, especially after waiting for so long.I’m sorry to hear that your package was marked as returned.

It's obvious that helping customers with a issue (i.e. lost package) is not a priority for the company. I've called, left messages, sent e-mails with the same feeling that this was a robot who answered me. If Asendia is not able to offer a decent customer service, they should just stop the business. Seriously.UPDATE : Never got a reply from Aendia even if their robot cried a river in their reply to my comment. Seriously, Asendia nee to propre of proper customer service if they wan to show they are concerned by the quality of the service because right now, it's obivious it is just a matter of time before the company shut down since they offer a awful service.Date of experience: July 28, 2024Reply from AsendiaAug 19, 2024Hi Jean-Philippe,I apologise for any delays in response to your query.

No response to emails or forms submitted online. I will never patronize a company that ships using them again. Update - after receiving the response from Asendia on here I was hopeful and as requested, I filled out the form again (at least the fourth time that I have filled it out) and submitted it. However, still no response from customer service resulted. I am of the opinion that customer service either doesn't exist or just totally ignores customers.  I guess the Commerce Commission will hear from me next as Asendia has truly breached their obligations.  Too bad a one is the worst score possible. It is a lot higher than they deserve. I paid a small fortune for this service and they don't even have the common decency to respond. 20 September - Now more than a month since status changed to arrived in destination country. This company has to be a scam. They won't respond to me or the company that shipped the package.

At Asendia we work very hard to offer a quality service and are thrilled to hear that your experience was so positive.Thank you for contacting Asendia and have a pleasant day.AdvertisementYana Sai1 reviewAUSep 23, 2024Delivery thugs had a very disappointing experience with this delivery service. They provided false tracking updates, claiming delivery attempts were made when no one came to my home. I was present and received other deliveries on those days. This has eroded my trust, and I am left questioning the whereabouts of my parcel. I expect reliable service for the payment I made, and I will be escalating this this issue to the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman and report it to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for further review if it remains unresolved.Date of experience: September 23, 2024Reply from AsendiaOct 1, 2024Hello,On rare occasions parcels can be delayed or misrouted and we are sorry for when this is the case and for any inconvenience caused.We understand that if your delivery is delayed or lost it can be very frustrating, so we apologise for any inconvenience caused and ask that you please visit this web page to view our process for resolving such issues: https://www.asendia.co.uk/shopper-supportThank you for contacting Asendia and have a pleasant day.POpocopoco1 reviewSGApr 28, 2024Been using them for awhile now because…Been using them for awhile now because not a lot of reasonably priced alternatives in Singapore.Delivery is very slow and if the package is undelivered to recipient you will never get the package returned back to you.

Meanwhile the package tracking says there were two attempts to deliver. Now I'm patiently waiting for the third and final attempt according to your messages.

Without any notice, Flash Box delayed the delivery date to London, Ontario, and after all, it was supposed to come today 16 August between 10 am and 5 pm. It is 5:10 pm. I rechecked FlashBox online now, then they wrote that the delivery has to be between 4 and 8 pm today. The delivery building is a commercial office and the staff should stay here waiting for delivery till 8 pm.For the customer, Flashbox is a lying company or unreliable people who operate the service. I never use FlashBox again. No ethics of this company!Date of experience: August 12, 2024Emil1 reviewCAUpdated Jan 15, 2024Never delivered or repsonseNever delivered - failed promised dates.Used via Leze the Label for clothing purchase for Christmas.  Rec'd confirmation for delivery on the 23rd, then on the 24th, then pushed to the 27..28..29th. No response to \"chat\".  Phone (888.631.7895) constantly rings - no answer.I've got hundreds of dollars in clothing missing & a failed Christmas gift delivery. Not impressed & looking for answers...UPDATE - items rec’d but still no contact from LEZE. Standard comfort clothing available from many stores. Due to customer service, wouldnever purchase from again.Date of experience: December 22, 2023Seven Six1 reviewCAFeb 8, 2024Generic CS responses not addressing concernsI'm amazed that FlashBox has such a high rating. Whenever I am forced to use this company my tracking number magically disappears—every time. As I do every time, I reached out to support who gave me the same response as the last 2 times- the seller didn't send the package to them. Contact the seller. Odd because I watched the package arrive at their sorting facility when my tracking number was functional. The last 2 times they delivered my package after telling me this generic response. Terrible customer service and that isn't to throw the agents under the bus. I don't believe they are equipped to be great by Flashbox.Date of experience: February 07, 2024marlene hunte2 reviewsCAJul 13, 2023Fantastic delivery service …My meds  arrived in a padded envelope that was perfect. Flashbox emailed me when the package was on delivery emailed me when the person arrived so I was waiting for her when she came to the door. No surprises.

My experience was my package was supposed to be delivered to my door to mitigate parcel theft luckily I was home and was able to retrieve it in the elevator lobby before this would’ve happened if I wasn’t. Operating like this reflects poorly on the company and the companies that have partnered with them for the delivery of their sales.

My initials MP it’s not that hard to put an M in a P but the delivery person put a random thing and told the company because I made a complaint about it that I did sign for it which is not true.The company has proof that I did not sign for it because the initials is not what I would put and the guy didn’t even take a proper photo. Clearly he never dropped off any merchandise. He just took pictures far away and that was it. That’s why they’re blurry. I have surveillance cameras he doesn’t even pick up on my front door camera because he was never there that close.When I told the company well obviously, he’s lying because it would make me look bad if he knew what my hair colour was which is pretty rememberable, because he said he passed the package to me, never happened and they didn’t even ask him that they believe the driver who forge my signature, which is against the law!I would not recommend this company at all to anyone! Liars, scammers the drivers are not reliable and they forge your signature and take your package.Date of experience: September 13, 2023JPJohn Pierce1 reviewCAOct 7, 2022Excellent service and so reliableExcellent service and so reliable!

The non-English speaking driver in a beat-up old car sat in front of our house honking the horn until we came out in the rain. He approached waving his phone unable to tell us he wanted a signature for an inexpensive item from Amazon. The GLs delivery driver had no sense of customer service and, it turns out, only wanted the signature to protect himself. It wasn't required.Date of experience: March 05, 2024Josh4 reviewsUSAug 10, 2024Good luck getting your package on timeGood luck getting your package on time, support lies to you if you ask anything about it, it just comes late consistently.

First experience with this service.  Their courier left my package in the middle of the floor in a public lobby of my apartment complex where it was stolen before I even got the notification it was delivered.  Emailing them they told me there was nothing they could do and directed me to the seller, who had nothing at all to do with their negligence. This company sees nothing wrong with a courier just throwing a package onto the floor and taking off, and will do nothing to help after the fact. I advise staying as far away from them as possible as both shipper and receiver.Date of experience: August 13, 2024MHMHV1 reviewUSJul 18, 2024GLS is the worst. Why do distributors ship with them?Small family owned bookstore here, three years of GLS shipping hassle.*GLS shipping has zero customer service.The longest waits to speak with anyone every time, with zero resolution! They can only put in a “request” and no one has EVER gotten back to us even once. *Bad handling of packages. As stated we are a bookstore and GLS constantly delivers our packages damaged. In turn our merchandise is often damaged and as a small family owned buisness we depend on receiving our books in good condition!* GLS no longer delivers on weekends! GLS’s claim to fame is fast next day delivery. Now that they no longer deliver on weekends we often don’t get our packages until the following week. We have other distributors that ship from the area fed-ex and UPS and receive our items within two days.Date of experience: July 18, 2024CDCecilia Delgado4 reviewsUSMay 5, 2024Ordered from ThredUp for the first time…Ordered from ThredUp for the first time in years.

Lived here 5 yrs and never had a package stolen. Look up GLS and see countless reviews with similar experiences. Employees stealing packages? Sheer incompetence?

I was supposed to receive a package on July 10 but what ended up happening is it went up for delivery and never made it to my house I contacted them the next day they said they’ll get it out did not receive it Friday they said oh yeah your package will be delivered and then I get a email saying sorry we’re not delivering your package today. Then they asked me if they can deliver it on Saturday. I said yes and they were supposed to submit a request form on Friday and Monday it was supposed to be out for delivery. Well come to find out. They have lost my package. I ended up having to contact the shipper and telling him about this.

The driver has a mind of a little child. Keep ignoring my rescheduled requests and coming in the morning. I rescheduled it for next day between 4-8pm, he ignored the entire request submitted to their customer support and did not even try to deliver. Customer support said they are not sure why the driver did not come out. Instead day after he again attempted early in the morning. lol what a joke. The driver totally ignores their own customer support requests and misses the point that the customer is not available in the mornings.  The driver just wakes up whenever he like he just quickly attempts to deliver. The sole purpose of GLS drivers is to miss the delivery instead of make the delivery.

Every time something is shipped to me and I see GLS I know instantly I will not recieve it anywhere near the predicted delivery date. I recently ordered from Eightvape. I had previously stopped ordering from them because of GLS. I decided to try again like an idiot. My order left their facility in Las Vegas on 9/4 heading to me in Texas. It went from Vegas to Ontario Canada on 9/6.....a little out of the way to get to Texas! It was supposed to arrive by 9/12. It hasn't moved since 9/6 and is still in Canada. I did live chat with GLS and explained the issue. The customer service rep simply said \"you will have to wait for dispatch to update. Please bare with us! Anything else?\" While typing a response it says \"this chat will now end\" and they were gone. Thanks for all your help GLS!! This will 100% be my last time to order from any company that uses this shipper.

I'm on the 2nd attempt trying to get a delivery from Flaviar of 11 bottles of alcohol (1st delivery simply never showed up even though the shipping details said Out for Delivery for weeks). 2nd attempt once Flaviar cancelled my order and i reordered was supposed to be delivered yesterday. Still says \"Out for Delivery.\" Here we go again. The GLS support people are all COMPLETELY WORTHLESS LIARS. They all gave me the runaround about expediting the shipment and I'd receive it tomorrow all 6 times i called about the 1st shipment. NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER use this company unless you want to completely waste your time and money. I hope the GLS employees are enjoying all 22 bottles of alcohol they likely stole from me between both orders.Date of experience: May 10, 2024MJMichele Johnson2 reviewsUSAug 13, 2023My package was returned to sender due…My package was returned to sender due to being unable to attain adult signature. However, they supplied NO tracking number, asked me if I wanted text notifications, I signed up for that. In the email I received from them stated they would make a 2nd attempt. They never did. If I would've had tracking notifications, I would've had made sure someone was here to sign. Worst service I've ever had with shipping!!!!Date of experience: August 10, 2023BBBuyer beware3 reviewsUSUpdated Nov 16, 2023I refused package multiple times and…I refused package multiple times \"Pups Dream\" and GLS they trespassed anyway. They said they would then pick up the package and return to sender (offshore) GLS is offshore too.Now they are saying I must contact (scam) offshore vendor. The package is not the size of the item purchased-over 60.00. Total thievery.I have reported them to the AG and Feds.GLS is making money off delivering for these scam businesses.Date of experience: November 11, 2023Q D1 reviewUSJul 21, 2023Bottom of the barrel, shameful levels of incompetenceI've had 2 companies use Gls Group for shipping and there hasn't been a single time I haven't had problems with them. I gave them the code to the gate and explicitly instructed to leave the package AT MY DOOR, like any other shipping or mail service does. These clowns make it a point to leave the package outside the gate in the middle of a busy street and call it a day. Result: package stolen and have to charge back my credit card. Customer support is inexistent, either by phone or through their website. If you are considering using Gls Group for shipping, stay away, you may lose customers and business.Date of experience: July 20, 2023CUCustomer5 reviewsUSSep 20, 2023HORRIBLE if I could give zero stars I…HORRIBLE if I could give zero stars I would.

Never on day original forecast and I think this is a trick to get you to send to depot rather than home.

This is my first experience with them and I pray it’s my last. Delivery attempt #1 on 2/7/24, the driver didn’t even wait 40 seconds before he left..I didn’t even have a chance to get to the door. Delivery attempt #2: 2/8/24, I reschedule for 4p-8p to guarantee I’ll be off work and able to sprint to the door in 40 seconds, no one showed up! I rescheduled for tomorrow between 8a-12p. We’ll see if I get my package. Oh yeah. Subscribed to text and email delivery alerts and have gotten nothing! What a joke of a company!Date of experience: February 06, 2024MIMilo5 reviewsESJun 18, 2021GLS is not reliable at all - AVOIDWe used this company to send a time-sensitive package from Italy to Spain. Even though we have a person to accept packages at the door at all times, they didn't attempt to call, contact, or even pass by to ring. they said that they didn't have any specific instructions on how to leave the package so returned it to the address in Italy, then attempted to recharge us to try again.  They appear to be more a money collection company than a shipping company, they are very good at asking for money, very bad at doing anything else.Date of experience: June 18, 2021DADaniel9 reviewsDEOct 20, 2022They do not care about their clientsI know they do not care about our reviews here as they never reply to their clients. However, I would like to leave mine. I ordered 3 different deliveries with them through another company. The first one, the boxes came very dirty. The second arrived one of them late and the third delivery was missing and one box arrived broken. Sadly I cannot add any picture here. Really disappointing service.

What an absolute scam of a delivery companyDate of experience: January 04, 2023AVAlexei Vostrikov2 reviewsUSDec 8, 2022My package scanned into the system on Nov 30, 2022My package scanned into the system on last Wednesday (Nov 30), stating the delivery would be on Friday (Dec 02). As always, it was delayed somewhere. It is now next Wednesday (Nov 7). After 7 days, it finally shows that the parcel is out for delivery. What I do not understand is that how come FedEx can always deliver in 2 days for the same route, while you guys take 7-10 days. And this is not the first occurrence. It happened so many times. I finally reached my shipper and asked them to not to use GLS for my packages. I wonder who runs your logistics? Bunch of primates? Am I at ballpark?Date of experience: December 07, 2022Steve Balestrieri1 reviewUSMar 15, 2024A Hugh disappointmentThis company had one job to complete. That job was to deliver my butchered deer, (my first ever buck) from the butcher to my house. Unfortunately it never arrived. The venison was apparently last scanned in at a transfer station and never seen again. I wonder where it went?I requested to be compensated for the cost of my guided hunt. What a joke that was! Even with my guide going to bat for me, they offered me peanuts. I would never use this company. I was so disappointed..Date of experience: September 15, 2023Marius Pal10 reviewsIEJan 13, 2021Avoid at all costs !Before deciding to buy anything online do yourself a huge favour and ask your seller if they use GLS as parcel carrier. If they do - you're DOOMED. Your parcel will get lost (Do keep in mind that is also useless to try to contact them, countless emails and euros spent trying to call them). That's what happened with my phone bought before Christmas. The parcel still shows as \"In transit\" from UK from over a month, and we are in the middle of January. I've contacted my seller and they also said they're still waiting for an answer from them. So, avoid GLS at all costs !Date of experience: January 13, 2021NENes4 reviewsDEOct 18, 2021Bad customer serviceUnfortunately a very bad customer service. I did not receive my parcel and not a note where the guy from GLS has left it. Also after several phone calls GLS has no interest to clarify the issue. They just refer to the system which mentions that the parcel is left in a kiosk at the other side of the city and that it is marked as delivered although it is not signed by me…Date of experience: October 18, 2021SASahil3 reviewsARApr 21, 2022Bunch of LiarsI had a parcel which was sent on April 8th. GLS kept adding same status EVERY day in tracking. I contacted them on several occasions, they told me that I will have the parcel delivered the next day. I kept calling them, and after two weeks they told me that they have lost my  package and I should contact the sender. However, the status suggests that the package is in their package center.Date of experience: April 21, 2022JMJM1 reviewUSJan 5, 2024GLS is problematicI ordered my package through Dyson on 12/26/23. I received notice from GLS that my package would be delivered 12/29/23, then delayed until 1/2/2024. That would have been fine but I could tell something wasn’t right because I had no notification, I contacted GLS to learn that they could not find the package but did not offer a solution. I told them it seems like someone in their facility may have stolen it. I then proceed to contact Dyson and they told me they are having a lot of problems with GLS. 1/4/2024 I received an email from GLS stating that my package was delivered. I contact customer support with GLS to learn it’s still missing and that they cannot help me or explain the email claiming delivery.

How do you give a no star review???I bought something from eBay that used GLS as the shipping. It was supposed to require a signature for delivery so much to my surprise I got a notice that it was delivered. I was at home and had not signed for it. So not only do I not have my pacakge but I'm working through many levels of ownership to try and get a refund. Does this company even try to deliever things or is it just a \"if we get to it you're lucky?\" kind of situation. No one seems to care that I don't have my package.

I tried it again and they told me they will look into it, and they would call me, they shut me down again and I never got called.

Avoid using them at all costsAnother horrendous experience with this bunch of cowboys. Avoid GLS at all costs. We learned three years ago never to use GLS after they consistently failed to deliver goods to us in rural Sicily, claiming they couldn’t find the address or had come but we weren’t in, despite our staying home all day and sometimes several days waiting in vain for the to arrive. But, we can’t always convince other companies that are sending us stuff not to use them and we’ve just had the same experience three years’ on, so they clearly haven’t learned. This time, rather than wait days in vain getting increasingly angry,  I shot down to their regional hub in Siracusa & collected our package myself. Their excuse for not delivering it was that they didn’t have enough information to find our house despite having our full address, phone number and a dropped pin. This company is owned by Britain’s Royal Mail? Is Her Majesty The Queen aware of the royal seal being used by these sharks?Date of experience: July 23, 2022Yu-Chen Hsu1 reviewDEFeb 13, 2024Stay away from this company for your mental healthI was clearly at home, but instead of ringing the doorbell and delivering, they just notified you that the delivery attempt failed. How could this happen? It happens every single time, and I've had no issues with other companies. The repeated back-and-forth communication regarding my package delivery has left me frustrated with their service. Terrible experiences.Date of experience: February 13, 2024yen snuff4 reviewsATJun 22, 2023Wasn't ringingWasn't ringing, I got the online notification I wasn't available. Few minutes later it was already in the store -  no way you can make it in that time to the store. Also waiting for 15 Minutes in the hotline - not helpful. They don't care. Don't accept packets from them, don't use their service if you're a vendor. You only harm your own rating.Date of experience: June 01, 2023James Lake1 reviewUSDec 8, 2023furious at shipping company GLSfurious at shipping company GLS. Beginning last week, I noticed that they were allegedly attempting delivery but citing different reasons every day. First it was a gate code so I called both the shipper and GLS to make sure they had the code. This code rings my phone so I can give them access. At no point during the four day period where they claimed to attempt to deliver my package, did I receive a phone call of any kind. I work from home so I am always home. I just don't leave. Yet each day the driver said I was not home. They just flat out lied each day and didn't attempt delivery. The building concierge even verified that GLS had not entered the building.Now, apparently my package is on the way back to the shipper. I called their customer service and they told me in the most rude fashion possible to go complain to the shipper. This is the most unprofessional company I have ever had the displeasure to deal with.Date of experience: December 07, 2023Naval Joshi4 reviewsNLOct 17, 2021Lost packageMy package was to be delivered from Slovenia to Netherlands.

All they do is shuffle the package back and forth without any reason as to why. Then when they try to deliver your package, they’ll say “couldn’t deliver” and “parcel encountered an anomaly”. What does that even mean?? Like seriously, did they encounter an alien anomaly that stopped them? How come I can order something from the US and it arrives within 3 days to EU with another company? But within EU, these lazy bunches take up to a month, if not more! Outrageous!! No customer support as they don’t even reply to your question, rather, give you more questions to your question. Absurd. And let’s not start with the with their “real-time updates”. I’ve never in my life seen a delivery company using different domains to update a package! One domain says that the package is stuck in their depot, another one says it’s delivering and another one hasn’t updated since it left! And to top it, they send you different emails to different domains all the time! Which one should I keep track of!? Dissolve this absolute trash of a delivery company!Date of experience: December 22, 2022Previous12345Next pageCompany activitySee allClaimed profileHasn’t replied to negative reviewsContactFrancePeople who looked at this company also looked atGLS18ClaimedGLS Germany47,884Asking for reviewsgls-canada.com33UnclaimedSuggested companies are based on people’s browsing tendencies.The Trustpilot ExperienceWe're open to allAnyone can write a Trustpilot review.

A local number text me Oct 29 and said “hey, I’ve got a package to deliver to you. Are you gonna be home?” I never thought that would have been a company. I text back and asked who it was. I never got a response. However, later that day, I saw an email and realized that my order of vape devices now require a signature from someone 21 and older. I put two into together and realize this was my order for the vapes. So I  go to look at tracking, the package is marked no one’s available. There was never a knock at my door or anything picked up on my ring camera. I text the number back. Sent two emails, now Nov 1, still no response. Thank you to the other review that gave a phone number. I’m going to try that now. I will update this review if it gets any better, but I’m not hopeful at all. This experience has made me 100% certain I will never order from a business again that uses this delivery service. I can only hope that in won’t take long before the companies they are contracted begin to realize they’re receiving a lot of complaints, dissatisfied customers & losing sales due to this delivery company.Date of experience: October 30, 2024L“Lynn “Gigi” Freeman13 reviewsUSSep 29, 2024Are they stealing packages?My package showed delivered to front door!

I’ve been doing HelloFresh for five years and never had a problem with delivery. I’ve had nothing but problems with them. They deliver late. It’s a business address. The door is locked. The door has hours 8 to 5 and they left it after hours on the door of a business. Of course it got stolen.  I have been in contact with them each week once noon hits and I don’t have the package like I normally do to tell them it has to be delivered before 5 pm, once they managed to call and said will be there by five every other time it’s a crapshoot and it either gets delivered the next day or it doesn’t get delivered on time and it gets delivered after hours to a locked business and stolen.  This is a trash, logistics company. Date of experience: August 26, 2024ANAnne1 reviewUSMay 31, 2023Poor customer service and delivery serviceThey deserve a zero for real.

I suspect they just don’t want to deliver to our house, which is in a more rural area. It happened twice just this week, 4 times in the past three months.Date of experience: August 11, 2023TYTaylor Young5 reviewsUSApr 3, 2024LSO is uselessLSO is useless. They never even attempted delivery and claimed its a \"bad address\". As you can see this is a common theme for them from the other reviews. I have never had this issue with other delivery services and trying to get assistance from them is like pulling teeth. They don't have a working phone number and frankly don't want to help you. We will cancel any future orders that uses LSO and will be letting our friends and family know about this scam of a company.

Ground shipping they claim to take 1-3 business days but everything ever shipped via LSO literally takes 2 weeks to get to me! I don’t know why Nordstrom uses them, it said my package was expected delivery on 7/26 and on 7/26 it was shown as in my city but still has not been delivered…no tracking updates and I actually think USPS is better than LSO! I can’t believe I’m saying that….Date of experience: July 29, 2023AdvertisementSHShine1 reviewUSMay 20, 2023PissedI had two packages waiting to be delivered from Fashion Nova. Both had the same delivery dates. Only one package arrived. The other order keeps getting switched from “it’s on its way!” To “local delivery delay”, to “exception” There used to be a delivery date, now the delivery date is blank.  You can’t speak to anyone. Never order from Fashion Nova If you need your merchandise in a timely manner. At this point I’m just going to request a refund.Date of experience: May 19, 2023GIGina1 reviewUSNov 10, 2023No response on lost shipmentThis carrier is losing shipments and responding to emails through their portal. You cannot speak with a person, all you get is an automated recording. My shipment has been unable to access and still hasn't changed and there has been no response. I also left a 1-star review for Fashion Nova for using them.Date of experience: November 08, 2023Janna Doughty1 reviewUSJun 6, 2023They deserve zero starsLike everyone else, they should be a ZERO! My package has been “out for delivery” since May 27th (it’s now June 5th) this company is an absolute joke and I cannot believe FabFitFun would use them let alone anyone else.  I heard from another customer in my area that they will literally leave packages on sidewalks and roll up in a freaking Camry. If you package ends up with LSO you can expect it to be delayed or lost. And good luck getting customer service to respond.Date of experience: June 05, 2023Pat Paulsen1 reviewUSJul 27, 2023LSO Has No Customer ServiceLSO has no customer service. I tried contacting them about a missing shipment, but they do not respond to emails, and if you try calling them you get a message saying that they are, \"Unable to answer calls\". It's a joke!

These people delivered my package to the wrong apartment then stole it! They didn’t know the neighbors across the hall had a camera in the window and caught everything. LSO count your days.

Date of experience: March 21, 2024AdvertisementAmber Baise1 reviewUSJan 3, 2024The ABSOLUTE WORST…Please refrain from ordering anything online if they are using this company to ship with. This is the most incompetent and laziest shipping company I’ve ever experienced. Not to mention they lie a lot and steal packages. I made sure I stayed home three days straight to make sure that I was here when my package arrived because it was constantly saying “unable to access”. After the three days, the status updated twice, saying the same thing when no one had ever even attempted to deliver my package. This company alone makes me not want to order online simply because I don’t know if they are being used to ship packages or not.Date of experience: January 02, 2024CICindy 3 reviewsUSAug 10, 2023Negative zero would be an accurate…Negative zero would be an accurate rating for this company.  They are absolutely the worst delivery service. I don’t understand why Nordstrom continues to use them.  LSO lied about delivering my package, stating the building was closed.  The concierge in my building is available until 10pm every day. You can’t call them , all you get is “unable to take your call” message.  Oh and don’t try to email, you’ll get no response.  There’s no update on the website to track your package. I don’t understand how they are still in business.Date of experience: August 03, 2023Maksym Pozomin1 reviewUSMar 25, 2024Shein order. They don't know how to deliver thingsOrdered something from Shein, they shipped the package using this LSO company. They misdelivered my package and when I contacted them they basically did nothing. The driver delivered the package to a maintenance room in the apartment complex instead of delivering to my apartment. Some of you may think, maybe I didn't specify the apartment number, but I did! If you can't find the right apartment, drop it off to the front office, but not to a maintenance door. They didn't apologize or offer any solution. All they did after I told them about the missing package was wishing me a good day and advising to contact the seller. The worst people ever.

Do not use them.Date of experience: April 17, 2023AdvertisementGOGob1 reviewUSOct 16, 2023The worstI don't believe any consumers actually want to use this company. They lose (or I suspect steal) packages regularly and if by chance they actually deliver your package don't be surprised if it's to the wrong location or shows up damaged. I honestly think they have a bunch of thieves and incompetent employees. Complain to whoever you buy stuff from to stop using this service. It worked for me (REI quit using them eventually, I assume after so many complaints). Never had these repeated issues with other couriers.Date of experience: September 21, 2023SBSamantha Bennett2 reviewsUSAug 9, 2023Worst Shipping CompanyAnytime I order from Target and see that the shipping is through LSO, I know I'm screwed. This time the package took an entire extra week to be delivered. There was never up to date or accurate tracking detail. When it finally was delivered without notice, a random personal SUV with local plates pulled into my drive way, parked, and then the person delivering the packed took her sweet time getting it out of the back while talking on the phone and putting it in front of my door where I can't get to it without pushing it out of the way. This company is trash and should not be allowed to exist.Date of experience: August 09, 2023LILiz1 reviewUSJul 26, 2023LSO company is literally horribleLSO company is literally horrible. 7/25/23 they literally delivery me an empty box .

Each time the package was not placed into a locker, resulting in theft. Per my apartment management, there are clear instructions to deliver packages to the locker. Somehow, all 3 deliveries were placed on the ground and were missing by the time I went to retrieve the package just a few hours later. I feel like the diver is not placing the package in the locker on purpose so that they can steal it. Every time I reached out to the company, they claim it was “delivered correctly” despite the package being wedged into the corner of the package room floor. I also find it ironic that the corner of choice is the only dead zone for the cameras.  This company is terrible, and their customer service is even worse.

I've never seen a worse logistics carrier. Based on their tracking tool, my package leaves from Dallas, TX en route to Olathe, KS (20 minutes from Kansas City). However, when it gets to Kansas City they often route the package back to Dallas. Once the package made it to the hub in Olathe, where I live....instead of delivering the package to my home...they sent back to Dallas.

Like... what??? Amazon, Fedex, DHL, USPS, Wal-Mart and Target always deliver packages to my house easily with no issues.

For me, this is the 3rd package that was supposedly been delivered that I have not received. It’s not hard! My address is a giant apartment building with a front office that is open during business hours. If you can’t locate my apartment number, leave it at the office during business hours or in the mail room where we have secure package lockers. But, that would be if LSO was really trying to deliver.  I think y’all are just stealing packages and you should be prosecuted.Date of experience: July 10, 2023AdvertisementDBDavid Brown2 reviewsUSMar 6, 2024AbsurdThis is a flawed company. The only thing worse than their customer service is the actual service they're supposed to provide. Upon tracking my package I discovered I was a closed business with no access. I am a residence with wide open access. It took 4 days of constant emails for them to update tracking to out for delivery. They failed to show once again. I offered many times to pick up package if they would give me a location to do so. No response to this no response to where package was no response to my concerns. How this company stays in business with such practices is beyond my comprehension. I rate them a one only because it's the lowest available review they are not worth one star.

I have never had a good experience with this shipper. One week ago tracking says package departed OSM facility in York PA (about 70 miles from me) still not package - if you see a seller using OSM - do not purchase from that merchantDate of experience: October 01, 2024RMRichard Miracle6 reviewsUSOct 10, 2024Pathetic IncompetenceI have three books on order from different sellers.  All of these vendors use OSM and claim that OSM picked up the packages from  them on or before Sept. 25.  Now Oct. 10, the tracking numbers all say awaiting delivery to USPS.  How can it take 3 weeks to deliver the books to USPS which in all cases is less than 15 miles from the seller?  It is utterly pathetic, I will never use these guys again, if I have a choice.Date of experience: September 25, 2024Joshua Oakey1 reviewUSSep 9, 2024Worst Shipping Partner there is!!!I've personally never encountered a worse shipping company! Takes weeks if not months to receive a shipment from them! They should be banned from American! Ordering something from China is 2 to 3 times faster than anything OSM WORLDWIDE can handle. What a disgraceful company!!Date of experience: August 25, 2024MCMichael Chasteen3 reviewsUSSep 5, 2024Worst Service EverOrdered a DVD from an Amazon seller. The item shipped from DC to Memphis. (Normally 2-3 day delivery time) OSM shows multiple scans at 6 anonymous facilities over a 9 day period. Twice I was notified it would arrive by 8;00PM tomorrow. Then they said it would take another 6 days. I canceled the order. I will not buy from another seller using OSM.Date of experience: September 04, 2024JAJames1 reviewUSOct 2, 2024OSM ruins online shoppingAmazon and eBay packages shipped with OSM are taking forever, sometimes more than a month and some never arrive.

Now I have to wait 3-4 weeks and then order again.Date of experience: October 02, 2024kyle webb1 reviewUSSep 21, 202412 days, 800 miles, still no package - BUYER BEWAREPackage was supposed to arrive in 2-5 days.  Took OSM 3 days to pick the item up.  Then took 7 days to get the package from Illinois to Nevada (bypassing my state Colorado).  Now the package is sitting in Nevada with no movement.  OSM is a partner of USPS.  Ask your seller if they use OSM or USPS.  If they do, refuse to do business unless the use another shipper.  OSM needs to be driven out of business.  They don't care about the customer.  They'll just give you a copy paste answer if you inquire.Date of experience: September 20, 2024FFFishing for Zoras21 reviewsUSAug 15, 2024Useless shipping middlemen from hellIf you want your order to take three weeks because it sits at the same location and doesn't move for 2 of those weeks, use these *********. Seriously, **** this company. They're the poster child of unnecessary middlemen from hell who take your money in exchange for making shipping slower and worse. ****nuggets every last person who works for them. Which must be only like 4 people as evidenced by how long anything takes to ship!

My package arrived in Dallas Texas 13 days ago and usps STILL HAS NOT RECEIVED my package. I’ve let several inquiries at their customer service email (of course they don’t have a phone number) and no one is responding! Dallas is four hours away from me I’ll gladly go get it but there’s no way to actually speak to a representative. I’ll be doing some research from this point forward because this entire process has been so stressful. Any seller that has ties with this company will not have a me as a customer !Date of experience: August 18, 2024Christopher Vanasse2 reviewsUSAug 14, 2024Just adding on to the pileJust adding on to the pile. These sorts of parcel services (akin to Lasersh*t/ OnTrac) shouldn’t be allowed to operate as a they do. They are basically a third party staging area dumping ground for shipments that USPS deems non priority, with no accountability from them or to the remittance. Days and weeks of no updates and no movement from their useless tracking site.  I would go so far as to suggest not purchasing from ANY vendor that only ships USPS if your item is high dollar simply to avoid them Date of experience: August 13, 2024Jeff Becker1 reviewUSAug 14, 2024Ordered a book July 23 and the USPS…Ordered a book July 23 and the USPS tracking number shows it was \"Picked Up By Shipping Partner, USPS Awaiting Item SECAUCUS, NJ 07094.\" It is now three weeks later, Aug 14, and the tracking shows exactly the same message. So USPS, as bad as they themselves are, doesn't even have the item yet. If they're shipping from Europe as I suspect and that is what the delay is about, THE SELLER SHOULD INDICATE THAT and the expected delay on their Ebay listing!Date of experience: July 23, 2024RARanae3 reviewsUSSep 3, 2024Worst delivery compayThis is the worst delivery company of all time. This is the 2nd time I have been forced by a company to use OSM- I am never given a choice.Current pkg started out in Pennsylvania August 29. My current pkg is sitting in Illinois since August 31 at 7:30pm. It is now Sept 3 at 4pm in Omaha & my pkg hasn't moved.It has been my previous experience that OSM pkgs take at least 10 days to reach any address in the US.At least with USPS or Amazon or UPS or FedEx you know it usually is only 3-6 days.OSM seems to be hooked up with USPS, which is sad because USPS is generally reliable for pkg delivery.But OSM does NOT work weekends it looks like. Previous pkg was not shipping during a holiday.So all I can do is put in a bad review about OSM because I can't make the other companies stop doing business with twrDate of experience: September 03, 2024JIm Bob1 reviewUSSep 10, 2024HP uses this company for instant inkGo uses this company for instant ink;  they should call delayed ink;  the package has gone from Delaware to pa in 5 days; I’m in Florida so I should get my ink in time for the Super Bowl in 5-6 monthsDate of experience: September 10, 2024Gregory Dial6 reviewsUSUpdated Aug 28, 2024The Black Hole of shipping consolidatorsTracking is incorrect, company lies about status, Customer Service copies and pastes boilerplate from the website when inquiry is made. Different Customer Service agents give wildly different reasons for delays, and use phrasing like, \"Hopefully, it will be delivered by...\", and \"It appears to be lost in transit...\", none of which gives hope that their \"data-driven\" service is any less fictional than their parcel status reporting. Most recent experience: item shipped 24 July was received in Secaucus, NJ on 27 July...and has now been there for over a month. OSM denies they have it, claims Secaucus is NOT a facility, but just \"a zip code.\" Status shows \"Picked up by shipping partner\"; guess who \"shipping partner\" is: OSM Worldwide. Two Customer non-Service reps say \" Picked up\" doesn't really mean what the entire English-speaking world thinks it means...turns out it means \"logged into the system\". Who knew? Worst service ever.Date of experience: July 31, 2024Tommy McTurtleson1 reviewUSMay 30, 2024Incredibly slowIncredibly slow. OSM for some reason held the package for 5 days in one location before passing it on to USPS who are now delivering it the same day they received. To be fair, we are still inside the original guesstimate time of arrival. I was in no big hurry to receive this package (a book). Part of the reason I purchased from the eBay vendor was it was so cheap with shipping included. I am guessing OSM rents the book out for a few days to subsidize their costs.Date of experience: May 30, 2024AMAmy1 reviewUSSep 10, 2024My package has been 30 miles away for 5 days I live in southwest Houston. My package has been sitting in a warehouse in north Houston since Friday. It is now Tuesday and I still haven’t received it. I could’ve walked there and back in 2 days to pick it up.

It moved along, very quickly, arriving in Grand Prairie, TX on the morning of July 17, 2024.  Departed Grand Prairie on the evening of July 17.  Looked great!

Today it’s somewhere else with a possible delivery by July 31st. ISM does not meet its commitments, Amazon does not ACTUALLY real-time shipping information creating confusion and anger. OSM does not care, Amazon has gotten to big to care.

I am SO Grateful.Date of experience: March 04, 2024David Scott2 reviewsUSJan 30, 2024My book showed up on time.My book showed up on the day that eBay estimated. I initially thought it was shipping through the Post Office, but then I saw it was with OSM partner shipper. I didn't know what that meant, so I did a search to learn more.I was concerned with the preponderance of bad reviews so I waited. So this time I am glad they used a 3rd party shipping company which got it to a Post Office near me - especially now with the issues with mail getting stuck for weeks at the new postal sorting center near Houston.Date of experience: January 29, 2024TheChronicsmoka1 reviewUSJun 30, 2024Takes at least 3 weeks to get packages…Takes at least 3 weeks to get packages that only took 3 days before OSM started shipping for the company I order from. Hands down one of the worst shipping companies. Packages just sit around for weeks before they decide they want to ship them. Almost to the point of using a different company to order from because OSM is so slow. Date of experience: June 29, 2024CLCraig L1 reviewUSMay 3, 2024Ridiculously slow and when asked where…Ridiculously slow and when asked where my package was they blamed USPS even though tracking clearly states that they have the package! Package was rerouted nonsensically from my home town through at least two other distant cities. I cannot stand these worthless companies like this that do nothing but cause problems for everyone. Date of experience: May 02, 2024KEKenra1 reviewUSUpdated Aug 28, 2024Book Held HostageOrdered a book on EBay July 23, picked up by OSM on July 24, and been sitting in Secaucus, NJ ever since. No movement whatsoever. It’s just a used book, but it’s important to me, and was supposed to be given as a birthday gift. Now I wonder if I’ll ever see it. Maybe if EBay and Amazon have to refund or gets enough complaints for packages not received, they’ll stop using this obviously terrible company as a “shipping partner.” Now I know to look out for OSM and avoid, avoid, avoid buying anywhere online that may be using them. How naive I was to think USPS handled it all. I know we complain how the post office can be slow, but they are a dream compared to this service. **UPDATE** To be fair, I did finally get my book. It was three weeks past expected, but they finally moved it along. Date of experience: August 13, 2024James Grantham1 reviewUSJun 19, 2024I placed an order through ebayI placed an order through ebay and the item was shipped USPS with OSM being Shipping partner. was picked up on Friday June 14th in Chicago, didn't arrive at Glendale Heights until June 18th and left the same morning. Less than a 10 hour drive to Nashville. Its now been 30 hours since it departed and is still not in Nashville. I think these companies (including USPS) should quit using them. Very poor service.Date of experience: June 19, 2024PKPepper King4 reviewsUSAug 26, 2024The WORST shipping company on earthThey currently have 2 of my packages and both should have been delivered to me by now. The tracking information hasn't changed in over a week. I opened PayPal cases on both items. This place needs to be shut down. They are hideously bad. After reading multiple bad reviews, I know I will never receive my items. Date of experience: August 16, 2024DFD Fa1 reviewUSJun 7, 2024What a terrible 3rd party shipperWhat a terrible 3rd party shipper. They claim to be an asset to the USPS by being a last mile shipper, but with their logistics you would be better off doing a cross country trip and picking up your package yourself. What an absolute joke of a shipping company, 21 years in business is amazing with a logistics model as laughable as this.If you are a seller looking for a package handling service, just give it to the USPS or whoever directly. Your customers will thank you.Date of experience: May 25, 2024MIMichael26 reviewsUSJun 24, 2024OSM should be banned from operating.On May 14 2024 I ordered a book from an Amazon partner, one supposedly located in Montgomery, IL, although the bookseller's parent company is in the UK.  I suspect the bookseller shipped the book from the UK because I live in Texas, due south of IL, and the book arrived at the OSM facility in Secaucus, NJ, on June 13 2024.  Today is June 24, and the book is still in the OSM facility in NJ.  To say that this is a disgrace is, obviously, a tremendous unterstatement.Date of experience: June 24, 2024MTMike Torelli5 reviewsUSJul 17, 2024I ordered an item that was shipped om…07/07/2024I ordered an item that was shipped om July 7th, it's now July 17th and it's sitting in a warehouse in Ga.

As reported by 95% of people on here, pkgs make it to York PA or Glendale Heights IL, and then they sit for one to two weeks as USPS \"awaits item.\" They seem to operate using the same tortoise-paced bulk shipping practices as the godawful UPS Mail Innovations (which directs pkgs in my region to Smyrna TN to rot in a warehouse). What it comes down to is, these companies are boosting their profit margins at the expense of prompt customer service. But who cares about customers, right? They have no recourse except to wait, and the freight company is only responsible to their shareholders.Date of experience: May 16, 2024Paul Keith1 reviewUSMay 20, 2024The Pony Express was faster and more…The Pony Express was faster and more efficient.  I can't do anything at this point to change the vendor's \"Shipping Partner\" but I can (and will) never buy from that vendor again as long as they continue to use OSM Worldwide as their chosen \"shipping\" partner.  (Question for vendors who do use this scam company:  What planet were you folks on when you chose OSM and what were you smoking while you were there?) Date of experience: May 12, 2024PHPerson Human1 reviewUSNov 11, 2023OSM isn't that badAll these negative reviews are mostly just generating hysteria, this is from a loud minority. First experience with OSM, absolutely no problem. Was picked up on the 6th, arrived at York, PA on the 7th. Once at York, it left the same day around the afternoon, and arrived at my USPS regional facility on the 8th in the evening. After this point, my review wouldn't be on OSM, it would be on USPS, so I will not include any more information. OSM fulfilled their duty in the time mentioned, and the package was delivered in the 1-5 business day promise.Date of experience: November 10, 2023GEGeorgeM2 reviewsUSJul 17, 2024They are the WORSTThey are the WORST. I don't think I'll ever shop at Alibris again--second time a seller has used that crap company and the ITEMS NEVER ARRIVE. WHY ARE THEY PERMITTED TO EXIST? How does anyone do any business with a rotten no good company like OSM?Date of experience: July 17, 2024DADaddio3 reviewsUSAug 29, 2023Glacially slow, prehistorically stupid…Small package in transit for more than three weeks now, destined for eastern NC.  Most recently, package went to OSM center in PA, then to Raleigh NC, then to Fayetteville NC, then to Richmond Va....yes, it's going backwards now.  Involvement of USPS is always a losing proposition; transit from Singapore based business through China, to Canada, to US used up the first two weeks.  Looks like OSM/USPS are going for the record.  Seller, of course, neglected to state it operates out of Singapore, to begin with.  Small wonder this vendor's single star is only because you can't rate less than one, overall.Date of experience: August 29, 2023THTheKlap1 reviewUSJul 11, 2024I wish I could give a ZEROIf I could give them ZERO stars, I would. I have had a package sitting, in a town 30 minutes from me for days without being switched over to the USPS for delivery.

Osm worldwide is the shipping partner. What I really dont get is why sellers need shipping partners for every little thing? Have they really became so lazy and lame that they cant drop a few items off at the post office themselves. For a while I thought maybe USPS just hadn't updated the app but then my roommate who is also getting deliveries from other sellers is actually getting updates so now I am convinced that OSM WORLDWIDE is the culpritThis seller just lost a customer because of them.Date of experience: March 29, 2024JOJoe2 reviewsUSSep 11, 2022Been over a month, no package.Been over a month since ordering from a clothing company located in LA California. Tracking as not updated or moved since…. Y’all suck, hope you go bankrupt from inflation, money sucking truckers, poor equipment maintenance, and I hope all your sponsors decide to go another route for 3rd party deliveries. A pizza guy delivering pizza locally will turn over more product for his company in a months time frame that yours can cover in a couple weeks with them box trucks. Do not deal with this garbage company.Date of experience: September 11, 2022JBJoshua Bittman6 reviewsUSJul 26, 2024They will STEAL your packagesNot only is their customer service NON existent but their leadership does not care either because \"they were already paid\" I had an item that shows it is at the facility less than 10 minutes from my house and now they are saying it may be lost when it shows they have it. Customer service said \"it takes 2-5 business days to transfer to USPS\" they said that to me after emailing them that they were 2+weeks past the expected delivery date. The same canned email messages when you email their support team which I am sure they will post the same canned message to this review as they did everyone elses.Date of experience: July 26, 2024ADAlex Dean6 reviewsUSAug 20, 2024OSM is the worst shipping company I…OSM is the worst shipping company I have seen. My package was supposed to be delivered the 9th, today is the 20th, still not here. These morons should not be in business. Everything about them is a joke. My package was to be shipped from N.C to N.D, OSM or morons as they should be called, kept it in Georgia most of the time, than to Texas, sit there forever. Apparently they don't own a compass. I hope they go out of business soon. Probably before I receive my package.Date of experience: August 07, 2024MEMelissa9 reviewsUSApr 21, 2024Packages from China take less timePackages from China take less time. I had an order ship out on the 8th of April, it sat at one location for 4 days before it even moved. On the 11th if finally moved and kept moving until the 15th where is has been sitting for 5 days and counting. The package is an hour from my house and they can't seem to hand it off to USPS and I know the Meriden post office is right there. Why do companies continue to use this shipping company?Date of experience: April 20, 2024KEKevin1 reviewUSFeb 25, 2023Do better!They suck at getting packages to the customer! I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I’d much rather use DHL (who is slow, but not this slow). My package has been sitting for three days in Glendale Heights. Yet, says departed. Apparently OSM doesn’t know that departed is supposed to mean, gone, left, not at our facility anymore. Don’t mark it departed until it actual is. This is ridiculous!Date of experience: February 23, 2023DLDennis L3 reviewsUSApr 23, 2024This is a very shady and untrustworthyThis is a very shady and untrustworthy shipping partner. I ordered something from dbrand who shipped it through OSM who would then hand it off to USPS locally.However when i got the package it was torn open, barely taped together and with a large note courtesy of the USPS saying that the package had been opened prior to them receiving it. Which means OSM opened my package and rummaged through it, something they should not be doing, it is a health and safety concern. I would understand if the package had to cross borders and border patrol and customs however, it did not need to cross any of those as the route was all US states.Never order from anysite that uses OSM such as dbrandDate of experience: April 19, 2024TRTrevor Ragin1 reviewUSApr 4, 2024If I could rate it less than one star I…If I could rate it less than one star I would. Why does this company even exist. They are the slowest delivery service I have ever dealt with in my life. My package has been stuck in “York PA” and hasn’t moved for 5 freaking days. After further researching k found a plethora of dissatisfied customer who would rather their seller had not used this service.If anyone in charge of the company happens to read this, get your shxt together.Date of experience: April 03, 2024JCJC2 reviewsUSMay 5, 2024Terrible logistics and customer service…Had an order come in internationally to NY in 2 days. Made it from NY to GA in 1 day. From GA to OSM Worldwide in Glendale Heights, IL, their world headquarters, in 1 day. For 14 days it sat there showing 0 updates. Still haven't gotten my order. Tried their customer service and it was useless.Date of experience: April 21, 2024JDJohn D2 reviewsUSDec 23, 2023Trash Company!Really bad customer service and shipping speeds are abysmal. Customer service doesn’t take accountability and will not give you any information.They have made me start to inquire about shipping service used by companies and I will no longer purchase from any company that uses them as a third party shipper. I have packages that have been sitting with them for weeks (4 at this point)! Seriously, go out of business because you are adding no value to our human existence and are wasting peoples time and money.Date of experience: December 22, 2023LulaRoe Jen Struk3 reviewsUSMay 14, 2024SCAM COMPANYSo confusing.  My package was delivered from Smyrna TN to Austell, GA where it has literally sat for 3 days and now been scanned again as having just \"arrived\" again, as if it has not already arrived and been scanned 3 days earlier.  Then an hour later it departs the facility finally but no further info , USPS is still \"awaiting item\" and no ETA. $300 in skincare products I ordered almost a week ago.  I ordered other products the same day from different companies that have already been delivered.  Why anyone would use this shipp8mg partner that is clearly useless and moving things around or.golding onto things in order to up charge their vendors is beyond me.  This company needs to be shut down.  Total scam.Date of experience: May 14, 2024Kevin Clarke1 reviewUSNov 28, 2023This carrier is as slow as MolassesThis is my second experience in the last few weeks where a merchant used OSM Worldwide for a package shipment.   The first package took 13 business days to arrive from NY to NV.   The second package has now sat in York, PA for over a week and I tracked it today and it is still there.   I don't understand what the value is utilizing this company instead of just shipping directly with USPS?  It should not take multiple weeks to transport something that any other carrier would deliver in 3-5 business days at the latest.Date of experience: November 27, 2023TJTJ2 reviewsUSApr 11, 2023What a dumpster fire...Bought expensive glasses from two different companies, both shipped using this company... Spending $300 on a heavily marked up item and you can't spend the $8 to use USPS priority mail, rather than the what, $5 to have this company bounce my package all across the US for 10-15 days and provide inaccurate delivery dates? Looking at you Warby Parker and Glasses USA. I think we can all agree that shipping speed and reliability are top priorities for e-commerce... Which OSM does not provide.Date of experience: April 08, 2023Stanley Turner1 reviewUSJun 22, 2023Transit makes NO SENSE…My rating is the same as almost everyone else, the tracking makes no sense at all. Half the time is just says “in transit.” Other times it is even crazier, order a book from merchant in Georgia, thinking it would be pretty quick shipping to Tennessee, but I was WRONG, the book went to Illinois first, then Texas before eventually making it to Nashville and two days later Lynchburg. Around the world in 15 days to travel what is less than a 3 hour drive.Date of experience: June 22, 2023EHElizabeth Holmes1 reviewUSJul 23, 2024Water damage Driver left my package, a large hardcover book, on my steps instead of under porch one foot away. Now there’s water damage from heavy rain. Date of experience: July 22, 2024REreed1 reviewUSAug 7, 2024they can do their jobthey can do their job.  they get paid for the simple task of moving packages from vendors to the post office. literally no ability needed, and if the vendor's had brains they would realize that USPS would come get their packages for free... but no, they trust OSM.  And OSM adds days and days to the process. My package was ready to go 8/1... OSM finally got around to picking up the package and moving it the 2 blocks to the post office 5 days later. Only took the vendor 3 days to make my glasses but OSM doubled the delay letting the package sit.Date of experience: August 06, 2024ICIvey Cole5 reviewsUSAug 15, 2023So far haven't received my shipmentSo far haven't received my shipment.  It started in Dallas, TX on Aug 7, arrived in York, PA on Aug 13, departed Aug 15 to who knows where.  The destination is Coleman, TX which is about 200 miles from Dallas.  Under any circumstances will I place an order with a company that I know is using OSM Worldwide.  Life's too short to deal with such poor service.  Any maybe I never get my shipment.Date of experience: August 15, 2023Charles Seymour Jr4 reviewsUSFeb 3, 2024WHAT is going on with this delay!!?WHAT is going on? USPS Tracking tells me that my package arrived at OSM in Aston PA (from York PA) on January 22 and it still hasn't moved into the USPS system to deliver it to me: about FIVE MILES AWAY!How can I contact the Aston location to get things moving?Date of experience: January 22, 2024NANancy3 reviewsUSJul 20, 2023I wish I could give this ZERO starsI wish I could give this ZERO stars! In tracking my package it took 4 days from time picked up in North Las Vegas until it left North Las Vegas. Then it took two days to get from there to Grand Prairie, Texas. Then it supposedly arrived in Grand Prairie at 2:30pm and departed from that location at 4:16 destination USPS. We are now 5 days after that and USPS has not yet received the package. Who knows whether my granddaughter will EVER RECEIVE her birthday gift.Date of experience: July 19, 2023Scott Ryan1 reviewUSFeb 15, 2023Just like everyone elseJust like everyone else, apparently Grand Prairie is where packages go to die....  Thanks for losing my package and not taking responsibility for it, OSM.  I have reached out to them twice for support and gotten the same copy and pasted response both times that I should reach out to the shipper for more info.  Clearly the shipper isn't the one who lost the package since OSM had it and tracked it to Grand Prairie.

They left it outside my POBox mail center after business hours on the Saturday before July fourth. Due to the holiday, my mail center didn’t reopen until Weds, July 5th.

They did not bother looking at the addresses at all, instead found the first apartment number that matched and dumped my package. Then when I contacted customer service about this again they sent my a claim form to fill out that I couldn't even get to open or download. The company has a subscription that I forgot to cancel that auto sends stuff each month, that have already been processed for shipping before I realized, and I'm positive that I won't be getting these items either.Date of experience: February 06, 2023JAJacob1 reviewUSDec 7, 2022Incompetent Courier ServiceMy package arrived at Parcll’s sort facility in Jamaica, Queens on November 17; nearly three weeks ago. I haven’t received an update since then. It’s absolutely ludicrous given that this is merely a shipment from NY to CA, and is under their “Expedited Northeast” service. Not to mention the fact that Parcll doesn’t have a single consumer avenue for contact. I had to ask the business I ordered from to contact Parcll, who informed them that it would be delivered last week. It has still not been delivered.

How can packages get lost? I'm very disappointed as these 3 packages contained our personal item from our cross country move that ended up staying behind. Our friends mailed to us and now our personal belongings are forever lost. Very 😔 sad. I am praying that somehow a mircle will take place and we at some point might get them.Date of experience: November 08, 2024AdvertisementJohn Greenwood1 reviewAUNov 1, 2024Cheap prices using cheap incompentent driversPurchase a item online from ebay, the item was sent using Sendle. We are a business with a large corner block in a industrial area, we have large signage stating who we are and out Lot number, we have been here for 20 years. We are Lot 11 and are on a two road corner, when we buy online we use our address and also state the two road corner we are on. The drives that Sendle use to deliver parcels are so incompetent they go to number 11 which is a vacate block, get confused backup and drop of at number 9 on the front step, and call this delivered. This is a ongoing problem which I am sure I am not the only one who has this happen to them. I am now going to try to only use the corner of the two roads as my address for my deliveries let see if they still can't find me.Date of experience: October 31, 2024Kristen Stannix1 reviewCAOct 30, 2024Great if they actually show upThey literally never pick up on time. The system automatically schedules the pick up again for the next day, which again results in the driver not showing up again. Every time this happens I go to the chat because there is zero phone number to contact them. I am told someone will come that day. Lo and behold no one shows again. Ask for a manager as this is continuous problems almost with every shipment. No manager called me. I am canceling the account as it’s is just not worth the follow up on packages.Date of experience: October 18, 2024MIMichelle3 reviewsAUOct 24, 2024Caution. Very long delivery times from Perth.The delivery time from Perth to anywhere is ridiculously long.  The stress it causes me as a casual eBay seller is not worth it.  Be cautious that if you ask for an investigation into a non-delivered package, they take longer by taking 7 days to find the parcel. If not located you can claim on their insurance but this will cover refunding the buyer not the additional missing item. Date of experience: October 24, 2024Joseph Caserta8 reviewsGBOct 29, 2024Horrible Company The customer service made the whole situation completely worse, failed to pick up my parcel 4 times and then lost my parcel after three months and then failed to provide any compensation.

Held my package for more than a week in their depot. Couldn’t do a customer pickup because it takes 48 hours to process… no it’s just laziness. Terrible “customer service”. I had to chase up every single update, they never took initiative to talk to me. I ended up telling them how much of a piece of crap (worded differently) company they are and I don’t ever do that. Never gave the initiative to give me notice when it was delivered. I of course had to send an email to let them know. Full of laziness, disorganisation and lack of training.

That's parcel not picked up on THREE CONSECUTIVE OCCASIONS! Every time I chat to their operator they tell me the same thing, that 'occasionally' traffic is high and parcel don't get picked up. OCCASIONALLY does not mean every single time for 3 consecutive times! They use contract drivers and they clearly don't care about the job. 2 star review only because the chat operators are well mannered.Date of experience: April 15, 2024AdvertisementJVJim V11 reviewsUSFeb 17, 2023InvitedBest, Most Cost-Effective Shipping Platform Ever!I have an on-line retail store and have struggled with multiple shipping business, and platforms, but settled on Sendle.

Have had a number of parcels from them. Guaranteed to be delayed and take way longer than anyone else. However, parcels have arrived safely and delivered to my  door. However, I now try to avoid sellers that use them for deliveries.Date of experience: December 18, 2023AdvertisementPaul Collins2 reviewsAUAug 31, 2023Sendle needs to get reliable drivers…Sendle needs to get reliable drivers who pick up when they should. Or follow their own guidelines/promises that they'll send a dedicated driver to pick up if items haven't been collected on time. A pick up time from 8am-6pm is just ridiculous. No small business I know opens at 8am and closes at 6pm. I have my driver's mobile number and most times he won't even respond if I ask if he's still picking up. Being a sole operator I'm stuck at my office all day till he turns up -- that is, IF he turns up. A simple response to my text would be fine, but no, he simply can't be bothered to tell me he's not coming. There goes another day that I'm held captive at my premises. It's extremely frustrating.Date of experience: August 29, 2023VKVilmarie Koesema1 reviewUSMar 7, 2023Simple, beautiful & affordableSendle has been instrumental in our small business.

Unlike some of the other reviews, they use USPS and not their own drivers.  The \"Good\" is:1) The pricing very competitive especially on small packages.2) They provide insurance on packages.The \"Bad\" is:1) They will only provide their tracking numbers and this confuses Amazon and eBay Customers.2) eBay and Amazon, once they see that tracking number will provide no support on delivery issues and forces the seller to issue an immediate credit.3) Sendle will NOT provide information on Claims that you file.  This is unaccepatable and over time what we found out is that they hide this information because they rarely provide any refunds.  Before writing this review, gave them multiple opportunities to address.In the end, if you are selling on Amazon or eBay they are not worth the trouble.Date of experience: January 02, 2024MGMegan Geier2 reviewsUSFeb 8, 2023InvitedSendle is perfect for my small business!Sendle is so easy to use and has great prices for a small business like mine!

My office is literally 1 minutes walk from a post office. Fielding questions from annoyed customers knowing that a more reliable service was only a stone's throw away is agony. Sendle you HAVE to take CouriersPlease out of your network. Sure they might consistently bid the lowest to secure more jobs, but they clearly have no issue constantly breaching SLAs.Either deliver on your promises, or charge more until you can.Date of experience: June 26, 2024CFCathy Farger3 reviewsCAAug 6, 2024Never......NEVER......allow a parcel to…Never......NEVER......allow a parcel to be sent via Sendle. It will sit in a depot for weeks and launching an investigation will go completely ignored. The drivers they hire in Canada come from another city and have no idea where they are going and your parcel just gets stuck in a pile in their depot because they dont know how to find your house, no matter how easy you make it for them. It's stunning how their drivers can't deliver a simple package. I've given up on ever seen my parcel.Date of experience: August 06, 2024FBFran Battendieri1 reviewUSFeb 11, 2023InvitedI only received a Partial OrderI only received a Partial Order, and upon contacting the Business, they responded immediately and sent the rest of the Order within days!

Lost x15 of my packages from Australia to Europe with no refund. No communication, very slow to look into what happened. Parcels are now said to be destroyed by DHL due to their lack of communication. Has damaged my business, lost me a lot of money and damaged my reputation. No offer of a refund or any compensation.After using for years, I will NEVER use again.Date of experience: June 30, 2024AdvertisementJEJason Evans4 reviewsAUApr 24, 2024Not reliable, potential exploitation.Sendle is not a reliable service, not turning up on expected day often, extremely narrow accepted package dimensions. Limited customer service when something goes wrong. I've also noted recently they have dropped their rates. This starts to ring alarm bells for me, not enticing me to use them again. Do drivers get fairly compensated or are they being exploited here? While most carriers rates are increasing in 2023/24 as fuel and running costs go up, Sendle drops their pricing. No thanks, dodgy dodgy dodgy.

Here's a rundown of what went wrong:- Late Delivery: The delivery was supposed to take 3-5 days- High Costs: For the price I paid, I expected a reliable and efficient service. Instead, I got the opposite. There are much better and more affordable options out there.Overall, my experience with Sendle was a complete disaster from start to finish.

I am very frustrated as it's been 2.5 weeks and my international parcels are still sitting somewhere \"Arrived at depot, awaiting collection by international provider.\" When I contact sendle about it, it's always the same answer that they're waiting for their provider to scan the parcels. They say anything else. I will never use them again!! I could've saved myself the stress of this if I went with another company.

Went through another round of investigation after my complaint requested a call back or contact, but never heard anything back. When I followed up the third time, they suggest I file a theft report for the missing package and seek the seller for compensation. won't take responsibility for wrong delivery of package. their stance is if the courier partner said it was delivered to the right address then it is delivered, regardless of facts. my advice is avoid Sendle.

Rates seem to be less but so does service. On numerous occasions they have not picked up our parcel. Good luck getting in touch with someone as most replies are automated and when a rep does email you they just make excuses but done guarantee anything.

The tracking number is internal and means nothing.  Updates are hilarious and complete guesses, out for delivery doesn't actually mean you are getting your parcel that day,  just means it's possibly on a truck somewhere on the planet.  It's so bad you start wondering if the business you bought the product from is just a scam.Date of experience: December 03, 2023AdvertisementB Somerville1 reviewAUMay 15, 2024I wish I could give zero starsI wish I could give zero stars. I’ve sent over 700 packages with sendle. They constantly lose packages and make it impossible to get the insurance money for it. Constant hoops to jump through. Furthermore, they will charge huge random penalties for allegedly ‘oversize’ packages without warning from you elected account. I am so furious with them, they need to be shut down. Stick with aus post. Date of experience: May 16, 2024Michael Patton1 reviewAUFeb 26, 2024No oversight on workersPackage was meant to be arriving today but was reported as “damaged”. Speaking to the rep apparently all of their couriers have the authority to mark any package as damaged with no oversight as they “trust their couriers”. They don’t even have to provide a photo! No compensation is then provided to the receiver and the sender is forced to claim on insurance. Totally useless company, avoid at all costs.

Too many drivers just don't care and lack professionalism, useless customer service,  they don't even border reading provided informations. I even provided a map after the first day it was out for delivery without making it to me. My parcel was about to get back to sender for wrong adress even if I confirmed it right 4 times in the previous days. I had to jump through some crazy hoops to have someone call me... because you can't call them, to have them try again by following instructions they had all along. Finally made it a few days late. I really have to admit I really got scared they would just loose the parcel. They might be cheap, but still not worth the money they'll ask you. Keep looking for other options.

My parcel went missing and was eventually declared lost.  What I discovered after numerous attempts to get a non corporate buzz response out of them is their business model in a monumental pile of rubbish.  They do not appear to have alerts built into their systems to advise them when a package hasn't moved for a given period of time.  They have no leverage of the couriers they engage to get a timely response to missing items.I will never use them again and will forever avoid sellers that do use them.Date of experience: December 29, 2023Insta Deals Club1 reviewAUApr 24, 2024Worst service EverWorst service Ever, will NEVER use them again! — I will NEVER use them again.

AFAnna Figiel1 reviewGBNov 10, 2023Intentionally sacrificing goodwill with sneaky cash schemeThis company's unscrupulous practice suggests it may be insolvent. It is currently using an aggressive debt collection agency to raise statutory late payment compensation charges plus interest on historic PAID invoices where the date of payment was even 1 day late - going back as far as 6 years! This is a planned and deliberate cash grab using (and some might say ABUSING) legislation designed to deter genuinely bad payers. Sprint Logistics have taken the nuclear option to screw even long-term customers who paid reliably, for the sake of a few Pounds. They must need this more than goodwill or reputation, so watch out if you've ever done business with them. Date of experience: November 10, 2023Reply from sprintlogistics.comUpdated Mar 1, 2024Hello.

Initially, they projected trustworthiness and customer-oriented service, but over time, deceptive practices came to light. The company seemed focused on squeezing more money out of unsuspecting clients, which eroded trust and fairness in their business dealings.One concerning aspect is their tendency to inflate the number of pallet fees per week, seemingly driven solely by profit-seeking motives. Additionally, charging the same pick and handling fee for both regular B2B orders and the collection of \"expired\" products destined for destruction, lacked transparency and fairness.When I tried to terminate our collaboration, they insisted I was still under contract from four years ago, forcing me to give a three-month notice period. This tactic appeared to extend our collaboration and cost me an additional £255 in Managing Account fees.Furthermore, they billed us weekly pallet fees for three months, even after the stock in question had been removed. This demonstrated their financial desperation and willingness to resort to any means possible to gain more money.Potential clients should exercise extreme vigilance when dealing with Sprint Logistics. Scrutinize billing statements, challenge dubious charges, and be cautious of hidden contract terms.Let this review serve as a stark reminder to remain vigilant and protect yourself from unscrupulous practices.\"Date of experience: July 26, 2023Reply from sprintlogistics.comMar 1, 2024We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback with us, and we sincerely apologise for any disappointment or inconvenience you've experienced during your four years as our valued customer.We acknowledge that there may have been misunderstandings.

Upper management was unresponsive, customer service was only good from one person. I honestly think they were trying to lose our account!

You are (or were) promoting your partnership with this company. You have close corporate ties. You field dozens if not hundreds of complaints every week from people who are being taken advantage of. Your phone menus are actually designed around dealing with the blowback you get. You know exactly the game they are playing and are actively playing a role in supporting it. ———This company proudly represents a known predatory diet scam aimed at teenage girls perpetrated by one Karsten Kjoss and his company, Norwegian Lab. They proudly promote press releases celebrating their partnership.And it must be very profitable for Arvato, because it causes enough problems for them that they re-designed their telephone menu to deal with the influx of angry victims.If you work at this company – PLEASE LEAVE. Resign today. You should sleep better at night working almost anywhere else.If you were thinking of working here – DON'T. No amount of money can be worth it when it's paid for by the suffering of ill adults and children who have been sold a lie about the importance of being thin - about how to become and stay thin. All lies.If you work here you are supporting that lie and you are profiting from it.

We all start projects that we eventually lose interest in and forget about. Almost every web hosting company on the planet wants you to set up a recurring subscription, usually using a debit card. If your debit card expires or is cancelled, you web hosting won't be renewed.Not with 1&1. 1&1 will still keep your contracts going with them for as long as they can (forever even) if you don't cancel them. Even if they have no payment details from you. That's where Arvato come in. They use Arvato to try and scare you into paying for services that you don't actually have to pay for. Infact, I actually had contact from 1&1 live chat which said I was under no legal obligation to pay for the web-hosting that was renewed by them, but not used.That does not stop Arvato from harrassing me. Calling me with robotic voices, texting me sometimes twice a day. A few letters also. I have more than enough money to pay Arvato, but they won't see a penny of it. It's not even a big amount. I was actually gullible and stupid enough to pay Arvato for my 1&1 contract that was automatically renewed in the past, thinking that was the end of it. However 1&1 still kept renewing it even though I believed it was finally cancelled. I couldn't even have access to my 1&1 account anymore as they deleted it.Arvato who are in partnership with 1&1 are extorting people. It's likely illegal and I'm assuming authorities will be investigating it. If not now then in the future.Obviously, you will always expect these types of companies to have very low ratings online. Nobody likes a debt collection agency. However these are the most immoral and questionable ones I've been the target of and I'd advise anybody being harrassed by them to NOT PAY A PENNY.Date of experience: November 26, 2019Reply from ArvatoJan 10, 2020This review is not regarding Arvato in Denmark.

I thought expensive might mean better service. Couldn’t be further from the truth. They treat their customers like trash. Please if you read this do not use them. You will be treated badly, overcharged and poor service for handling shipment problems. The worst of all would be their treatment of the customer / their client. Stay well away.Edit:Thank you for the “sorry” left a whole week after I left the review for everyone to see. Which is great representation of your customer service generally. It would be a great world if we could just say sorry and there be no repercussions to our actions. Thanks for the sorry I’ll treasure it along with the wasted time it took me to read it and write this. Edit to your last reply:Haha 😂 you’re a joke. The typical problem with you and emphasized again by that weak response! Something wrong with replying on here? Something wrong with actually communicating with the customer and asking them first! 😂 I would have given you the answers you needed should you have asked. Stop making excuses for your incompetence.

They are irresponsible, and their response times are unacceptable for managing an Amazon Seller account. As intermediaries, they lack direct contact with contractors, causing huge delays. Moreover, they disappear for weeks without responding to requests, putting my account at risk. Neither they nor their contractors seem to care about their clients.Additionally, many of their 5-star reviews, especially the ones with long descriptions, appear to be fake.

First things first: the dashboard is very similar to Amazons website (Seller Central), so it will not take a lot of time to learn how to use it. It is not overcomplicated, which really is a big plus considering that we are people that do not have a lot of time.You will also get an onboarding that really pays off. The onboarding team is great, they will support your journey with everything they have, questions get answered pretty fast and you really have somebody you can count on. Last but not least the fulfillment itself. The costs are lower than for example amazons. You have the option to provide your own packaging material. Branding is also possible when having byrd as a partner. For me personally the byrd option to change your parcel services daily and always using the one with the lowest cost, is the best experience.All in all I really enjoy byrd as a business partner.

All steps were very well explained and accompanied by constant assistance from our responsible Marc Klein. Marc supported us in every way beyond his actual scope of duties and was the main reason for our positive experience. At this point once again: Thank you Marc!!!When all processes are set up correctly, fulfillment through Byrd works really well and very quickly. However, the communication channels after the onboarding process (and before the offboarding process) are quite complex and lengthy, making quick responses to issues much more difficult. However, these are due to the overall structure of the Byrd system and not the employees. In any case, the team has been very helpful and accommodating.Therefore 7/5 stars for the team and a few deductions for everything else.Date of experience: September 27, 2023Reply from byrdSep 27, 2023Hi Georgios, Thanks a lot for sharing your detailed feedback! We really appreciate it & Marc appreciates the kind words! We're constantly working on improving our services, especially the communication processes and take this feedback seriously. This is why we have already launched initiatives to improve this & already see how this contributes to a better service-level.All the best! GYGigi Yu-Chi3 reviewsGBMay 30, 2024ExcellentOur company has been collaborating with Byrd for about 3 years now. Their system is easy to operate and they have warehouses in different countries. With just one point of contact and one system, we can ship from various countries, which has greatly improved our operational efficiency and saved us a lot of time and resources.During this period, we are very grateful to our account manager, Elena. She is excellent and dedicated. Whenever we encounter problems, she always tries to solve them as quickly as possible, ensuring that our business runs smoothly. Although there was a period of adjustment with Byrd in the beginning, Elena helped us resolve all issues smoothly.We highly recommend Byrd’s services and are very grateful for Elena's constant dedication. Her professionalism and enthusiastic attitude make us confident about our future cooperation.Date of experience: May 30, 2024Reply from byrdJun 3, 2024Thank you so much for your kind words and positive review.

Unresponsiveness at another level.WORST EXPERIENCE. Do not do the same mistake we did: don't keep your goods with byrd. They consistently don't reply to emails and won't give you a phone number. Worse: being fully aware of their lack of customer support, byrd has an automated email sequence for the several weeks' long wait. Never seen this before.We've unfortuntaly been customers for too long and we always hoped the service would get better with the funding rounds. But it doesn't. Most recent example is an urgent bulk shipment that we needed to get out the door to participate in a sales campaign with a new partner. We haven't gotten a reply from byrd until today - except the \"please wait, you will get attended\" automation.Date of experience: October 19, 2021Jordi Llauradó1 reviewITMay 18, 2023Logistics is Ready with our AllianceSince we started the co-operation, we have permanently had a professional but also friendly collaboration in logostics with the people of BYRD.

Sanuku APM Limited6 reviewsHKUpdated Apr 14, 2023Delays in dispatching ordersThere is a ridiculous delay that often occurs with shipping labels. There is no clear explanation from Byrd as to why these delays occur, and they are tardy in dealing with the issues. It sometimes takes several days to clear the order for shipment, and no suitable explanation is ever provided.In response to your reply:Your 97% (dubious) ignores the mistakes your warehouse made with pick and pack, sending wrong items, sending items not ordered or paid for, sending packages so badly packed they don't reach the destination. Your warehouse has been receiving our complaints for the past several months with seemingly no improvement to the service.Date of experience: April 13, 2023Reply from byrdApr 14, 202397% of shipments have been processed without errors in the last 3 months and total we registered 4 delays.

In fact, they are holding our goods. They do not allow us to send in bulk an FBA shipment to amazon or any other b2b shipment (to another prep center or to Amazon directly!) saying that they can't stick the shipping labels and our contract does not contain this rule.. They also refuse to make a UPS pick-up. How can it be that we can't ship our own goods to another prep center or a b2b destination!?   This is a nonsense.

The Byrd portal is user-friendly and well-organized, making it easy to navigate and manage orders. Additionally, our onboarding manager  Marc has always been super friendly and eager to help, which we greatly appreciate.However, there are several areas where Byrd needs improvement. There is often a lack of communication within the team, leading to situations where one person doesn't know what the other is doing. We've encountered several instances where invoices were incorrect, and costs were charged for services that weren't agreed upon. There have also been a few mistakes in the fulfillment process that differed from what was discussed. The internal communication seems slow and inefficient, and there have been times when it felt like we were the first clients of Byrd because simple queries about processes and integrations couldn't be answered.Overall, there's significant room for improvement. We hope to see smoother operations in the future. Many thanks again to our onboarding manager Marc, who was always at our side with his full commitment.Date of experience: June 18, 2024Reply from byrdJun 19, 2024Hi Swenna, Thanks for your detailed feedback.

Do not put your business at RISK. I have read all previous reviews and I'm shocked how I can relate the exact same experience. Onboarding & offboarding went very well with a single point of contact.After onboarding, the nightmare started with the technical support. Extremely slow answer (multiple days to weeks) and sometimes simply no more answer. You need to open a new ticket to remind them to answer.They didn't respect the contract we signed with multiple issues (incorrect carrier, incorrect weight, incorrect charges...). Also not respecting the shipping time frame (all orders before 12:00 will be shipped same day, is simply a false statement). We didn't have an account manager despite the fact we asked multiple times. They ignore. We also asked multiple times a meeting, ignored as well.Finally be aware that BYRD doesn't own anything. They don't own the warehouses and they don't own their shipping label system. They use a third party company - SENDCLOUD. So everytime there is an issue it's either the warehouse or sendcloud and this is why it takes ages to answer or solve the issue.They simply don't care to solve the root cause of their issues. They only try to fix the current problem but it will ultimately repeat again.We stayed there 2 months and left before our trial ends. Thanks god!Date of experience: December 14, 2023ESEsther5 reviewsESOct 1, 2023DON´T PUT YOUR BUSINESS IN RISKTHEY SIMPLY DON´T CARE.Totally disappointed with the service. I accepted to work with them coming from Kubbo, and it was a disaster... They didn´t have a system to really onboard the client correctly, but specially, to follow up with us.There were many problems on the orders but the ticket management was not efficient. We track our team working hours and we spent 2.3x times what we spent with Kubbo.We needed to leave and the offboarding process was a nightmare. They didn´t send it all together, requested for picking charge when the material arrived just as we sent it.Seriously, just don´t do it. This happened in our lowest time when we had 50 orders a month. If it had happened in our highest months with 1000 orders we wouldn´t have been able to follow up with the problems there were and would have lost so mnay clients in the process.CONCLUSION: It´s not worthy to put your business in risk, trust us.Date of experience: July 01, 2023TWTwo Wheels Empire2 reviewsLTApr 3, 2023Amazing service and Amazing experience…Amazing service and Amazing experience working with Byrd warehouse.

Avoid at all costs!We were customers for 2 years had a terrible experience with Byrd. During the off-boarding process, they lost our stock. They refused to provide  provide a packing list, and provided no other proof of what products were sent in the off boarding. Despite their mistake, they refused to take any liability for the lost items (about 900 products to be exact). Even though some of the representatives have been really nice and helpful, it's clear that their service is ineffective and unprofessional from the management team. The fact that they don't own their warehouses means they have no control over what happens to their customers' inventory. We would never recommend working with them to anyone, and strongly advise others to avoid doing business with this company.Update 31st March 2023The last communication we recieved from Byrd was 3rd March 2023, stating that Byrd is rejecting liability. If your stakeholders are truly looking into finding a solution, then we have not been informed. In response to your sentence ''Logistics can be a mess sometimes.'' - Yes this is true, but it's not the response you expect to hear from your 3PL when they lose your stock.Date of experience: March 03, 2023Reply from byrdMar 31, 2023We are truly sorry to hear about your negative experience.

They have an outstanding team of professionals that really help to match the business needs with the best 3PL in network. From our experience, their team always responds quickly to our inquiries and have gone above and beyond to make sure we have everything we need. They offer incredible customer support and are trustworthy with sensitive information. Fulfill is a great partner for 3PL solutions.Date of experience: February 20, 2024Previous1Next pageCompany activitySee allClaimed profileHasn’t replied to negative reviewsAdvertisementAbout Fulfill.comInformation written by the companyFulfill.com - where 3PLs and brands come to scale.\nFulfill.com is an online marketplace built to help companies find the best fulfillment center for their unique business needs. There are over 20,000 fulfillment centers in the US alone, each with services and infrastructure that make them the ideal fit for specific niches. Until the creation of the Fulfill.com marketplace, there was no efficient process or platform for companies and fulfillment centers to connect online, share needs, collect pricing, and interview partner candidates.\nFulfill.com streamlines this search for both fulfillment centers and the businesses they service. Fulfillment centers submit to our network, complete a detailed application for approval, and are analyzed based on hundreds of criteria to determine quality ranking. Once approved, fulfillment centers are listed on our global 3PL directory and introduced to our team of logistics experts to agree on the type of companies they are best suited to service.\nTo ensure we recommend only the most qualified fulfillment centers for a brand, we take several careful steps from brand vetting to 3PL shortlisting and more.\nFulfill.com only lists thoroughly vetted brand RFP submissions. To submit on our marketplace, each brand completes a 3PL Request Form which goes through an extensive verification process to ensure the search is valid and appropriate for our network.\nOnce we have verified and listed a fulfillment center search, our team of logistics experts browses through our network of top-rated 3PLs to find the best match. We only shortlist candidates from our pool of verified fulfillment centers, reviewing their expertise, rates, portfolio and other information to find ones that satisfy the search criteria. Once the best fulfillment center candidates are shortlisted, the Fulfill.com Marketplace team invites them to connect with the brand and carry out their standard discovery process.\nAfter discovery is completed and quotes are submitted, they are compiled into a dashboard for the brand to review, while fulfillment centers are able to review and compare anonymous pricing submitted by other competitors on the project.\nWhile the Fulfill.com team is available for consultation, the final 3PL choice is ultimately that of the brand representatives. After meeting with the potential candidates, the brand will select the winner and Fulfill.com will notify all candidates on the results of the RFP.\nIf you would like to connect with the leading fulfillment centers or list your 3PL on our network, please visit us at fulfill.com and get in touch with our team.Contactteam@fulfill.com1614 E 6th St78702AustinUnited StatesCategoryOnline MarketplacePeople who looked at this company also looked at🇺🇸US Garage Auction Co.™  2ClaimedMansfield Unlimited LLC2ClaimedSwadesii2ClaimedSuggested companies are based on people’s browsing tendencies.The Trustpilot ExperienceWe're open to allAnyone can write a Trustpilot review.

It feels so good to know that as a customer, not only you are not left battling with contact forms and FAQ( however excellent they are) but can speak to someone who will save your work day headache, time and stress. Yes, Huboo is a large company but I can say from experience that there is always someone who cares on the other end of the phone for urgent matters( and tickets are always quickly and efficiently answered); Suzanne and a few other customers service helps are now familiar voices, recognising each other, which makes you feel like Huboo is not working for you but with you.

We have been let down over and over. Latest issue is their b2b service. Over 50% of our orders have either been lost or damaged in transit or have been delivered to the wrong address. But worst of all, Huboo have refused to follow up on orders where Fedex staff have opened our packages, stolen products, repackaged poorly so they arrive damaged even when we have supplied photo evidence. Huboo simply say they did their part and refuse to follow up with Fedex. We are not able to follow up directly with Fedex as it is the Huboo account. Huboo also do not offer protection or cover for b2b orders so we just need to accept the significant financial impact and disgruntled customers, which are hurting us as a small growing business.I wish this was the first issue we had with Huboo but it is not. From being miss-sold in the sales process to changing prices that make the storage costs ridiculous compared to other 3PLs... I have had their head of customer service contact me to discuss ways they can improve which I really appreciated and then stayed with them in the hope they would change... but then when more issues arise, they hide behind the customer service team who inform me I can no longer contact them.

Brilliant individual; make use of him while he is available, because I'm sure he will be going places...Constructively, having a 24/7 (or perhaps longer term than 9:30-4:30), support would go a long way.

There were constant price increases, despite there being info saying this would not happen when we started, WAY above inflation levels. We pushed back on this, but only once we left a negative review they contacted us and said they'd get rid of the price increase if we deleted the review. Check the Google reviews for a fair representation of their business. There also seemed to be a lot of incorrect orders, and our stock numbers on Shopify were frequently off despite updating this regularly. The final straw was a minimum price cap of £650 with less than a months notice, something that came completely out the blue and had the potential to massively harm our business going into the busiest time of year. They completely knew what they were doing with this timing and unfortunately they have previous. A money grabbing company that had potential to be great unfortunately. Their platform is also not particularly user friendly and not worth the increased price on others, avoid.Date of experience: October 02, 2024Reply from Huboo Technologies Oct 14, 2024We’re sorry to hear you’re unhappy with the service you've received.

We're sorry to hear you've been disappointed with your experience. The adjustment to Huboo’s minimum billing policy is designed to ensure we can continue offering the level of service and strategic support our clients rely on. As with any fulfilment business, we dedicate a significant amount of time and money to onboard and manage each of our clients’ orders, so this minimum billing simply helps to ensure that our monthly costs are covered and can be reinvested. I'm aware the team have reached out to you to discuss this and the other issues you raised, so please do let us know how we can help going forward.HRHristo1 reviewGBMay 24, 2024With Huboo, you don't just get a fulfilment provider, you also get a partner next to you.Marta from the onboarding team and Lydia from the IT support were outstanding!

It's been a mistake that I wouldn't recommend someone else to follow. Firstly, they gave us rates that turned out to good to be true. With pricing that they wanted to increase with a significant amount soon after we onboarded, cut-off times they never realized and a poor customer service. Usually, I'm not one to write bad reviews, but I'd highly recommend you to refrain from working with Huboo.Date of experience: November 10, 2023OLIVIEREWILSON 2 reviewsGBJun 19, 2024Highly recommend!

We are small to medium e-commerce company, selling D2C and B2B to retailers.Shipbob has great software which is slick and easy to use but beyond that the service they deliver is a joke. Their fulfilment centres are not owner or operated by Shipbob meaning everything becomes a huge cumbersome, slow issue. Their pricing & billing is purposely unclear, vague and borderline deceiving. If you need support or a quick question, forget it. No-one ever online on the live chat, no-one answers the phone, email support takes over 24 hours to get back to you. I won't detail our full horrid experience as it's not worth the time but simply put, if you are considering Shipbob, I can't strongly enough recommend that you look elsewhere & avoid this company.Date of experience: October 30, 2024Jeff Germenis1 reviewUSOct 30, 2024Truly ProfessionalThe setup and integrations were completely handled by ShipBob to not add any stress to my company.

A 3PL operation that is the size of ShipBob's is inevitably going to have hiccups, some bigger than others. Every single time we have had an issue Lauren has revolved it efficiently and professionally. She is very \"on the ball\", and is an excellent communicator. If I am being entirely honest, I would rate ShipBob a 3.5 star and Lauren a 5 star. My only complaint with ShipBob is that it doesn't feel intimate enough for my liking, but Lauren has filled that gap for me.

Some areas of improvement: Probably not totally SB fault but some of the shipping tracking issues, especially when you're not using a courier (UPS/Fedex etc), have posed some challenges for us when dealing with our customers.

The sales team provided misleading quotes that left us with unexpected fees, their check in times for booking stock are around a week to get stock on the shelf and they drained our budget from the start. Worse still, a significant portion of our stock went missing, causing major disruptions and financial losses.Trying to get any assistance has been futile. Their customer support is incredibly poor and practically non-existent. Emails go unanswered, and when you do get a response, it’s unhelpful and slow. ShipBob has not only failed to meet their promises but has also severely impacted our business operations.Avoid ShipBob at all costs if you value your time, money, and inventory.Date of experience: October 01, 2024Reply from ShipBobOct 2, 2024We are so sorry to hear this.

The first was a small sectional and we delivered fast and without issue.  The others were 2 matching recliner leather sofas.  One was supposed to be a loveseat with 2 recliners, the other a 3 seater sofa where the ends recline and a middle seat that doesn't recline.  What I received were 2 right side recliners, 1 left side recliner and 2 middle pieces.  I'm missing a left side recliner and no one will respond to my support inquiry after over a week and multiple contact attempts.  It now appears their support chat feature is gone from the website, and other than sending emails, I'm at a loss.  My media room is incomplete, and I'm out thousands of dollars with no recourse.  Terrible company!Date of experience: July 11, 2023Alex Paniagua1 reviewUSUpdated Jul 27, 2023Absolutely AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTSAbsolutely AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS. I have never had such a terrible and stressful experience with any company in my entire life. I ordered a couch off of Burrow's outlet site (which I did NOT know was operated through a third-party distributor) and 5 weeks later, my order was still \"being processed.\" When I reached out to clarify what was going on, a FloorFound employee said, \"Whoops, the system marked your order at the wrong location. Sorry about that, all fixed!\" Not even an attempt at any remediation, and then another 3 weeks go by and the SAME THING HAPPENS. Somehow they managed to put in the system that it was sending from the wrong location TWICE. It has now been over 9 weeks since I placed my order. Not only has it not even shipped yet, I can't even get a response regarding what's going on at this point or whether I have a new tracking link since my last two both just say \"Order Canceled.\" How on earth can a company be allowed to run this way? The only reason I even want my couch anymore at this point is so this awful experience can finally be over. I don't care how much of a discount you think you're getting on some name-brand furniture, just buy it directly from the actual company. I promise the hassle and headache you'll experience from this operation is not worth a few hundred dollars in savings. I don't think I'd want to put up with this anymore if they tried to give me my order for free.EDIT: After 10 weeks, they lost my order. All that time wasted. Absolute garbage company.Date of experience: July 23, 2023DMDominic McCamish4 reviewsUSMay 1, 2023Everything worked out!I took a risk on Floorfound - I read the reviews here first, but decided to try anyway, so I had low expectations going in. I ordered two Burrow couches (normal Nomad and a King Nomad with chases). It took several weeks for them to show up, and then the legs were missing from the King Nomad - though everything that arrived was in perfect condition. I contacted customer service, who appear to be short-handed. They were still quite helpful, and after a couple weeks found the legs and hardware that were missing. Those arrived, and now I have two great couches for MUCH less than retail! So in summary: It took a long time and there was a shipping hiccup, but if you are patient, it is well worth it.Date of experience: January 30, 2023NINiki2 reviewsUSJan 1, 2023Pleasantly SurprisedAfter reading the bad reviews, I was reluctant to purchase from FloorFound ... the price of the normally $3k sofa was too good so I decided to give it a chance anyway (paying w credit card for extra protection). I ordered the couch the day after Thanksgiving, it was labeled as \"like new\" with no damages noted. Fast forward a week later and I begin to panic as I've not received any updates. Evidently it had already shipped but the system failed to update me. The delivery window was 4-6 weeks so was incredibly surprised to have them schedule a delivery with me for December 12. (For scale, I live in Chicago and the warehouse was located in NJ)No problems with the delivery, the couch was missing a charging piece which FloorFound promptly sent a replacement for. Overall, A+ couch, A+ customer service (they always replied quickly and accommodated all my requests), and FAST delivery. Maybe I'm the outlier here but I'm glad I took a chance.Date of experience: December 14, 2022CACarol Ann1 reviewUSApr 2, 2023UnfortunateMy first purchase from them was great. However, I was going to make my second purchase from them but when I tried to check out, it added $100 on to shipping after I added a promo code. They tried to claim that I must have changed what was in my cart, but I only had 1 item in my cart so nice try, but no. The next day I thought I would give it another try and surprise surprise the promo code no longer worked even though it didn't have an expiration date in my email. I would rather pay more than buy from them. It is really unfortunate too because I have an entire home to furnish and I love their concept of buying returns but I will be taking my business elsewhere.Date of experience: April 01, 2023Emily Schultz1 reviewUSFeb 7, 2023DO NOT ORDER FROM HEREDO NOT ORDER FROM HERE! My friend is a frontline worker just trying to relax after strenuous shifts literally nursing children back to health in the pediatrics department of a hospital in Brooklyn. She ordered a couch from Floorfound in OCTOBER. It's currently FEBRUARY and she still doesn't have 1 piece of her couch. Not only did she have to take THREE shifts off of work to wait for the delivery drivers who brought the wrong piece THREE TIMES, but their customer service has been incredibly rude and unprofessional. Imagine if the world operated like Floorfound does? Nothing would get done. Save yourself.Date of experience: February 07, 2023JNJennifer Nehrenz2 reviewsUSMar 17, 2023Buyer bewareBuyer beware: make sure you’ve triple checked the photos and item description. They do not accept returns or exchanges. I bought two chairs with walnut wood details. One of the two chairs arrived in white oak, not walnut. The description said walnut, but the photos of the chair were photos of an oak chair. Even though it was a discrepancy on their site and my invoice clearly stated walnut, they would not exchange or refund.Date of experience: March 16, 2023BRBridget2 reviewsUSMar 13, 2023Prompt and Accurate OrderI was apprehensive about ordering from Floor Found given others' reviews here, however I decided to take the risk and actually ended up having a great experience. My order came from the Perth Amboy, NJ warehouse and I received my order within about 2 weeks of purchase (delivered to California). Delivery and communications from the fulfillment company were prompt, clear, and accurate, and my couch was exactly as described (like new condition). I also received very prompt and friendly responses from Floor Found customer service when I had a question about billing, so I was pleased with that element as well.I don't doubt that others had bad experiences, but with my experience being as good as it was it sounds like Floor Found has major inconsistencies between warehouses, fulfillment/shipping companies, and quality control for inspection of items. For what it's worth, I'm really happy with my order!Date of experience: March 13, 2023Jackie T.1 reviewUSDec 13, 2022How can this company be allowed to do business!Same experience as the others with one star reviews. There should be a zero star option. Buyer beware! All same issues. Missing pieces, undisclosed damage, terrible communication, months of delays, but hands down the WORST thing is the companies unethical business practices. Absolutely the worst client experience!!! Still resolving 3 months later. Had to go to my bank.Date of experience: October 01, 2022JSJudah Sebastian1 reviewUSNov 29, 2022This is the worst company I have ever…This is the worst company I have ever worked with.DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY, unless you like to burn money, wait 2-3 months for your items to be shoddily delivered, have said deliveries be incomplete (missing items) or just flat out wrong. All this happened to me multiple times, and the support is extremely slow, unresponsive and unhelpful. This company deserves to be bankrupt and I just hope I can convince at least one person to not use this service.Date of experience: November 29, 2022WAWhitney Alt2 reviewsUSJan 8, 2023Terrible service & badly damaged sofa = 'as new'Terrible service, badly damaged product sold 'as new'.Delivered weeks late.Hide behind dubious terms and conditions, don't use them - you will regret it. Check out he other reviews.....Date of experience: December 22, 2022Read 1 more review about floorfound.comJEJenna4 reviewsUSJun 28, 2023Double Check the \"Deals\"While there may be some deals, my experience left me feeling that not everything is as it seems.I was interested in a rug that was $4,500 marked down to $875 by a brand called 'French Coastal'. I wanted to read some reviews and understand the quality and the process that made this rug more expensive that some designer rugs I had seen.I'm already familiar with other brands on their website such as Burrow, Castelry and assumed this company must be similar.After googling French Coastal I realised that this \"brand\" only exists on their website. There's zero trace of it online.After speaking with Sasheika on their chat function they confirmed that French Coastal is in fact their OWN brand.When I enquired further about what made this rug, a rug by their own brand, a whopping $4,500 to begin with, the reply was that \"pricing was not their department\", with no offer to put me through to someone whos department it is.Since Floorfound deals in recommerce I asked if they might have a link to this rug at it's Full Price so that I might try to understand where the $4,500 price tag came from and was told that they are only authorized to talk about items on their website.Since this is their own brand, I found it strange that they could not give me any further information on this item. After much back and forth and talking around my line of enquiry I very much began to feel that this rug probably has never been $4,500, it's probably never been sold anywhere at $4,500 and it made me doubt that $875 is even a good deal for it.I felt that the \"deal\" was perhaps misrepresented and decided not to purchase on this occasion. If I were to purchase it would be from one of the brands that actually exist so that I could verify quality and fair pricing.Date of experience: June 27, 2023GRGretchen1 reviewUSDec 17, 2022They are horribleThey are horrible.  The vast majority of the pieces had undisclosed damages or were wrong.  You cannot communicate with anyone there.  Best of all when the last piece in my order came mangled not usable and wrong they sent a refund (leaving me one piec short of a sectional) and offered to let me buy an exchange from their site for $600 more.  I am convinced they sell inventory knowing it is wrong and customers have no recourse to return it.Date of experience: December 17, 2022JWJohn Williamson1 reviewUSNov 11, 2022BUYER BEWARE! False advertisingThe company repeatedly lied about delivery times after charging an exorbitant amount for delivery. At 5 weeks after my order, they do not know where my item is, when it will be delivered, and have offered me 75% of my money back, charging 25% for restocking something they cannot even find. They refuse to respond to emails or complaints.Date of experience: November 11, 2022JHJH1 reviewUSJan 15, 2023Deceptive listingsI really like the concept but unfortunately I feel like my experience with this company echoes that of others.I purchased a sofa that was pictured in boxes with only the description “No issues found during inspection.” It showed up dirty with stains and absolutely covered in dark pet hair that I can’t get off. Their response is that some issues slip by the inspectors and the solution is for me to just to clean it. Okay fine, it’s probably cleanable, but I would not have bought the couch if they had accurate pictures or description of the condition of it. I wouldn’t have bought a dirty couch. Seems like kind of a crapshoot of what you will actually get. Some people get lucky but most don’t.Date of experience: January 15, 2023EJEmmy Jon1 reviewUSApr 4, 2023This company didn’t deliver the full…This company didn’t deliver the full furniture pieces and only has a chat service.  Firstly, this is a company local to me. I was hoping for great things and rooting for them. I love their company mission and was hoping the reviews were from grouchy people. I should have believed the reviews on this company. Even Outer said what an awful company they were when asked about buying through them. The first part of my order wasn’t fully delivered. The second time to fix the first part, the wrong cushion was sent. I was told I could source my own replacement and when I told them the cost to replace the part from the original company, they refused to pay.  Instead, I was ordered an entire chair replacement that I would be in charge of recycling.  It defeats the purpose of their core mission. This could be an amazing company, but it is absolutely horrible. Christopher doesn’t follow up and didn’t offer anything for bri g outside of delivery schedule quotes of $499. Kat did follow up and tried to make things right before the second error was made. She tried, but the shipping companies and floorfound do not communicate with each other. Do not buy from this company until they figure out their quality control.Date of experience: April 03, 2023KPKate Prinz4 reviewsUSSep 9, 2022I ordered a piece of furniture from…floorfoundI ordered a piece of furniture from them in early June. It is September 8th and I have not received it. They are nonresponsive, barely answering the emails. They have a low rate shipping company that lost the piece and they claim they are looking for it. This was an expensive piece of furniture and I’m not sure I’m even going to get it. Avoid this company they are absolutely horrible.Date of experience: September 08, 2022JUjuliag3 reviewsUSJan 11, 2023Ordered two chairs, got one.Ordered two chairs, only one was delivered. Their logistics partner, Metropolitan Warehouse, cancelled multiple deliveries without notifying me. Eventually, they sent the second chair back to the warehouse, noted that I had \"refused the delivery\" and closed the order. FloorFound support has been intermittently responsive but has no resolution - just that they're reaching out to Metropolitan Warehouse. I had two previous orders with FloorFound that went well, but after this experience I won't be using them again. The chairs I ordered are now on sale with the original retailer with free 3-5 day shipping and a lower price than FloorFound's. Order at your own risk and expect to stay on top of Metropolitan Warehouse via phone email and tracking links to make sure they actually bring you the items they paid for. You'd think paying $300 for shipping would actually get your items delivered, but apparently it's not. In the future I'd just wait for a sale from the original retailer. FloorFound is a great concept but executed poorly - not worth the trouble.Date of experience: December 22, 2022WGWarren Gunn3 reviewsUSJan 27, 2023Great when you actually receive your…Great when you actually receive your item, but too inconsistent to be worth the hassle. I needed to place a large furniture order after having all of my belongings stolen by a moving company and figured it would be worth it to save some money by buying used, but my god, what a nightmare.1. The first item, a nightstand from Burrow, arrives still flat-packed in the box. Appears to have been a brand new item that someone just didn't like, but after taking out all of the pieces to being assembly, I find that I have two left sides instead of a left and right side, can't actually assemble the stand. I reach out to Floor Found about getting a replacement piece, but Burrow can't ship a single piece, so I literally have to toss this in the trash, though Floor Found does refund me the purchase price and shipping costs.2. I order three (3) pieces of sectional from Floyd. Though I order them at the same time, I get the ottoman right away but wait weeks for the other pieces, only to be told that first, the left side of the sectional is not in the condition as described and is (in their words) \"not suitable for sale\", so they find another one of similar quality that I eventually get a few weeks later. The right side somehow gets \"lost when they moved warehouses\", but they find me another one in similar condition. I wait a few more weeks only to be told that oops! They accidentally already sold this to someone, and their website didn't update in time. They have no other similar pieces, so I now have half a sectional.3. The dining table I ordered appears to have been handed off to Metro Delivery, but I keep getting told that it's not at the local hub and that they'll reach out to me when it is. Finally, a week after I check the tracking information and see that it has (allegedly) been sitting in their local warehouse, I call Metro only to find out that Floor Found canceled the \"ticket\" (whatever that means) and that they don't have this item, so queue reaching out to Floor Found AGAIN to figure out what's going on.4. I'm still waiting on a media console that has now taken almost three months to be shipped, after which, I don't think I'll ever order from Floor Found again, which is unfortunate, because it's a great idea, but it's just too inconsistent and poorly managed to be worth it.Date of experience: January 27, 2023Previous12Next pageCompany activitySee allClaimed profileContactUnited StatesPeople who looked at this company also looked atSnapl0ClaimedTrack My Visa Now205Asking for reviewsRedbooks5UnclaimedSuggested companies are based on people’s browsing tendencies.The Trustpilot ExperienceWe're open to allAnyone can write a Trustpilot review.

The complaints you read are real and I wish I would have believed them. Just do yourself a favor and pay more at your local furniture store. It will save you the headache of missing pieces of your order, fighting for your refund and not getting your shipping costs back which in my case was $500. Or how they say their shipping timeframe can be used as an excuse that all your order didn't arrive together because it's lost???So if you happen to receive your order and take off work and parts are missing they aren't responsible. For reference this is a sectional and only 3 of the 5 parts were on the delivery truck! From FloorFound: following up with you on your order that was missing pieces. Since your order was placed on January 14, 2023, and we quote a delivery timeframe of 6-8 weeks, management is not granting permission to proceed with a full refund at this time.The next step will be to request a Dock Search to be performed at the warehouse so all 5 of the boxes containing the Harper Sectional may be located and delivered to you. This can take up to 7-10 business days to complete, but please rest assured, we will do our best to still get this to you within the quoted timeframe for delivery.BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!

It is small parcel size £3.39 with Tracked 48. The Rip off Rebound 'portal' gave me a royal mail drop off option of £6.20 and an InPost locker drop off option of £7.10. If you can pay £3.39 as a consumer for a tracked and picked up service, just imagine how little they actually pay with bulk discounts. I had to phone NBA and request the return address so I could send it myself without being ripped off by Rebound. Yet another example of corporates exploiting the consumer for all they can get and no regulation to prevent them.Date of experience: July 01, 2024Reply from ReBoundJul 18, 2024I'm sorry to hear that you are frustrated with the returns experience.

So works awful in the Netherlands. I also don’t know if they will take my package seeing other people on this platform saying they won’t accept a rebound code.Update after comment below: I did contact my retailer they gave me different options if I put in my correct order number and personal details. I did and tried numerous times and even videotaped it. And checked if there were nog extra spaces etc. It still didn’t work, my retailer helped me and put in my return manually. But Rebound is awful and can never find your order.

The value of the parcels is £850 and they were sent on 24 June. The update says received by the carrier on 26 June and then nothing. They are always slow but this is ridiculous and very stressful. Also not impressed with the customer service from River Island. I have been told I have to wait another 7 days to even find out what is happening. This is crazy when they have bar codes for tracking!

Due to Christmas and the pandemic, every logistics company is under enormous pressure, so things can take a little longer than usual. For assistance with your return, you'll need to contact the retailer you purchased from directly, and they should be able to help and get your refund sorted for you.Thanks,The ReBOUND TeamPJPaul Jordan1 reviewGBDec 30, 2022Do they even exist?Paid over £7 for the no printer easy peasy return service. Machine at BP Garage outlet hadn't worked for ages said the disinterested staff. Searched online for another outlet. Nada. Zilch. Zero. Clowns.Date of experience: December 30, 2022EJEm Jay2 reviewsGBUpdated Nov 1, 2021ReBOUND Returns - do not useWould give ZERO STARS if possible. I have checked the box to notify ReBOUND Returns but nothing has triggered a response so I doubt this would. Why would any retailer risk their brand with this company?  I have paid for a return of a Chelsea FC order, was sent a useless barcode with no instructions and which no courier or parcel shop will accept. All my attempts to contact Rebound have failed, so I have written off my fee to Rebound as online fraud. I have asked the retailer to provide an alternative route to return the order.Date of experience: November 01, 2021HSHeather Smithson12 reviewsGBApr 17, 2023Absolutely awful companyAbsolutely awful company. Unfortunately the football club that I support uses this company to deliver club shop products. They charge outrageous postage costs plus a “handling” fee!! When you return something they are supposed to refund your postage but you have to chase this. The link on their returns page takes you to Fantatics which is based in USA and the UK numbers given for customer service are wrong! You cannot ever speak to anyone and the chat bot is (surprise surprise) totally useless. All in all it’s just the worst experience dealing with this company and I shall be making my thoughts known to the powers that be at Aston Villa.Date of experience: April 17, 2023BDBD1 reviewGBFeb 2, 2023Would give no stars if possibleWould give no stars if possible. Like all the other reviews this is undoubtedly the WORST returns service. The bar code provided is not recognised by any of the mainstream couriers I have wasted my time visiting and I have no idea where to take the item for return. Paid for this non service. Any company using this service is risking future orders.Date of experience: February 02, 2023Reply from ReBoundFeb 3, 2023Hi There, Sorry to hear you're having difficulty with your return.

According to their tracking, the items are still in transit, and then the scam company that I brought the item from Cernucci says it's nothing to do with them and can't do anything until the item has been returned. I would personally advise to stay well and truly clear of both companies.Date of experience: July 14, 2022Sarah Hurrell2 reviewsGBAug 15, 2023DO NOT USEMy ASOS account wouldn’t generate me a return for an order, so they manually created one using ReBound. I dropped this off at the local Post Office, and was told I’d receive an email confirmation. This was on the 2nd of August, and I am yet to receive any sort of confirmation. I’ve contacted ASOS who haven’t received the order, and have told me they can’t help me any further as they need a proof of return. When I try and check the tracking with ReBound it comes up with an error page. I’m now £399 down.. top tip - if ASOS give you a returns label using ReBound refuse to use it!!!!

Their main website is so convincing and immaculately dressed up to easily fool customers. Rebound is just a fake brand that steals your money without giving yiu what you paid for. No QR code provided. No customer service and just pass on the baton to the retailer. I won't even bother request for a refund as I don't want to drop my standard. My advice do not use their service at all cost even if it the cheapest option. You will look like a fool in the shop when dropping your items.Date of experience: April 25, 2022JAJay3 reviewsGBOct 8, 2022awfulAbysmal, no information provided on a return location, after initial return process completed.

It seems in this instance, you selected Collect+, so the item will have needed to be taken to any Collect+ location. We're sorry if this process was not clear, and we'll be sure to give this feedback to the team.

Please avoid choosing this company for your business. They took my money and refused to give me a full refund.

I reached out to cancel and requested a refund, but they ignored my request and continued to charge me.

It still hasn't printed and customer service seems to have no idea why or when it may. They have refused to refund. We were told our boxes would print the week of 10/18 and they are still in que. We wanted these items for holiday shipping and have sourced elsewhere (they were able to perform). Arka wants no accountability and taking money and not delivering is unacceptable. There are too many small businesses like us that need vendors who can perform when paid. Watch out as they seem to be taking money and not delivering.

Hope to work with you again!NINick1 reviewUSMar 19, 2021Ongoing NightmareTldr: Do not use this company. They wasted 8 weeks of our time and money, lost our order, refused to take ownership, blamed everyone but themselves and used our phone number from our order [without our permission] to contact us about another customer’s lost order that was sent to us instead of the correct destination. 2 stars because we received a refund and the samples were nice, but overall the experience was a nightmare and a huge waste of time and money. ------------Where to even start with the full story. I guess I will start with a positive because there is only one. The samples we ordered from Arka turned out beautiful. Mainly because of the design we created, but the print quality was also good so we will give them that. One important thing to note [something we didn’t find out until our boxes were lost] is that Arka is just a nice website interface - they outsource everything. Despite taking 7 weeks to receive our 10 sample boxes & not receiving a tracking email until 3 days after our samples arrived (I will also mention that the “tracking”  email did not include an actual tracking number or link - we should have taken that as a sign), we decided to move forward with placing our full order.We placed our full order on January 4, 2021. On January 25th we received an email saying my order was preparing to ship & some questions to answer to coordinate delivery. We responded immediately & followed up a few days later asking for a tracking number at which time Arka responded saying providing a delivery date was not possible and once they had tracking information available they would provide it to us.On February 7th (10 business days after being originally contacted about our order being prepared to ship) we followed up again with Arka because they had still not provided a tracking number. Finally, after having to loop in the owner to our email, we received a tracking number on February 11. The tracking number stated our estimated delivery date was February 11 - the same day we received “tracking” but the link Arka provided had NO tracking history. So, we had no idea where our order actually was.We noticed a freight logo on my tracking so we reached out to that company directly. That company told us they handed over the shipment to another company so we called that company only to find out that due to a logistical error, our shipment had been placed on hold & had been sitting for TEN days. Something we could have looked into sooner if Arka had provided a tracking number, but instead we lost another 10 days.We contacted Arka again at which time they told us it was a weather/COVID delay, which we knew was a lie since we had email proof stating the logistical error from their vendor causing the shipment to be cancelled and ultimately put on hold.A million calls and emails later [with no help from Arka], we were finally able to release the hold on February 15 & received a new ETA of February 24-26 (TWENTY BUSINESS DAYS after our order allegedly shipped) . On February 22, after our tracking hadn’t updated in TWENTY days and no one had contacted us to coordinate delivery we recontacted the freight company who told us our order was lost (after spending HOURS on the phone).We wasted EIGHT WEEKS, thousands of dollars on boxes, thousands of dollars on the delay of our launch of our business and thousands of dollars in rent/ingredients for our kitchen space because we were fooled by a pretty website interface and chose to work with Arka.The crazy part is this story doesn’t even end with OUR lost boxes. On March 10th we received hundreds of someone else’s boxes. Not wanting someone else to go through what we did, we personally reached out to the other company to tell them that we received their boxes. After them not hearing back from Arka, we personally contacted the printing facility Arka uses and coordinated a pick up for redelivery.THEN at 5:30pm on a Friday after we didn’t respond to an email from Arka because we had already scheduled a pick up for their other customer, we got a text from Arka’s owner blaming FedEx for the lost boxes. Not only do we find it completely inappropriate for him to use our phone number from our order to contact us without our permission, he still didn’t accept responsibility for the lost order - he blamed FedEx. FedEx didn’t lose the order, Arka did! The other company’s order was delivered to exactly who it was addressed to… US.In full transparency, the owner contacted us again on March 18th (2.5 months after we placed our order & a month plus after losing our order) offering 50 free boxes and blog post to make it up to us. We declined his offer because it was too late to try and “make it up to us” as we had already encountered too many losses because of Arka. We also did not feel comfortable with Arka promoting our business when we do not support theirs.Date of experience: March 19, 2021Reply from ArkaJan 24, 2024Hope we can win you back!

Introvabili e-mail di qualsiasi genere. Esiste una chat incompetente che ti rimanda a qualche agente che non richiama. Altrimenti ti devi infilare nel coacervo delle varie FAQ con risposte precostituite che non contemplano mai i reclami. Come fosse tutto rose e fiori e l'azienda immacolata. Questa è un'azienda arrogante, ha un atteggiamento dispotico che forse si può permettere solo in Italia. Non credo che in altri Paesi europei e mondiali e nemmeno in Spagna da dove proviene, gli sia permesso di esercitare questa arrogante posizione dominante in tutta tranquillità. In conclusione: per sporgere un reclamo devi scrivere una raccomandata all Sede spagnola (spendendo 10 euro), i quali non ti rispondono dopo 1 mese. Pertanto Auctane si arroga il diritto di sbagliare e mandarti una fattura fasulla, per la quale non hai usufruito di un servizio, e poi non mette a disposizione degli utenti i mezzi per richiedere un rimborso.

Additionally we found Cahoot was one of the only 3PLs that let you utilize your own warehouses in addition to their network. Once everything is setup correctly, the software automates shipping by location and price. Another great thing about Cahoot is the potential to become part of their network if you have excess warehouse space and can ship per their requirements and your location expands their network effectively.Date of experience: September 26, 2024Read 1 more review about CahootAdvertisementRahul Singhal2 reviewsINSep 18, 2024Great Internship ExperienceMy internship at Cahoot was a truly transformative experience. From the outset, I was entrusted with high-impact projects that directly influenced the company's operational efficiency. What made the experience exceptional was the high level of responsibility and ownership I was given. I wasn’t just an intern; I was a key contributor, constantly solving critical challenges and streamlining processes that enhanced performance. The team's mentorship was invaluable, providing clear direction while empowering me to take initiative and make meaningful decisions.Date of experience: June 20, 2024Russ Girior1 reviewUSJul 25, 2024RedirectedAbsolute con artist companyAbsolute con artist company. They will lead you on with constant promises of all the savings they will get you, but once you sign up you find out all the things needed to actually update your inventory programmatically all cost extra and that savings somehow involve you sending truck loads of inventory. They don't tell you everything has to be done manually through your side down to actually adding available inventory from their warehouse to sellercentral. Once we figured this out, they had our inventory and wanted us to pay $200,000 in monthly fees to buy out our contract that wasn't even a month old. We hadn't even sold $500 yet, and they held less than 10k in inventory. When we pointed out that they failed to meet even basic obligations for a company our size, that all fulfilment and even receiving cost were MORE than what we were already paying, they responded that they needed more time and that they met all responsibilities. Don't waste your time with this bait and switch company. There only concern is roping you in and milking you to get out.

The training for sending out shipments on behalf of other sellers was seamless. Easy label generation, printing, and packing. It's a breeze for the warehouse crew. They provide all the resources you would need for the outgoing side of a 3PL system. This experience caused us to explore shipping out our own units to other nodes in their network.

First, Cahoot software and platform is miles ahead of the other leading shipping solutions on the market because they’ve designed it from the ground up with today’s fulfillment needs in mind. We save hours daily since we switched. Second, their customer service is highly responsive and competent and they focus on resolving issues quickly. Happy to report that there really aren’t many issues but it’s good to know that the Cahoot team is there to help us when we need. Cahoot has always treated us fairly and their pricing is reasonable. I recommend Cahoot to other Sellers without reservation.Date of experience: December 31, 2023AdvertisementDEDan Erdman1 reviewCAFeb 1, 2024RedirectedCahoot Has Stolen Our Inventory - Stay FAR AwayIn my 7 years of business, the \"partnership\" with Cahoot has been the worst business mistake of my career. Stay far away!They constantly made errors with shipping, i.e a simple 60 piece wholesale order took 2 months to ship when they promised 2-3 days, they also promised they'd be able to use customer supplied labels but then redacted it and we had customers constantly emailing us the wrong products were shipped or missing items. Finally the worst part is now we want to break away from this scam, move our 6k pcs of inventory, (less than 100 boxes), they're requiring we pay $22,000 USD. It's a 5 hour job to move inventory yet they are pigheaded we must pay that amount to release our property. They misguided fees in intro calls, saying removal fees are billed as a wholesale order, ($45 an hour) - however they have a hidden fee which they claim entitles them to a $2.99 removal cost + additional BS fees ontop of it.Date of experience: February 01, 2024Lea Tacugue1 reviewPHMay 22, 2023Under promised and OverdeliveredHighly responsive team that genuinely cares about your success, from onboarding to support to billing and account management.Handsfree – Cahoot takes care of everything so you can focus on your business.

They provide strong client support and help you get things done as easily as possible.  They are reliable and will make sure you are set-up and integrated as needed with other platforms and services such as Amazon Fulfilled by Merchant.Date of experience: July 13, 2023Brock Richards1 reviewUSAug 22, 2024In Depth Analysis / Experience with Cahoot.aiPros:-Speed of Implementation-Valid tracking Rate-Network Proximity to Customers-Label Automation-Commitment to Internal ImprovementsCons:-No control over SFP Program Metrics, despite appearances and the pitching of many benefits of SFP.  It is up to the carriers to meet OTD.  Out of 1000 orders and $100k in inventory, we could not get into the program.-Reluctant Initial Consulting (after onboarding)-Negative Weekly Cashflow if receivables >1 week-Exclusive Use of Cahoot's shipping rates - locked in-Handling and Box Fees exceed your cost-No Cost Savings - Service costs go back into your COGS-High Margins Required to make it work-Significant Cash Reserves Needed-Increased Time and Effort, esp. if SFP-Immature Software, though decent automation-Untimely Communication for service disruptions, such as service suspension due to billing disputes risks channel health. For example Amazon orders may not ship during disputes, risking account level suspension for late dispatch.-Non-Refundable EFTs - a problem if a charge is disputedThis company poses a significant risk for small and low-margin businesses, especially in exchange for contracted services with terms.  The lack of control over SFP metrics, coupled with substantial upfront costs (deposits), handling fees, and negative cashflow can negate perceive benefits and strain financial resources.   The potential for service disruption without recourse for mission-critical business operations is something that needs to be vetted up front.  The potential for miscommunication and immature software further exacerbates these issues making Cahoot.ai a high risk option for businesses without strong cash reserves and/or high margins.  Careful consideration and a thorough, deliberate review of these risks are essential before making a commitment to their services.  This is a real customer experience.Date of experience: April 30, 2024Timpanogos Hiking Co.1 reviewUSSep 14, 2023Great company to work withCahoot has been very responsive and helped us begin to scale in the first year of our business.

We have been happy to see considerable savings on SPD costs instantly. What I was not expecting was the excellent level of service from the Cahoot team. They took care to analyze our business in detail before we onboarded so they were certain they could fulfill their promise of service and cost. The onboarding process was extremely easy. The Cahoot team did all the heavy lifting and the Cahoot platform is simple and easy to use. Working with Cahoot provides us with the flexibility to store product near our customers. The team continue to work with us to ensure we distribute our inventory to the right locations across the US to reduce our SPD label costs. Rather than buying an app or a service, it feels like we have begun a great partnership with the Cahoot team who have a genuine interest in helping our business to succeed.Date of experience: February 12, 2023Shaul Edelman1 reviewUSOct 26, 2023Cahoot is an innovative peer-to-peer fulfillment platform!Cahoot is a great company with a team of real innovators and a fantastic software. My review will be focused more on the software:The Cahoot software is very well thought out, with many unique features that set them apart from the competition. What was really a game changer for us is the fact that the software does rate shopping automatically and when we came in each morning to the office the labels were ready to be printed, saving us a tremendous amount of time and giving us the peace of mind that we are paying the lowest rates for our shipping. This enabled us to keep up with spikes in demand, such as when COVID-19 hit and Amazon FBA was backlogged for 2 months.I also love their built-in WMS tools, such as \"Scan to verify\" which essentially guarantees we are shipping the correct item every time!Finally, Cahoot has a customer support that really listens to the feedback of their users, and is constantly looking to improve their product. We started with them when the software was still pretty new, and they implemented many changes based on our feedback. This is not something to take for granted!Date of experience: October 25, 2023AdvertisementFMFenix Master1 reviewUSSep 24, 2023Clearly striving to be a great 3PLWe started using Cahoot about three months ago and they have been great to work with -- always trying to provide great service and address any concerns and issues quickly and effectively. We've been very impressed with their shipping performance and communication on status of delivery for packages. It's very helpful to know when a package has run into a delivery problem so that we can be proactive with the situation instead of reactive after a customer contacts us. They also set up a HAZMAT shipping solution to ship our products that contain lithium ion batteries which was previously a challenge for another large 3PL company we were using. They do a good job with this and we've had almost no problems so far.Date of experience: September 24, 2023MMMichael Miess1 reviewDEFeb 23, 2022Professional and quick companyThe Cahoot staff is friendly and well organized, cared for me and answered patiently my nosy questions.

The operation is absolutely professional and principled. The pricing is easy to understand. As a small business, I like that I can warehouse my product across the country. This geographic diversification optimizes shipping costs and lowers disruption risk from extreme weather events. Cahoot has been a rock-solid partner so far and I look forward to working with them further.Date of experience: May 11, 2022Jennifer Briggs1 reviewUSApr 30, 2024Cahoot saves us time and employeesCahoot has been an amazing addition to our business. We needed a partner that allowed us to ship faster, have shipping labels created automatically, and control our shipping costs. We could find other products that did one or two items well, but they never did the entire package and at the same time continue to be affordable. With Cahoot we are able pick, pack and ship so much faster. Before, we were routinely rushing until 6pm to get orders out, but now, we're done most days by 4pm and that leaves us a 1-hour break to clean up and ensure everything is completed successfully. Our shipping supervisors are actually able to supervise the entire process rather than just the shipping label process, which will make our entire team more efficient. As a result, we've changed our team's hours and they get out of work earlier and we are getting more done than just taking care of orders (cleaning, maintenance, etc.). The best part - we've been able to reduce our numbers by 2 employees. The ability to make sure that team members know what boxes to use is also invaluable. We are able to maintain inventory of boxes which means we know when to order more and can better budget for this cost. It also means that all team members are using the same box for items and it's the most cost effective box.Additionally, the Cahoot team is amazing to work with. They are organized and have the training expertly set up. They are responsive and always helpful. I look forward to seeing what they come up with next because I know it will be great. I also appreciate their knowledge in the industry and their understanding and leadership on what it takes to meet all the ecommerce and marketplace requirements.Cahoot will not dissapoint you!Date of experience: April 30, 2024Brandon Dettmers1 reviewUSAug 5, 2023Fulfillment PartnerAs a Cahoot fulfillment partner, our business is able to add revenue using existing resources.

The technology is easy to use and I feel confident in the quality control methods implemented to make sure orders are accurately fulfilled. By requiring operators to scan and verify each item as they're packed, the error rate is essentially zero. If any issue does arise, it's always a quick and easy support ticket away from resolution. Usually they respond within minutes and there's no delay in shipment. As a fulfillment partner we are also required to conduct bi-weekly cycle counts which helps to keep all parties on the same page. To this date, we've never been unable to fulfill an order due to missing inventory. Operating as a fulfillment company is not easy. It takes a ton of organization and flexibility but the Cahoot system really takes on a lot of the work. I'm hopeful that Cahoot will continue to innovate and update their technology. I love that they actively reach out and talk with us about our needs and what features we'd like to see implemented. I can see that they're invested in our success and I appreciate their commitment to a long term and positive relationship.Date of experience: February 21, 2022SSSFP Solution Seeker1 reviewUSJul 8, 2021We had a horrible experience with…We had a horrible experience with Cahoot.Beware when doing business with Cahoot.  We had a very unpleasant experience and question their honesty and integrity.  After we signed on with them and after they took our money for a year upfront and after shipped our inventory into their warehouse, they presented us with a new lop-sided Agreement that no sane person could sign (I apologize to anyone who signed this agreement because you felt you had no choice).  We had to take back our inventory and lost over $10000 with this company. They refuse to refund for prepaid service and damage caused by their warehouse.   (1) I believe that no honest company would present a new agreement and service levels that are undisclosed till after they take your money and hold your inventory hostage.  (2) They accept no responsibility for any intentional or non intentional errors or damage to your inventory while demanding their fulfilment partners accept full responsibility for the same for any errors or mistakes and (3) they are falsifying positive reviews as @Corey Tournet reported in his review.

This platform is nothing short of a game-changer for anyone looking for order fulfilment capacity without the expenses of warehousing, staff or all the other costs associated with filling your own online orders.  Cahoot relies on a network of hundreds of warehouses all over the country and can direct your orders to the warehouse that is closest to your buyer, reducing transit time and shipping label costs.From the moment I started using Cahoot.ai, I was impressed by its intuitive interface and user-friendly design. It's evident that the developers put a lot of thought into creating an environment that fosters seamless communication, efficient teamwork as well as easy and lowest-cost order fulfilment.  The real-time visibility Cahoot.ai provides for both CFP's and sellers is nothing short of amazing. Sellers can track shipments, monitor inventory levels, and identify potential bottlenecks in real-time, allowing you to proactively address issues and keep clients informed. This level of transparency can greatly enhance customer relationships and instill confidence in the ability to meet buyer needs consistently.The mechanisms in place for me, as a CFP, allow me and my staff to quickly fill hundreds of orders per day and the \"scan verify\" component ensures all of the orders ship with the correct product, quantity and packaging which reduces the sellers shipping costs and eliminates buyer complaints.  I am very happy to continue my work with Cahoot.ai and look forward to many more years in our working relationship.Date of experience: August 30, 2022AdvertisementHRHarold Rendon1 reviewCOMar 15, 2024We highly recommend CahootPartnering with Cahoot has been a breath of fresh air!

So you're billed twice. And to add pain to injury, they charge a 3% convenience fee for that unnecessary credit card billing. They say the credit card is only a secondary payment method, but they still insist on routinely charging both at the same time. How ridiculous! I tried for the longest time to get some resolution with customer support, but they were adamant that they are doing the right thing by double-billing, and they absolutely would not credit back the convenience fee nor make changes to their billing procedure, although I painstakingly described the problem to them. For such abominable billing practices and lack of any effort at customer service, I give them one star.Date of experience: April 08, 2024muhammad qureshi1 reviewUSMay 29, 2024Gave me 4 hours to submit MORE supporting documents despite having all evidence of lost Package.

AVOIDAt peak times, Easypost like to make sweeping changes to their API. They're based in the USA and seem to deploy these changes just before they clock off for the day, meaning we wake up to errors and have to wait another 8 hours for them to surface.The support is terrible - they actually can't resolve an issue with creating Royal Mail manifests, and refuse to try. We almost had our RM account suspended because we could no longer supply paperwork, and had to quickly move to Shipstation (far better, and excellent support).Their support staff were unprofessional, slow, and generally useless.Date of experience: September 30, 2021TETestijus1 reviewLTMay 10, 2021Never fixing system/API issuesNever fixing the issues in their system.

Sent all pictures of damage and requested the repair amount which would amount to $1200. Then I was told my claim was denied due to insufficient packaging after an underwhelming investigation. Item was packaged perfectly as are all our parcels, and the customer recieved a damaged beaten box with damaged goods inside.

We were so thrilled to find shipping help for my small business at a reasonable price, but now we've spent hundreds, if not thousands of dollars trying to repair what Easypost has done. A combination of miscounting inventory, losing entire cases, transitioning warehouses without notice, damaging product with box cutters (and sending those products to customers), and not honoring first-in-first-out inventory rotation, this has by far been the worst business relationship I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing.

The system was fine in the early days. As our volumes grew significantly over the following years, our operation became more complex and subsequently, we required greater resilience and flexibility in our carrier allocation. We found Metapacks rules engine, which was virtually unchanged since 2010 to be clunky and awkward to use. Support was extremely slow, and responses often unhelpful. Adding a new carrier or service was a slow and drawn-out affair. Account management at Metapack, in my opinion, was very poor, and we were unable to improve our label rates despite huge volume growth. Ultimately, we decided to leave. We found another solution, which as well as being cheaper, had a much more fluid and intuitive rules system which has supported our business really well through the massive spike in demand due to COVID-19. 1 year after we left, Metapack drew around £5,100 from our direct debit. They issued no invoice for this. On querying it, an invoice was raised for an account minimum of £350/month dating back a little over a year. They had not invoiced us monthly like they did when we were with them, so we had no advice of these charges. We have raised this concern with Metapack, and we’ve not been able to resolve it. They said we never formally notified them we had left and they had technical issues preventing them invoicing monthly. For a year. I pointed out how unfair this was and they just don’t seem to care. As we have grown our e-commerce operation over the last 10 years I have dealt with dozens of solutions providers, and I have never experienced anything like the treatment we had from Metapack. I am so glad we left, and with how we have been treated after we left, I will never look back.

Every few years I get a cold sore above my lip.  I've had this issue since childhood. When I travel overseas, I usually buy a tube of Acyclovir Topical to keep on hand.  If I catch the start of the cold sore, I can usually prevent a full break out.  Because of COVID, my supply was well beyond it's expiration.  Instead of cream, I requested a prescription for Valacyclovir tablets.  I thought I give it a try instead of the cream.  I went through the online interview and provided my insurance information.  It took several days to approve the prescription, then another few days to be informed I had a co-pay, and another few days before they shipped the prescription.  In total, 11 days and I'm still waiting.  In the meantime, the cold sore came and went. Other online services have been far more responsive, often receiving a prescription within hours.Date of experience: May 06, 2022Reply from NarvarMay 1, 2023Hi! Thank you for your review. We're sorry this happened to you. Narvar isn't an actual provider of delivery services. We're a B2B technology solution used by retailers to provide branded order tracking. Narvar is not a carrier or logistics provider. If you experienced any issues related to your delivery, please reach out to the retailer you ordered your package from or the carrier who delivered it directly. Thank you!JPjpluttme1 reviewUSDec 22, 2021VerifiedNarvar tracking stinksNarvar tracking stinks.  Why companies use this company rather than simply providing a tracking number from the carrier is beyond me.  It's often much easier and more informative to track your packages the latter way.Date of experience: December 22, 2021WAwalter 3 reviewsUSUpdated Nov 18, 2020no delivery !Ordering from online companies is risky. I have placed three to four orders during the last week and none on the orders handled by Narvar arrived. All have been tagged as delivered but not to me, the one who ordered them. This has been an ongoing problem with Narvar since it raised its ugly head. If I was forewarned that Narvar was going to be used I would cancel the order immediately. I tried to find an answer to my dilemma - but nobody takes responsibility so I cannot retract my claim against seller, NARVAR, shipping company. So here it remains.Response from NAVAR:Thanks for reaching out to Narvar support. Narvar works with companies to provide a tracking page. Narvar does not have any order information and Narvar does not deliver the products. You will need to reach out to either the company you purchased from or you can reach out to the carrier who is delivering your package.

We're not a delivery service, but work with retailers and carriers to provide you with the most updated status on your packages in an easy-to-understand format. If your packages have gone missing or were mis-delivered, please contact the carrier so they can help you. If you suspect this is a communication issue across multiple different retailers and carriers (e.g. we're telling you it's been delivered though it's still in transit, and potentially the package has shown up later...or not), please provide a couple of the tracking URLs to us at support@narvar.com so we can look into it and see what's going on there. Thank you!LALASSE1 reviewDEAug 5, 2022Narvar truly sucksNarvar truly sucks.

JAJames3 reviewsUSUpdated Mar 10, 2022Narvar website not accessableI received an email from a supplier with \".narvar.com\" added as the email's sender and decided to check it out. Tried the site itself (narvar.com) and got to a web page that said, \"Forbidden\" and that there is nothing else on that web page was confirmed by viewing the web page source. Clicked your link for Narvar with the same result. These are the facts. I choose to leave any suppositions, theories, conclusions, etc to be derived by the reader.Added: There was a request for further information, but the information requested was not about the experience, but was for further personal information which I declined to supply as I do not wish to compromise my relationship with my supplier. As I said previously, it was a simple attempt to access further information directly from the Narvar website. I am not the person that contracted with them for services.

Which, in turn, gives a feeling of trust and transparency during the returns and refunds process.Date of experience: May 25, 2023AdvertisementBec D37 reviewsUSOct 17, 2022Absolute garbage companyAbsolute garbage company, since they started using X Delivery in the United States.

Narvar is a service used by a retailer you've purchased an item from to provide order tracking and communication with you about your package. Narvar is not a carrier or a shipper of goods. As we're never physically handling the package, the issue you're experiencing is with the carrier who is providing us with a consistently changing delivery date which you are seeing. We recommend you reach out to your retailer or carrier shipping the item for additional updates or to share this feedback.

I was told that I needed to have a maintenance agreement with them otherwise they couldn’t install it. The sales person was very pushy and adamant about this so I reluctantly agreed. I told them I would agree to it for a year only and I did not want it to auto renew. In July of this year I received an invoice for about £350 for a new contract. I rang them to say I didn’t want it and told them of my conversation with the sales person a year earlier. They said they had no record of that conversation and I therefore had to pay £103 cancellation fee. I disputed this with them and they stuck to the same reason as to why I had to make payment. I invited them to take me to county court to let a judge opine on the matter. This went back and forth for two months - me having to explain to various people what the background was without progress. Three days ago the sent an error code to our machine blocking it and preventing us from using it until we paid. In the end we had no option but to pay. They are the most awful organisation to deal with and bullied us into paying £103 which we should never have been charged.

However we do not get the same level of service when we try to call Pitney Bowes Support - a recorded message directs you to their website, which is difficult to navigate and find the answer you are looking for.

They rarely respond, and on the rare occasion they do, issues remain unresolved.We have had multiple claims, and I’m not just talking about delayed shipments. When products are damaged, even with clear evidence (pictures before and after, and even photos from the carrier’s hub showing shattered pieces on the floor), we have never once received a refund. It honestly seems impossible to win a claim with them or get any reimbursement, even if you are lucky enough to get a response.The last incident? A small, soft plastic hot water bottle was destroyed . Not only did our customer receive an unusable item, but we were also charged €199.33 because it was somehow weighed at 18.3 kg!

In terms of the actual product, SendCloud works really well and we haven't had any issues since installing it. It's really streamlined our dispatch process and given us the ability to spend time on other areas of the business.Date of experience: August 01, 2024SESebastiaan2 reviewsNLOct 23, 2024Terrible experienceTerrible experience. If a parcel gets lost, good luck finding it with sendcloud. Their customer support is non-existent. Their ticketing system is HORRIBLE. You need to fill in ten different identifiers about a parcel nobody will ever look for. Their ticket system is absolutely garbage, cannot even find my ticket anymore after filling it in twice. Responses after their 'investigation' take a FULL WEEK. In the meantime, our customer is just waiting for an update. Terrible, terrible.

All meetings were very easy to understand as all procedures, were straightforward and simple, dealing with Serdar and Ben, was in a very homely and friendly atmosphere, with even out-of-office hours queries dealt with, and continuous support that we have with Serdar moving on, with his promise to call upon him whenever we require.

I looked through different companies who could help me, but when I found SendCloud, I stopped looking. They had everything I needed and more. After signing up, I was assigned my account Manager who's name is Serdar. Serdar has been AMAZING. After finding out more about my new business, he has \"held my hand\" every step of the way, Firstly through regular Zoom calls to begin with, helping me set up my SendClound Account and then with telephone calls to check up on how things are going with me and always quick to reply to my emails.Based on my interaction with Serdar, I will highly recommend SendCloud to any business needing software to run properly, first time from order through to delivery including tracking.Date of experience: August 13, 2024Reply from SendcloudSep 6, 2024Thanks for your kind words Wesley, we're thrilled to see how much you enjoy using our platform and how useful it's for your business. We'll make sure to let Serdar know how happy you're with his help through the process, have a nice day!WVWard van den Berg2 reviewsBEUpdated Sep 10, 2024The art of driving away customersSendcloud succeeds in perpetually reaching new lows in support every day.They've elevated the closing of unsolved tickets to an new art, while costing their clients enormous amounts of time and effort in the proces.This must be the century's price-winning effort for discouraging and driving away clients that don't go for the payed bundles.On June 18th, several of our clients's Woocommerce webshops mysteriously lost their Sendcloud connection , and SC still hasn't succeeded in solving any of it. Instead, they revel in letting you repeatedly enter the same ticket, regurgitate all the necessary data... after which they close the ticket, never to be heard of again.Of course all the chat communication takes place along the well-rehearsed scripts of very polite and understanding lip service, so that's nice. A whole lot of nothing in a pretty bow!Finally, our last client has given the ghost and chose to move to MyParcel, so there you are. Mission achieved.Date of experience: September 10, 2024Reply from SendcloudSep 13, 2024Dear Ward,Thank you for taking the time to share your experience.

They are also listening to feedbacks and integrate them quite fast. I would easily recommend to anyone using Sendcloud services !Date of experience: July 15, 2022CUcustomer8 reviewsGBSep 9, 2024Another day, another SendCloud problemAn employee from SendCloud helped me with the automation for the weight-allocation on each order. This worked fine for around five months, before all hell let loose.Little did I know that sendcloud’s automation has had issues and was assigning all of my 2-15kg parcels as a ‘1kg’ parcel, which then would cost me around £2.50 of surcharges when they invoice me.I thought it was me at first, but having checked the system for five weeks now, it’s SendCloud themselves who are to blame. Contacted them via a phone call but the number they give you isn’t correct (it took them two months to rectify this, as per emails). This still isn’t fixed, but they’ve promised me it’ll be fixed by the end of the week.Saying I pay £2,500 a month for this service, I thought it would be better. Automations don’t work, SendCloud don’t contact the courier quick enough, and the phone number they give you is incorrect. What am I paying for?

Great to hear your feedback and of course we will pass this on to the team.Happy shipping!- RowieKLKlant2 reviewsNLOct 4, 2024We’ve been using Sendcloud with our…We’ve been using Sendcloud with our Magento store for several years, and it’s been a transformative experience for us. Instead of dealing with multiple integrations for each shipping company, Sendcloud brought them all together in one platform. This gives us the flexibility to quickly choose and compare shipping rates with ease.After reading some reviews, I felt the need to share my personal experience. Some store owners have mentioned issues with their shipments, customer support, and the ticketing system. While I can’t deny these problems exist, in my experience, they’re not as severe as some people claim.As a store owner, it’s crucial to add a margin to your product costs to cover the risks of lost or damaged parcels. This is something unavoidable whether you use Sendcloud or any other platform. Regarding insurance issues, Sendcloud acts only as an intermediary; they simply convey the information from the insurance company and do nothing beyond that.Another point worth mentioning is that long-time users of Sendcloud (3+ years) have noticed a drop in service quality recently. Previously, customer support was more efficient, and response times were quicker. However, from a technical standpoint, the platform continues to improve and become more user-friendly.The cost of using Sendcloud has steadily increased over time. Although the names of the fees may change, you’ll find yourself paying more. Additionally, we’ve observed that shipping rates we agreed upon at the start were disregarded after a few months, and we don’t believe we’re benefiting from the discounts initially promised.Sendcloud should take on more responsibility for parcels rather than merely acting as a middleman between store owners, shipping companies, and insurance firms. It’s reasonable to expect some compensation for losses, given the amount we pay to Sendcloud itself.In conclusion, using Sendcloud doesn’t reduce the risks your shipments face. The main reason to use it is the ease of use and convenience it offers for managing shipping.Date of experience: October 04, 2024Reply from SendcloudNov 1, 2024Hi,Thank you for your detailed review and for sharing your experience with Sendcloud. We’re happy to hear how our platform has streamlined shipping processes for your Magento store by bringing all carriers into one convenient platform. Your acknowledgment of the flexibility and ease of comparing shipping rates is truly appreciated.We also value your feedback on areas where we can improve. We recognize your concerns about recent shifts in customer support and ticket response times, and we are actively working to bring our service quality back in line with our highest standards. Your comments about the intermediary role Sendcloud plays with insurance are also noted; we understand the importance of feeling supported throughout the entire shipping process, especially when it comes to potential parcel issues.Your feedback is valuable for us as we continue to evolve and improve.

But...If you have any problem (and it happens quite often that an integration doesn't work), don't expect anything from the customer service. Such a low level of service is just crazy. Basically, it's always the same. You describe your problem, you get an answer saying that you need to delete the application, recreate it, and send them a video on how you did it. And when you do so, you get the same message again, indefinitely. Noone read your message, noone tries to help you.

We have recommended at least 4 other businesses so far due to the level of service received.Date of experience: March 27, 2024AMAdil Mohammad3 reviewsNLJul 10, 2023The easiest way to manage e-commerce logisticsWe are an e-commerce business selling shoes online, worldwide. Sendcloud’s integration with the web shop is seamless. The website itself is the easiest to use (you don’t need any training to navigate complex software) and most flexible in its offering (you can use multiple logistics providers and all their various different options). It really works really well for us. So well, actually, that in most cases, we use SendCloud rather than our preferred and contracted logistics provider’s own web site which is just not “digitally native” - meaning, more complex and “clunky” to use.Date of experience: July 10, 2023SPSamantha Picard1 reviewGBJun 26, 2024Keith made the onboarding experience so…Keith made the onboarding experience so easy and simple for me!

The issues occurred because of the complex nature of our ordering system, and not because of Sendcloud's feature set. Serdar and Ben went above and beyond to help ensure the integrity of the data we imported to Sendcloud, and they had us up and running in no time. This, coupled with the exceptional customer care, competitive shipping rates, and ease of platform use, make Sendcloud a brilliant choice for new Shopify customers, looking to streamline fulfilment or shipping. Date of experience: August 01, 2024Eutrema Ltd5 reviewsGBMay 30, 2024Sencloud arrangements resulted in 50 parcels being lost. No compensationThey arranged for us to drop parcels at EVRI depot. We followed their instructions to the letter. Over 50 parcels were LOST! Then Sendcloud refused to take any responsibility for the arrangement they made with EVRI. We provided a packing list and pictures of the shipment. Sendcloud wash all liability when things go wrong even though they are the ones that made the arrangements that resulted in 50 parcels being lost. The financial hit is taken by the small business, not the two global companies who messed up!They pretend they are just the facilitator, but they made the arrangements and took payment and profit. If you bought a rotten cabbage from the supermarket, would you expect a refund from the supermarket or the farmer???Date of experience: April 10, 2024Reply from SendcloudJun 6, 2024Thanks for sharing your feedback with us! As mentioned during our several phone, email and chat conversations we're truly sorry about the situation and can totally understand your frustration and the impact this has in a small business like yours.  In this case, we tried our best to mediate between both parties, as it's our role as mediators to try to gather all the necessary evidence to throw some light into the events and eventually find a solution. Like we explained during our exchange, the solution offered by our Sales department (bringing the packages directly to Evri’s depot) was outside of our guidelines, but always keeping your needs at heart and trying to find an alternative solution that would allow you to ship your packages as soon as possible. In any case, as it's outside of those procedures, this was a direct exchange between you and the carrier, outside of our platform, and therefore we don't have any visibility on what actually happened. It's unfortunate that you didn't ask for any receipt / Evri didn't proactively provide it when delivering your packages, as that would be the only way (apart from the CCTV recording) to prove that you actually brought these packages to their depot.  For that reason, we have asked for your cooperation in providing  us with the information requested by the carrier in order to continue with their investigation. We understand that it's frustrating to receive mixed information, as you were informed that Evri was already checking the recordings. However,  as you may understand the carrier has plenty of hours of recordings, so that's why they’ve requested that information to narrow their search. Unfortunately you’ve refused this request several times but if you change your mind we’ll be happy to share these details with the carrier and keep track of their investigation. We would also like to remind you that whenever you decide to ship with one of the carriers we offer in our platform, in this case Evri, you’re accepting their terms and conditions. Therefore, you’re subject to their decision when it comes to claim handling, as we cannot overrule their resolutions nor accept liability when the carrier decides against your request. We want to share once more our invitation to contact us again with the requested details in order to continue with the investigation, thanks again for taking the time to share your feedback with usNKNicolas Kidd1 reviewGBMay 23, 2024Please read before deciding Cannot say enough bad things about this company. There are so many better other options on the market that are currently available. If you're looking to scale and for flexibility, then look elsewhere. They couldn't be any better at overpromising and underdelivering. Constant technical issues. Completely incompetent customer service. Unwillingness to adapt for anything that doesn't fit within their narrow view of how a business should ship. Overpriced plans that reflect the business' shocking levels of arrogance.

The package got lost and the customer service from Sendcloud took weeks to investigate the issue. Asking me twice to fill out the exact same unprofessional Claim Form. They closed the ticket now stating that the carrier claims I received the package. This is not true. So just from a customer perspective - their customer service is horrible and it really seems like there is no insurance policy in place otherwise this issue would have been solved quickly.Date of experience: January 07, 2024GSGiles Small1 reviewGBAug 13, 2024Faultless Experience / Great ServiceReally smooth onboarding experience with online support and demonstration via online meetings until you understood the service.

That's normal.Unfortunately, most of our messages to Sendcloud's customer service have been ignored, by multiple agents, suggesting a bad company culture. By a stroke of luck, I was able to secure an onboard meeting, which was both rushed and impolite, not to say rude. Later messages have also been ignored.It is Sendcloud that crossed themselves off our list immediately, with their bad service.

This will cost us endless crazy amount of VAT which we have to pay.And in any court case where we need evidence that goods are delivered , after 1 year you are unable to show this. For business use a absolute NO GO and competitors like Packlink or Jumingo show the datas after years still. Sendcloud wake up, thats absolute no go for business use. Also your bills should show to which postcodes was shipped the goods. You should think that the users must have evidence in case of intra community shipments.

These costs are charged by the carrier after dispatch. We always do our best to be as transparent as possible about these costs. Therefore, we informed all our customers by e-mail. In addition, all information on this subject is available in our helpcenter. For this reason, we always point out that it is extremely important to carefully read the shipping conditions of the carrier you choose before shipping. Nevertheless, we feel very sorry that there is so much confusion about this. We have tried to contact you by phone so that we can discuss the issue with you again. Unfortunately, we were unable to reach you. Could you please leave your phone number in a comment on your existing ticket? We will then contact you as soon as possible! Thanks in advance. - SennaHEHenry3 reviewsGBNov 7, 2023Great companyGreat company, helps speed up our shipping process and has enabled our business to expand.

It's always nice to see your work appreciated when it comes to helping and advising our customers!DPDavide Piai1 reviewNLJul 29, 2024Unacceptable Customer Service and Refusal to Address ErrorsI am extremely disappointed with Sendcloud's service. I sent a parcel via PostNL using the Sendcloud platform. Sendcloud informed me that PostNL had issued a surcharge and that I needed to pay it. I paid the surcharge but also opened a ticket with Sendcloud.Sendcloud asked me to provide photos documenting the dimensions of the parcel, which I did. It became evident that the issue was a mismeasurement by PostNL.Despite having clear photographic evidence showing PostNL's mistake, Sendcloud refused to contest the surcharge with PostNL. In fact, I am not confident at all that they even contacted PostNL. Their unwillingness to address this issue or support their customers is unacceptable.Due to this error, I have lost over 200 EURO. The main issue here is Sendcloud's refusal to advocate on behalf of their customers when there is clear evidence of an error. I strongly advise others to be cautious when using Sendcloud, as their customer service is unhelpful and unsupportive.Date of experience: July 29, 2024Faisal Mushtaq2 reviewsGBJun 7, 2023The Worst company on the planetThe Worst company on the planet , do not go near them , absolutely useless software combined with world's worst customer support team , who have no Idea how to do a basic job related to their own software , wastes hours of our worktime . an absolute nightmareDate of experience: June 07, 2023Reply from SendcloudJun 7, 2023Hi Faisal, We're very sorry to hear that you are unhappy with our services.Our customer service team has been in contact with you and replied to all your requests.

The website on mobile never loads for me, had an instance where customers received their orders almost two weeks after placing it due to a 'relocation issue in the warehouse', took over a week for the solution to be resolved, took 3 customer success reps to come in to answer my questions, received angry emails from customers and a cancelled order where I lost money.

In 2023 they changed their pricing model towards bigger clients and we had to move but we had a good experience. Due to a miscommunication, we did not realize that the higher monthly fees were being charged on our account until 6 months after the fact, the customer support of Ship Hero was very understanding of our specific situation and refunded those fees at the moment of closing our account. I would recommend Ship Hero to any e-commerce business whose volume justifies the monthly tech fee.Date of experience: March 01, 2024SCStuart Cohen2 reviewsUSJun 26, 2024Extremely helpful staffWe accidentally sent a bunch of merchandise to a Shiphero warehouse (nevermind how: it happened).  Most warehouses are pretty opaque, especially if you are not a client.  I'm also used to the \"delay and discourage\" customer service of Amazon.  What a pleasant surprise I was in for with Shiphero!They responded immediately to my email, told they had found the packages and worked with me to immediately send them back to my warehouse in the USA (from Canada).  They were polite, upbeat and efficient.  They were real people with real names that were actually in close touch with the warehouse.  This is the kind of customer service I had forgotten existed.Date of experience: June 25, 2024MOMotti2 reviewsUSMay 28, 2024Fernanda is super helpful in resolving…Fernanda is super helpful in resolving carrier claims issues that arise from ShipHero issues.

They've utterly fallen apart this Q4. Orders from 2 weeks ago still haven't shipped. Customers are very angry.Complete radio silence on Shiphero's side. They won't take responsibility for anything or offer any timelines, information, or anything helpful. They've offered to prioritize certain orders but even those ones haven't shipped out.We are forced to shut down our advertising because we don't know if any goods will actually ship. Massive costs to our business because of their mismanagement and nonexistent communication.Edit: \"re-evaluate our client mix\"? Kinda sounds like blaming your customers because you massively under-hired for Q4, and still aren't fulfilling orders fast enough to catch up.Date of experience: December 06, 2022Reply from ShipHeroDec 8, 2022Hello there,We acknowledge that we have unfortunately fallen behind this Peak season and our teams are still working as hard as possible to get caught up. We will be taking steps to re-evaluate our client mix and make improvements into Q1 2023 and beyond to avoid issues like this in the future. We appreciate your input.JØJørgen1 reviewNONov 24, 2022Shiphero supportHave had some issues with different things in Shiphero, but the customer support reps are usually very helpful.

He offered to call me when we were having some syncing issues which has never happened in all the time we have put in support tickets. He also went above and beyond to help me upload a file that I was having issues with that was on a tight time restraint. We are still having some issues with the product upload not working consistently and some other small issues with tags and other info.

Customer service very poor.I tried to create a removal order for stock in the ShipHero US warehouse to ship to our UK warehouse over 5 weeks ago but it is still not ready for collection. It is apparently packed onto pallets but it has taken over 3 weeks to be provided a packing list (which we still don't have!)At this rate, it looks like the stock will not arrive in time for Black Friday in the UK which will cost us a fortune in lost sales. We have been given the run around by the customer service rep who has been unable to provide a simple packing list or reply to an email. I would strongly suggest avoiding ShipHero based on the customer experience we have had.Date of experience: August 18, 2022Reply from ShipHeroOct 21, 2022Hi Frazier,We appreciate your frustrations and we regret that you have had a bad experience with our team.

They were doing ok until 15 months ago, then they completely fell apart. Orders are not shipping out for months, support team ignoring you, software bugs and the highest fees in the markets - on increasing prices they have actually been consistently quick and efficient!

We have been unable to process some FBA orders since December! Please do not work with ShipHero. I have never seen a logistics partner so incompetent.

Ever since they changed to Zendesk the response time has become unacceptable.  It is routinely more than 8 hours for simple issues.  Shipments are now regularly leaving late or missed.  The staff is knowledgeable and effective - just can't get to them.  Probably an issue with scaling.  Very frustrating.Date of experience: September 07, 2022Reply from ShipHeroSep 20, 2022Hello JC,Thank you for sharing your insights with us and expressing your frustration. We appreciate your candor.

Please note once they move you to distributed inventory they need your kits to be turned into “build kits” or warehouse can’t ship if they don’t have full inventory. Probably something they should tell you about.Revising my review back to 5stars as this is what I would have given them apart from this month long mess up.I don’t know what’s happening at shiphero lately but I can’t get a resolution to a simple issue. They have a bunch of my orders marked as on “backorder” despite having inventory. A couple of customers are waiting over a month and despite contacting shiphero nearly every day for three weeks they haven’t been able to sort out whatever the issue is (or even tell me why)Horrendous and rediculousDate of experience: September 20, 2022Reply from ShipHeroUpdated Oct 21, 2022[Edited]John, Thank you for following up with an update on your situation and how it was resolved.

Thank you.Zaid Jamal1 reviewUSFeb 27, 20235 star review thanks to Emilio.The reason I am leaving a 5 star review is due to the incredible helpfulness of support agent Emilio who has been there with us to help resolve some of the most egregious fulfillment issues (some detailed below). His customer care is very prompt, friendly, and he works to resolve issues truly end-to-end. My overall experience with ShipHero has been varied. While they are good at fulfilling domestic orders in a timely manner, there were hiccups when it came to their international partner. There was also quality control for special items like handling artwork, gift packaging, etc. I wasn't told when a special project was needed to ensure those items would survive the packing stage without damage. And so I found out the hard way from customers, which is a bad look.Date of experience: February 17, 2023Reply from ShipHeroMar 2, 2023Hello there,We greatly appreciate your candid feedback and your praise for Emilio. Our team works everyday to do the best we can for our clients, and we are grateful for the feedback to help us identify shortcomings and improve.

Terrible communication. Endless delays at the Allentown, PA warehouse. Lack of transparency. I was told shipping to the UK would cost around $9 so I sent thousands of dollars of inventory. Only then was I told that there would be additional costs for VAT compliance, taxes, fees, fuel, etc. It ended up being around $20 to ship a pair of sunglasses! Working with their partner Passport made matters even worse. If you're shipping only in the US and get a better warehouse (like SLC) this might be a good option but if you're doing international, I would steer clear. You're better off shipping from China. I chose ShipHero to streamline operations. It turned out to be a two-month disaster that nearly sunk my business.Date of experience: September 21, 2022Reply from ShipHeroOct 21, 2022Hello Joseph,We regret any difficulty or miscommunication you have had.

ShipHero used to be amazing), but this 3PL now has the potential to kill your business. Orders are being shipped past SLA deadlines. They have lost multiple boxes of inventory (100s of units in each). They never arranged pickups with their international partner (Passport), so hundreds of international packages went missing. I am still waiting for my promised refund to be processed which was supposed to arrive in 5-7 business days. It has been weeks.

Sad story Ship HeroI totally agree with all the other frustrated business owners. One year ago this business was the one i would recommend without hesitation to all e-comm business owners, now it has fallen hard and they are way behind. They have likely expanded too quickly without proper infrastructure and their customers (us small biz owners) are suffering. Orders take more than 1-2 weeks to ship out and I have to manually fulfill all of them now and use my own stock. I'm just grateful i can do this because after emailing 3 times and getting the orders \"marked priority\" they still don't go out. Sad to see a once efficient business tumble and become extremely unreliable and disappointing to partner with.

Literally every ticket that I open it takes them days to resolve it, even if the tickets are so simple. I had an urgent ticket that I was talking to some girl and she said she will check something and be right back with an answer. It has already been 4 days... I have so many examples like this. They used to be good, not anymore. Even the prices increased and they use some weird shipping companies just to cut on costs.Date of experience: August 13, 2022Cuerbosch Trisquel1 reviewUSFeb 28, 2023Five Stars for Luis who really helped…Five Stars for Luis who really helped us with a sync issue.

Shippo made an outrageous \"address validation\" invoice for around 9000 orders at once (Nearly $1000 USD) with no breakdown of how these charges could have occurred. The fact we have only used shippo for a handful of orders this year. They keep attempting to charge the card daily, even though it has been reported to customer service and they acknowledge there is a widespread error. We will have to pursue the fraudulent charges through the bank like the other recent review. Very disappointing as we have used the service for around 6 years.Date of experience: November 05, 2024Naturcontact US1 reviewGBNov 3, 2024Hidden fees & lowkey scamAs a business we don't recommend working with Shippo. They attempt to charge a \"address validation fee\" even if any parcel will be sent and any shipping label will be used, they just give the final bill with enourmous amounts. Please be aware of this and be aware that this is not a business compliant procedure. We raised a chargeback with our bank and informed our lawyer, they will have to faces legal consequences now. We hope this review could warn many other businesses to stay away from shippo, unless you are actively using the platform and then address validation makes sense. Otherwise stay away and be ready to deal legally with them.Date of experience: November 03, 2024Natalie Bowman1 reviewUSOct 21, 2024Getting insurance is a joke on ShippoGetting insurance is a joke on Shippo. It is a 3rd party company called XCOVER, you pay for it on the shipment with Shippo. If something happens to your product in shipping you are basically not able to actually file a claim. A claim has to be filed within 10 days of it being delivered. This does not work if you ship with Amazon and the customer has 30 days to return the item. You need to get the product back from the customer to get photos to submit the claim within the 10 days of delivering it to the customer. So the customer is supposed to just get it and ship it back right away. This doesn't happen with Amazon customers. Therefore, all claims become invalid and you can not submit. The timeframe for a claim is a joke. Date of experience: October 21, 2024RHRyan Himel2 reviewsUSJun 11, 2024Ended up closing my accountEnded up closing my account. I had to pull teeth to get a refund I was owed - chat rep was slow and took over 30 minutes - and they actually held onto another refund for 2 years before I discovered it; never once in those two years did they even let me use it as a credit toward postage. Further support reps said sorry but condoned this behavior. Pirate Ship is a lot better since their site is more intuitive and their support is responsive.Date of experience: June 11, 2024Reply from ShippoJul 16, 2024Hi Ryan,Thanks for leaving us a review.

Having pricing all in one place if fantastic. Works so well for domestic and international shipping. All it is missing is a saved address book I can easily load for repeat mailings to regular clients. I had to make single csv's but would be nice to just type in Joe Smith and it loads from my saved contacts. Why I took off a star. Otherwise 5 stars saves me so much time and money going to one shipping destination.Date of experience: October 28, 2021JUJulie1 reviewUSOct 27, 2021InvitedAppreciate the ease of using shippoAppreciate the ease of using shippo.  Far easier than the USPS site with options for other ship options. If the country would automatically populate with saved addresses it would be nice, but not an issue that would keep us from using. Adding the postage printer on our end helps immensely.Date of experience: October 27, 2021Tea Sangha3 reviewsUSOct 26, 2023Good setup but watch it!I do like how easy it was to set this up and plug it into my Wix account. MY shipping costs are generally low do to low weight of shipped goods and domestic sourcing but even with that I did notice odd charges. You have to really pay attention to this which makes it inconvenient. I did get good customer support and refunds when i complained about things but it took time and sometiems felt like it wasn't worth the effort.Date of experience: October 01, 2023David Null4 reviewsUSMar 4, 2024New policy price gouges customersReceived an email from Shippo notifying me (and all their customers) that there would be a new 25% deductible on shipping insurance claims. So, If I insure something for $500 and pay for $500 coverage, and if my shipment was to get lost, I would only receive $375. What a ripoff. If I want $500 coverage, I shouldn't have to buy $666.66 worth of insurance to get $500 in actual coverage. Will never use them again. Date of experience: February 27, 2024Reply from ShippoMar 4, 2024Hi David,Thanks for leaving us a review. We’re really sorry to hear about your discontent with our new insurance terms. We understand that a 25% deductible for certain items may seem significant. This policy, however, helps us keep the program sustainable for all Shippo users so we can continue providing our merchants with the best shipping insurance that's comprehensive, easy, and affordable.For clarity, for domestic shipments, insurance for your package only costs 1.25% of your order's total value. For international shipments, insurance costs 1.5% of your order's total value. To put it into perspective, if your order is valued at $500, you would only pay $6.25 or $7.50 to insure your package. In the event that your package is lost, damaged, or stolen and you have an approved claim for the full value of your item, you would receive a reimbursement of $375, in addition to the value of your shipping label.If you have any questions around this, please feel free to reach out to support@shippo.com and we'd be more than happy to help.Thanks,Shippo SupportJJJC J1 reviewUSNov 3, 2021ID pics and face recognition REQUIREDcreated a few labels then they said I need to send pics of ID and face recognition too. Then all payment methods were blocked until I sent the ID and subjected to their face recog that doesn't work, BTW. So invoice is due, can't pay it, and they won't accept CC's until verify account. THIS IS THE WORST LABEL COMPANY EVER!!! It's a nightmare and you face possibly having your credit rating ruined. They are not a financial institution or a gov't entity. Why demand these personal details. They could be hacked tomorrow and all of it stolen. I so regret ever opening an account with these parasites.Date of experience: November 03, 2021ECEddie Covington2 reviewsUSAug 13, 2022A cheaper alternativeWe looked for a cheaper alternative to shipping a large but lightweight box.  Shippo was about half the price of the UPS website. Must admit, we were a little skeptical at first,  not fully understanding the shipping industry,  so we took a chance and are very happy with the outcome.  Package arrived on time and our granddaughter is thrilled.Date of experience: August 13, 2022AGAsh Grey1 reviewUSUpdated Jan 13, 2023Horrible and NOT SECUREI learned today that someone used my personal name and address to ship a domestic package that I did not authorize via Shippo. I received an invoice for charges from UPS directed from Shippo for a package I never sent and doesn't even appear on my Shippo account receipts. How does this happen? Not only is it a massive felony, but that package could have contained anything with my name on it. I'm so glad I caught this and UPS luckily removed the charges. Do not trust your personal information with this website and shipping provider. Delete your account immediately bc clearly your info is not safe.Date of experience: December 05, 2022BCBCB Collectors1 reviewUSOct 27, 2021InvitedEasy to use free shipping software!Easy to use free shipping software for all your shipping label needs.

First and foremost, we  would like to apologize about the issue you came across. Looking through our internal tools, it seems like you reached out to our Support team during our offline hours, which unfortunately explains why none of our representatives were able to chat with you. However, it looks like someone from our Support team was able to connect with you once working hours resumed and had resolved this issue by discussing how our estimated transit times work and by providing a refund.We would like to clarify that the transit time you see when you purchase a label on Shippo is the estimated transit time that's provided directly by the carrier itself. Shippo does not decide shipping times at all - it just displays what the carrier tells it to show. That means if you were to recreate the same shipment using the carrier's website and use the same exact details you entered in when you created the label through Shippo, you will be able to see that the carrier provides the same estimated days of delivery that is shown in Shippo. For future reference, if you ever have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to support@goshippo.com. If you prefer chatting with one of our Support members, please feel free to give us a call at your convenience at (415)-779-7447 and we'd be happy to help. We offer Phone Support M-F from 9-5PM PST.

FedEx overcharged us by nearly $500 for what should have been a $68 shipment. We opened a \"dispute\" with Shippo and after 20 days, Shippo could tell us no new information. They refused to send us the itemized invoice, would not let us talk to FedEx ourselves, and ignored requests for proof that they were actually in conversation with FedEx. Our bank advised us to open a dispute as we had zero information on the charge and were not getting any information. Immediately after opening the dispute, Shippo \"shadow blocked\" our account, ruined our operational shipping flow, and refuses to continue any conversation until the dispute is dropped. We're not going to pay for an illegal charge- I guess we'll have to switch over to Pirate Ship like so many other people here :-/. It's really a shame that Shippo wouldn't just communicate better to resolve this amicably with transparency.7/31 UPDATE: Shippo reactivated our account, but there is no movement on the dispute. I hope it can be resolved. The invoicing system is severely lacking in shipment details. Sometimes there's just a single line charge with no explanation that doesn't match shipments.Date of experience: July 14, 2024KSKenneth Steele4 reviewsUSMar 6, 2024I've been a customer for about 1 1/2…I've been a customer for about 1 1/2 years give or take and this BS of being locked out for security issues with NO NOTIFICATION OF A LOCKOUT, NO PHONE NUMBER TO CALL, & NO LIVE CHAT AVAILABLE.

Any time you call them a pre-recorded message comes on that they are not available. This happens every single time regardless of day or time. They ask you to leave a message. I think this is a one person operation, if not it will eventually be as they are useless. The login prompt on the website prompt you for a verification code that supposed to get sent to your email, guess what it never sends it, and if it ever makes it hours or days later the code is expired so you are stuck in a circle jerk of unable to login to your account.

It is free, its easy to use, and is great however there is one small feature that I feel needs to be included. I mail to teh same customers repeatedly and it would be nice to have a customer address book where you could save your customers in order to autofill the customers information and address for your labels. This way you wouldn't have to add their address manually every single or via a CSV. The reason being is that I only have a few shipments daily and taking teh time to create a CSV would simply be time wasted. A customer address book is truly needed and I for one would not have an issue paying a small payment monthly for this option to be included.Date of experience: January 27, 2022DIDinsa1 reviewUSOct 21, 2021InvitedSuperbly useful shipping resourceSuperbly useful shipping resource.

When UPS sends an invoice, the charges are egregiously higher than what Shippo quoted. Example, a UPS shipment Shippo said would cost around $9 was billed by UPS at over $40. I ignored the first several invoices from UPS because I had no idea Shippo wasn’t charging me for them and assumed it was a scam. Just got a collections notice from UPS for over $100 when I’ve never bought more than $30 total in UPS shipments via Shippo.

You can only send an email, and if you're lucky they will reply the next day. I've sent out 3 different emails in one day and only had one answered. Currently, we have an issue where the automations are not working, and their customer service team admitted it was an issue on their end but basically told me to deal with it. During Black Friday sales. Do yourself a favor and don't trust your business with this company.Date of experience: November 22, 2021HPHillel Posner11 reviewsUSMay 22, 2023Great when it works, but when it doesn't!!!! READI have had reasonably good experiences using Shippo with Etsy. However, recently a package was damaged, I paid $22 extra for insurance, and shippo is making it so difficult to file the claim, it almost isn't worth it. They need \"proof\" it's not repairable or 2 repair estimates. I've spent one whole day trying to get repair quotes and nobody will do it unless I pay $280 for the quote. Shippo is basically saying that's my problem. If I can't get repair estimates they won't honor the claim. Since nobody repairs this type of thing, the insurance was a waste. I will never use shippo again. The small savings is lost when you factor in both the time and the $$ spent on insurance and lost or damage goodsDate of experience: May 04, 2023DBDr. Bacon Has The Cure1 reviewUSOct 28, 2021InvitedShippo is easy to use and they…Shippo is easy to use and they integrate with Shopify to offer better rates on priority mail (USPS).

Marketplace, if you use their shipping is costly, eBay is about the same as Shippo, BUT Shippo keeps track of all my shipping, easy to transfer tracking.

Extremely slow to respond at all.  I bought a label based on accurate weight and took the package to USPS who verified my weight and provided a receipt to confirm it.  Weeks later shippo charged me an exorbitant amount stating my package was 2 times the weight I gave which my local USPS verified.  I provided them this proof.  Over 2 months later they stated that I still owed for overage weight fee.  You save so little with them and any saving is eaten up by fraudulent fees.Date of experience: July 27, 2023MAMatt4 reviewsUSUpdated Jan 11, 2023Use USPS dont bother with Shippo.Why doesn't Shippo just mail stuff using USPS rather than its own services.  The USPS is MUCH FASTER than Shippo and beats there service any day!  A package coming from about 600 miles from my house was sent via Shippo from a eBay's shipper, it finally reached my state after 4 days then its been like going on days 8 and it still hasn't been handed off to the USPS for final delivery!

Yes, I weigh and measure my packages, so I know for sure they're lying to get more money.There's no way to dispute them and you'll never see that money again. You're better off paying full price for a label and not getting hit with surprise surcharges.This and every other third-party label seller are total scams. They will kill your profits with these hidden surcharge fees.

I would advise no one to use Shippo for their business parcels - there are more professional companies at one's disposal, or just ship from USPS. I have a professional postal scale. I always round off to the next highest pound. 99% of the time my parcels are considerably less in weight -  by more than 6 ounces in weight. Consistently Shippo has charged my account an overcharge for weight - which is impossible. On a couple of occasions I was charged for an oversized box which is also unjustified. Box sizes are exact, size printed on the box, and I don't over stuff. I have a medical supply business, units are well insulated for transportation, I don't stuff my boxes. Today I received a $5.21 surcharge for a shipment made on February 14th! Over a month ago! I've shipped many orders since that date. Dishonest company.

My interaction with support simply resulted in palming me off to FedEx support which has then lead to me looking deeper into how this 'service' works. I've had problems getting prices from Fedex due to a \"NOTE: The destination state/province code has been changed.\" (x2) but looking deeper, only Hermes is supported in the UK and therefore this entire product is pointless and support could have said that it is due to this... but nope. Or is it? \"Shippo supports FedEx, DHL Express, and UPS, as long as those services exist within that country and your account is enabled for domestic shipping\" Either way support had no intention of spending any time looking into this. Surely they should know what causes there own system to throw the above error, as they are the ones that created the verbose for the error and therefore the conditions of display.... Either way Shippo doesn't seem to care.Date of experience: February 11, 2022LSLady Sweet Cakes2 reviewsUSOct 20, 2021InvitedShippo is easy to use and helps keep…Shippo is easy to use and helps keep all my orders organized.

We apologize that you ran into trouble with surcharges from UPS. Looking over your correspondence with one of our Support members, it does appear that our team relayed what caused these UPS surcharges and what we're doing to help resolve this. To re-clarify, it appears that UPS applied Zone Adjustment surcharges to your shipments, meaning that your packages were dropped off at different UPS locations from what you specified when purchasing the labels. The transportation charges will not be accurate if the pickup address on the label and the actual pick up address are not the same, and thus, UPS will charge a surcharge since the prices of the label change due to the distance the package is traveling.As UPS states, “On the shipping label, we had VA 22101 and this package was dropped off in WA 98052 so we had to pick it up from there.\" This happened on a couple occasions, in which another package of yours had a sender address listed as a Connecticut address, but it was mailed from Texas instead.We understand that receiving surcharges after shipping is always a surprise, and we’re very sorry this happened on multiple occasions. When this happens, we will do everything in our power to fight these charges with UPS (or any other carrier). Our Support team member had reached out to UPS on November 8, 2022 to dispute the charges and is still waiting to hear back from UPS. As a side note, these disputes are successful at times and at other times, the carrier will deny the dispute if their findings are accurate.  We hope this helps clarify things. Our Support team will update you as soon as they hear back from UPS. If there's anything else we can help you out with in the meantime, please feel free to reach out to us at support@goshippo.com. If you prefer chatting with one of our Support members, please feel free to give us a call at your convenience at (415)-779-7447 and we'd be happy to help.

I shall try and see whether it works.Update: the Shippo team has gotten back to me about this. They've been helpful to facilitate a workaround.

We regret any misunderstanding our recent email has caused you.

To express our appreciation for our customers for their time and effort, we decided to give something unique to the first 50 customers who responded this year. We’ve discovered that some of our email subscribers received this email a day late, which has caused some confusion. However, we promise you that the first 50 respondents to our poll received gift cards. Furthermore, our customer’s personal information is vital to us, and we take great pride in maintaining their privacy.

We had two automatic insurances applied to every order.

One order alone cost us a couple thousand dollars in damages. We thought we were fine because every shipment had automatic insurance applied, nope. They told us we would be getting a refund, then they took it back and said no. Been back and forth with them for 2 months over this.

Been trying to reach them for weeks now for help (I was forced to email the sales teams) with no luck.I will be exploring alternatives for all my e-commerce businesses.Date of experience: October 06, 2022Reply from ShipStationOct 9, 2022Hi Daniel,Thanks for flagging this, and I'm sorry you've been having issues recently. I've received the email you sent, so will reply to that.

Unfortunately their system wasn't able to connect to our website, which was a bit of a shame as we had high expectations. Told we could have a trial period if a payment was made, it would then be credited back. Left them a message for a call to discuss but no reply as yet. No refund of our payment either which is pretty poor. At this stage, you might want to avoid if possible.Date of experience: October 22, 2021Reply from ShipStationOct 22, 2021Hi Todd,Thanks for taking the time to leave your feedback. I'm sorry it's not been a great experience for you.It looks like the team agreed credit for an extra 30 days on top of the initial 30 days free trial, but clearly something wrong. I'll get the team to look into it.If you'd like to discuss this further, please don't hesitate to contact me on reviews@shipstation.com.Many thanks,JonathanShipStationAdvertisementMUMuneeb2 reviewsUSNov 29, 2023Dont expect a refund if you decide to quit usingAfter opening online stores we thought we would give shipstation a shot to see if it would benefit the business. We transferred money over to pay for shippings costs. A week later we decided to quit because shipstation was hurting our VDR rate. Was told money would be refunded in 30 days, almost 90 days later and still nothing. Have reached out multiple times only to be told to wait 30 more days. That is slimy.Date of experience: September 15, 2023LWLW3 reviewsUSApr 8, 2023Truly terrible companyTruly terrible company. I have a scale that reads the same at UPS, I’ve done comparisons. And I put all my info into creating a label, ship the same size boxes every time, and regularly get these “automatic funding” charges saying my packages from 6-10 months ago needed a more expensive label. I would NEVER have used the label if they told me the correct price to begin with….shouldn’t they pay for not confirming the right label costs? Of course they won’t. They barely tell you why they’re randomly taking $80 from your account suddenly. They’re shady. You also have to pay for an unnecessary subscription to even talk to customer service.Date of experience: April 08, 2023SLSarah lee1 reviewUSUpdated Jan 27, 2022Derek Necak is amazing!Derek Necak provided by far some of the best customer service I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with.

We were happy to implement the service and has since sped up our working practises considerably. We had queries getting started and these were quickly addressed by either setting up a quick meeting with Mustapha the same day using their super quick booking system for zoom calls, or the online support team who were also very knowledgeable.In short we would recommend this service to anyone.Date of experience: May 18, 2021Reply from ShipStationMay 19, 2021Hi Sam,That is amazing feedback.

For over 2 months, the case is still open. Then, waited for more than half an hour (41 in queue) finally had to chance to chat. I was told ShipStation does offer cubic pricing. When I show him/her a 0.1 cubic foot package, 6 zone shipping, the rate is $12.03! I said this is incorrect based on Stamps.com or USPS officially published rate, I was told ShipStation has different negotiated rate! That is funniest I've ever heard: excuse me, negotaited higher rates? I showed $9.18 from Shippo, which is exactly same as that from Stamps.com's cubic pricing rate chart! $9.18 vs $12.03, no reason to use ShipStation!Date of experience: June 30, 2022Reply from ShipStationJun 30, 2022Hi Shawn,Thanks for taking the time to leave your review.

To say these people are thieves would be an understatement. Insured a package I sold on Ebay and the ebay link to the sale of the actual item is not enough proof of value.

My daughters house appears difficult to find for some couriers, so I’ve told her to use What3Word to the front door and it hasn’t let her down. My specific reason for writing this review, was to find an exact W3W location for a satellite image, that didn’t have any identifying locations close by. W3W responded with ///smile.extending.routs, which lies at the coordinates (40.935290,38.455769).

Both apple and Android phones have a builtin system to make it exremely easy to send you lat/long to emergency services. Users should be encouraged to set up this system.In addition, all messageing apps on both Apple and Android make is VERY easy to send your current location (lat/long coordinates) to anyone.

Tried finding a hospital entrance in an area of the country you haven't visited before? - the best you get from searches is usually the area's post code. And, finally, there is the meeting up at a point with no address - on a coastal path, or part way up a mountain.

I spend most of my life either on my farm or others and simple tasks like drain locations, pipes and other services are really easy to map, save and share with others. I’ve needed a field drain clearing and it take seconds to send a really accurate location to someone instead of the old way of telling them to take 20 steps south and 5 step east from a tree that you forgot blew down 2 years earlier. I also hire storage tanks and it’s really useful to plot exactly where they are if you need to send someone else in to collect them, and when a customer sends you the location for delivery.

Introvabili e-mail di qualsiasi genere. Esiste una chat incompetente che ti rimanda a qualche agente che non richiama. Altrimenti ti devi infilare nel coacervo delle varie FAQ con risposte precostituite che non contemplano mai i reclami. Come fosse tutto rose e fiori e l'azienda immacolata. Questa è un'azienda arrogante, ha un atteggiamento dispotico che forse si può permettere solo in Italia. Non credo che in altri Paesi europei e mondiali e nemmeno in Spagna da dove proviene, gli sia permesso di esercitare questa arrogante posizione dominante in tutta tranquillità. In conclusione: per sporgere un reclamo devi scrivere una raccomandata all Sede spagnola (spendendo 10 euro), i quali non ti rispondono dopo 1 mese. Pertanto Auctane si arroga il diritto di sbagliare e mandarti una fattura fasulla, per la quale non hai usufruito di un servizio, e poi non mette a disposizione degli utenti i mezzi per richiedere un rimborso.

If you're willing to navigate the landscape of data collection and enjoy being compensated for sharing your purchasing habits, Fetch offers a sweet deal that's hard to resist.Now, let's address the elephant in the room—the data collection. Fetch is straightforward about its approach, collecting and likely selling data about your purchasing habits. While this may raise concerns for some, the compensation offered in varying amounts, leading to gift cards or sweepstakes entries for attractive prizes, is a fair trade-off for those comfortable with this arrangement.While the website aspect of Fetch might not be the main focus, as the platform is primarily app-based, the app itself is a standout feature. Using Fetch feels like turning receipt scanning into a game where winning points is the only option. The interface is user-friendly, making the process enjoyable and effortless. It's a refreshing take on turning a mundane task into something engaging.I highly recommend Fetch to avid shoppers, especially those who frequently succumb to promotional offers. The app is notorious for incentivizing purchases of certain brands and products, accelerating your journey toward gift card redemption goals. For shoppers who don't mind the data exchange and love a good deal, Fetch is a win-win.Date of experience: November 24, 2023Previous1Next pageCompany activitySee allClaimed profileAbout Fetch TechnologiesInformation provided by various external sourcesFetch Technologies connects business to real-time data by automating access to  hard-to-reach internet information.ContactUnited StatesPeople who looked at this company also looked atTiqets47,792ClaimedFront Porch Agility5ClaimedWoof Pet Inc46ClaimedSuggested companies are based on people’s browsing tendencies.The Trustpilot ExperienceWe're open to allAnyone can write a Trustpilot review.

Hub Box said parcel was at the newsagent, newsagent said it wasn't. Customer service email replies were not swift, a lot of hot air and insincere placating. After a month of having my compensation requests passively ignored they just decided to wash their hands of it, passed me back to the sender and stopped replying to my emails.Absolutely did not get the sense that Hub Box cared about my experience or my property or about rectifying the situation at all and I never felt that they were trustworthy throughout the whole process.

After receiving parcel force tracking saying that my parcel had been delivered to hubbox  store, i awaited my code that did not arrive.  I called the store and enquired and the lady simply said \"I do not deal with the parcels\" and slammed the phone down, tried multiple times to call, with the same result.I emailed hub box on Monday and still they have not even bothered to contact me directly.

It is THE worst option to pick if you want to collect your parcel from another shop. This company said that they delivered my parcel, but apparently the shop has been closed for 5 months. God knows where they delivered my parcel, but from reading the rest of the reviews it looks like the company steals everyone’s packages and then just doesn’t give the collection code. To this day, I haven’t been able to get my parcel and I don’t think I ever will.

I went to the store to collect it and the storekeeper said he couldn't hand it over.  He said there had been some changes and the Hub Box number was no longer on the system. There was no way to enter confirmation of collection and he wouldn't be able to prove that I had collected it.  He told the courier that he couldn't accept the package but the courier said he had to do the delivery and wouldn't take it away. In the end the storekeeper agreed to hand over my package after I had sent an email to the retailer to confirm my receipt of the item but what a crazy situation.  This was the first and last time I use this service as I have zero confidence in it.

It’s Neth Associates, 76 Loughborough Road. The first time (Saturday) it looked open but the door was locked - I rang HubBox customer service who said they would contact the manager and phone me back - they never called back. There were three other people also waiting outside. Today (Monday) it was completely closed at 10.30am. This has wasted over an hour of my time and still don’t have my package. I’m not making a third trip - or using HubBox again.Date of experience: December 05, 2018Reply from Convenient Collect LimitedJun 14, 2024Hi Kate,This review does not correspond to a service which www.hub-box.com provides.

And generally just bad.The first time I went to pickup my order I didn’t receive my collection code until I emailed to get them to send one. Then, the collection shop had no idea what hubbox was and said they didn’t take it? Or use Royal Mail? So I lost £25 for the first order but decided to just accept it as I can’t be bothered to go through the challenging it. Hubbox didn’t reply anyway to my email only Royal Mail. So I re ordered the same things to a different collection point, to try one final time. Royal Mail has said the item was delivered 2 days ago. I yet again haven’t received the collection code from hubbox.

Like many I wish I'd come across this before thinking the 'Collect via your local HubBox' option was a good one.My experience has sadly been little different, no 'collection code' received and all the rest, even after chasing this up with their support team.In the end I went down to the shop where my parcel had been delivered in the hope that with the order details, tracking info from DPD, some form of ID etc, they'd still hand my parcel over...which they did, after simply asking what my surname was.This though was after an interesting 5 min conversation with the owner that began with \"Who are HubBox?\", followed by \"we've never used them\", \"we don't accept parcels from DPD\", \"why did you have it sent here?\", and that if I hadn't turned up within a day they'd have probably thrown it in the bin because they had no idea what to do with it.At this point I'm not sure if it's a case of extremely disorganised, or they're simply adding any and every convenience store they can find into their database in the hope they'll sign up, or they still get a commission no matter what.Date of experience: June 16, 2023Reply from Convenient Collect LimitedJun 13, 2024Thank you for your feedback, Brent!

I had gone to collect and the manager at the store had my parcel (that I have paid £70 for) in hand, but could not pass it 6 inches to my out-reached hand as I do not have a 'collection code'. This parcel was delivered 5days ago but no collection code issued to me. Typically, there is no customer service phone number - only a bot operated email address. I have requested my collection code but I suspect my email will fall into the ether. I have 2 more days to collect this parcel until its returned? Binned? No idea.

Will not use it again.People tend to use these services as it is a secure way to receive parcels when shopping online.  However, would not use this again.  I received an email to say that my parcel was ready to be picked up on a Friday morning but I had to wait till the following day to collect it, as need a person with me to help me (mobility issues etc).  Went to the place to collect it to be told the parcel is not here come back later.  I was livid, why send out emails to say a parcel is there and it is not.  It is not easy for people to pop back and forth.  I have email and telephoned Hub-Box but no response, apart from a generic reply to say they have received my email.Would never use this service again or the collection point of Woodfield Road, Leigh-on-Sea, Essex....absolute joke.Date of experience: November 02, 2019Reply from Convenient Collect LimitedNov 5, 2019Hi Becky,Thank you for taking the time to leave us feedback and we’re very sorry to hear that your experience using HubBox did not meet the standard of service we aim to provide.I can see that our Customer Service team actioned your initial email on Saturday afternoon and have been working on your request since.

Hub-Box have consistently failed to get hold of their customer email addresses to notify them of the parcel's delivery (we return them after 14 days), and to send them the necessary code to collect it. It seems customers rarely even know their parcels are 'Hub-Box' parcels (they're being tracked through Yodel/etc), and 50% of them never receive the Collection Code that is required for them to pick it up. It's frustrating for both the retailer and the customer, since we need that Collection Code to process the parcel correctly, even if we can verify their order, identity, etc, if we don't have the code, we aren't supposed to hand it over. When we first received a random Hub-Box parcel last year, I phoned my manager to confirm if we did it, and he didn't know either (or what it was). I assumed any issues like customers not receiving their Collection Codes would be resolved in the next few months, but it is still happening with the same frequency, and it is destroying the trust between the shop and our customers whenever it happens.Hub-Box's integration into the Collect+ (PayPoint) service seems like another unreliable and unnecessary cog in the wheel, further complicating parcel delivery at the recipient's expense.Date of experience: October 18, 2021Reply from Convenient Collect LimitedJun 14, 2024Hello Matsumoto, this review does not correspond to a service which www.hub-box.com provides, we specialize in providing checkout software for online retailers.

The first delivery arrived a day late.  The last delivery, yesterday, was shown as delivered.  No surprise it wasn't at the door and when I looked at the Intelcom proof of delivery photo it's at some other house at a totally different address.

There was no attempt to deliver. Their slip they left behind stated my name and a date, no other information. I run a business and thus have no idea which of the hundreds of tracking numbers I have this would relate to. I now have a missed delivery with no idea how to get my package nor whatever it is. Being able to search by name and leaving sufficient information to identify the package is the bare minimum of expected abilities of a shipping company. Oh note, I did not ever pick this company to deliver a package. I never will after this experience and will be mandating the companies I purchase from to ban them from shipping my products further after this experience.

Not only did the pkg. show up 2 weeks early ( which was great), but the driver was really good.  He didn't have my buzzer # for my bldg. so he called me directly from the lobby, rather than just leave my parcel where anyone could have taken it.  Then, when he reached my floor & started walking down the hallway towards my unit, he noticed I was standing in my doorway waiting for him.  He proceeded to \"run\" down the hallway, so as not to have me wait too long for him. He was also smiling & so pleasant (& it was a Saturday!).  So unnecessary to run, but GREAT customer service!

I ordered items on Amazon on the 18th and 19th, and they were marked as out for delivery. I contacted Intelcom to request a call from the driver upon delivery, but the driver did not come and falsely marked the package as attempted delivery. When I called back, the office was closed.The next day, I learned that my package would now be delivered on the 22nd. I reiterated my request for a call before delivery. At 1:30 PM, I was told the driver would arrive around 4:00 PM, as I was the 257th delivery. However, at 3:30 PM, I called again to confirm, only to find that the driver once again marked the delivery as attempted without showing up. Intelcom informed me that they would deliver it the following day.This entire experience has been incredibly frustrating. I ordered an item for next-day delivery, and I have no idea when it will actually arrive. I have requested that Amazon lower this company's priority in my delivery options. If I receive another package through Intelcom, I will reconsider my business with Amazon, and I encourage others to do the same to help eliminate this company's operations.Date of experience: October 22, 2024Read 1 more review about intelcom.caYvonne McCrindle2 reviewsCAOct 19, 2024By far the absolute worse delivery…By far the absolute worse delivery service I have ever experienced. They do not even attempt to deliver to suburban addresses, do not contact people who are expecting packages and are a total joke to try and converse with as all I have delt with is broken English and non caring attitudes, Amazon has taken a serious step back by using this excuse of a delivery service and does not give the customer the choice to use them or not. Totally unacceptable and I refuse to order if this is what they offer.Date of experience: October 18, 2024LALars1 reviewCASep 23, 2024Email Means NothingIntelecom sends an email saying your parcel will be delivered within 3 hrs. Lol,what a joke. Your lucky to get it the same day and quite often it is delivered to the wrong address. I wish Amazon would use another courier as this company offers very poor service.Date of experience: September 23, 2024LC Richards3 reviewsCAOct 1, 2024they give themselves a better rating than the customers do. Amazon needs to stop using them.I'm absolutely fed up with Amazon using this awful delivery company. Not only are my parcels consistently late, currently two days late, but apparently safe in their hands and on its way to my house, only took pended recalculation. The drivers keep throwing my packages over the fence instead of using the clearly marked delivery bin that's right under the address they take a photo of. My dogs have gotten into multiple packages, including chocolate I ordered, and countless parcels have been dragged into the horse manure field because of their carelessness. They send me a photo of my package sitting in the dirt driveway, right next to the fence they throw it over, along with a photo of my address—completely ignoring the delivery bin that's right there! Amazon needs to stop using this incompetent service. They now called themselves dragonfly, but under Amazon it says intelecom.

Parcels are usually dumped in places where they can easily be stolen, sometimes even by passersby on the street. Agents are lazy and disrespectful. On one occasion, an Intelcom agent physically assaulted our doorman for asking the agent to do his job properly. Every other courier and delivery service manages to do correct deliveries in our building. Usually not Intelcom. I know delivering parcels is not necessarily a great job, but if someone is going to take a job, they should actually do it or find something more to their liking. Intelcom is complicit in this dreadful \"service\" because they either do not train their employees properly, or they accept and even enable the terrible behavior. I always dread it when I see that  Intelcom is going to \"deliver\" a parcel to me. Date of experience: October 11, 2024Ken Simpson1 reviewCAAug 26, 2024Intelcom recently took over delivering…Intelcom recently took over delivering Amazon packages to my small community near Vancouver. They have failed to deliver almost every package, with a wide variety of hiccups. For instance, they delivered a bunch of things to my neighbour whose house has the same number - but on a different street. And today, they simply couldn’t find my house. I’m no longer buying from Amazon because Intelcom is so terrible.Date of experience: August 25, 2024Dunk TheCalamari BGCalamari1 reviewCAOct 26, 2024Great delivery personMy package arrived at the Surrey warehouse and was out for delivery the next day. Yesterday, the driver tried to reach me when he realized that my gate was locked. He was great—friendly and caring about my package. We even talked about the best place to leave my package in case he can't reach me next time. I had to post a positive experience. It depends on the driver if the experience is positive or negative.Date of experience: October 25, 2024JCJeremy Cobourne2 reviewsCAAug 27, 2024If I could give Intelcom negative stats…If I could give Intelcom negative stars I would. Every single prison gave me different information. My package was 4 days late because the driver would not read the delivery instructions or call me. They kept saying the address was wrong even though every other company can find the address of my business. I will not order anything if this is the company delivering the package.

Date of experience: October 03, 2024VFVivienne Farrell3 reviewsCASep 5, 2024Terribly slow serviceTerribly slow service, some orders take 5-14 days to arrive. No depot here so package goes back to sorting facility and 3 days later they try to deliver.I work am not always home during the day.I have waited home all day after checking that it’s out for delivery. They didn’t show and sent me an email at 8pm “we attempted delivery”. No you did not.No notifications about shipment progress.Very poor service, they can’t locate my 3 story apartment building and call for directions.There is a language barrier and drivers are hard to understand. I have asked Amazon 3 times to ship my orders by Canada post. They refuse, so i cancelled my Amazon account. It’s just too much hassle trying to get my orders. Canada post is much more efficient.Date of experience: September 04, 2024Read 1 more review about intelcom.caUPUpset16 reviewsCAOct 20, 2024Disgusting Courier Service  Received an email from Amazon asking how my delivery went yet Intelecom / Dragonfly but has NOT YET DELIVERED MY PARCEL! Tracking has not been updated since 6:15am and despite providing Intelcom with instructions to follow to CALL ME upon arrival these incompetent hard of English customer service agents can’t be bothered to tell me where their driver is in the City and expected delivery time. Absolute garbage customer service and useless courier company that does NOT follow delivery instructions given and fails to deliver parcels to correct apartment buildings. Date of experience: October 20, 2024DWDora Wilson6 reviewsCAUpdated Nov 5, 2024This is the third time Dragonfly has not delivered my Amazon Package.This is November 4th, 2014.  This is the third time Dragongly has sent messages via Amazon, claiming that they could not make the delivery and had attempted to do so, would try again. I was here so there should not have been a problem. I am beginning to think they are not delivering my Amazon package because I have posted negative reviews about their poor service. I was home. No one rang my buzzer. They did not follow instructions on Amazon, and chose not to deliver my parcel, to keep me waiting for two days. Bad, irresponsible delivery people. Twice I have dealt with Dragonfly which took over Intelcom. The first time they did not follow instructions posted on Amazon and were calling from outside the building. I had to go down to get the parel.This time I received a message that at 1:57 stating they would be here in the next 3 hours (5  p.m.). There was a message on Amazon claiming they ran into an issue trying to deliver parcel. Meanwhile there have been 2 Amazon deliveries to this Senior's Apartment building, which has only 2 floors.Well, I was here waiting, can you read or understand English?  Or what is your problem this time? No one rang my buzzer or attempted to deliver the parcel to my door.  If you are supposed to try again, when is that supposed to be?  Please read delivery instructions on Amazon, or have someone read them to delivery person. Date of experience: October 07, 2024Olivia Luff1 reviewCAAug 9, 2024Worst Delivery Service EVER0 stars!!! They continuously deliver to another address that's not mine (7 times and counting now) and claim they cannot fix the issue. The solution was for me to call and wait on hold every time I have a package scheduled for delivery to re-confirm my address, which I've been doing and they STILLLLL deliver to the wrong address, every. time. Over it and considering getting rid of my Prime account if Amazon doesn't can them asap.Date of experience: August 09, 2024FUFullmetal1 reviewCAJul 23, 2024Can't even deliver to someone standing right in front of themI swear this company couldn't deliver a package even if you were standing right in front of them. I live 30 minutes away their dispatch center in London, Ontario. Got the notification at 10am, saying my package would be delivered by 3pm. Changed to 5pm. Now it's after 10pm & the homepage just tells me.

Can't identify who sent the package I was notified about on the website. Endless scrolling on website leads to NO INFORMATION. Delivery instructions were NOT followed. Package left out in the open on doorstep so thieves could see it, not hidden as requested. Doorbell not rung. Am requesting that Amazon NEVER uses Intelecom for my deliveries in future.Date of experience: July 12, 2024FRFrancis1 reviewCAAug 7, 2024Awful delivery provider This is a terrible company that does not actually deliver shipments to customers. Just drops them any where for neighbors or strangers entering building to pickup and take parcels away. Drivers that do not care about customer shipments either. Drivers that don't use proper communication portals such as intercom let alone even recognizing the essential regard of using that communication portal. Waste! I do not recommend.

Intel was supposed to pick it up, they didn’t. Despite making arrangements with them twice they never showed. I ended up giving the item away. I was supposed to receive an item for my Granddaughters birthday today. Amazon shows it was picked up at 3:42 this morning, local time. So it’s here, in Calgary and Intel can’t deliver it for 3 days?

Date of experience: July 22, 2024CACaitlyn1 reviewCAAug 2, 2024Intelcom, no good.We used to have our amazon packages delivered by BNI. They were friendly and always on time!

Time for a change, amazon!!!Date of experience: July 31, 2024Mark1 reviewCAMay 22, 2024Terrible company Intelcom said there was a problem with the delivery , but provided no proof. The person I talked to said they would email the warehouse and myself, buy I never saw any more communication after that. The package ended up being sent back to Amazon,  which was frustrating because I needed it. Definitely makes me rethink ordering from Amazon if they continue to use intelcom.

He told the shipping company that I wasn't home, but the item never got back to them, which is normal process for intelcom. they get paid for \"attempting\" even though they never even try, and then I guess they keep the packages. Absolute worst shipping company.

The only minus is that Packaly when sending you an email doesn't specify from which company and neither does the form from which I bought mention Packaly as the shipper.

MAmevrouw Arif1 reviewNLSep 30, 2024Not a trustworthy company & staff It’s frustrating to deal with such an unreliable delivery service. Today (Sept 30), I received an email saying my package was delivered, but I haven't received anything. I contacted Zara and Packaly’s customer service. Zara’s representative, told me the system shows the package as delivered, but it’s possible they marked it as delivered even though it hasn’t been and I must wait 48 hours. That explanation doesn’t make sense to me, and this isn’t the first time I’ve had issues like this with packaly, unfortunately. My T & T number is: 069773777262It’s disappointing that Packaly doesn’t seem to care where they deliver packages as long as they mark them as delivered. It shows to me that PacakIy staff is very irresponsible and the company doesn’t care about their clients, therefore they treat them very badly! I find this extremely unprofessional, and because of repeated issues, I will no longer use Packaly for any future deliveries.Date of experience: September 30, 2024Reply from PackalyOct 1, 2024Hi! Thank you for your message and we sincerely apologize for the situation regarding your package delivery.

Zijlstra8 reviewsNLAug 14, 2024No next day delivery with these guysI'm in the Netherlands, ordered something from a Dutch company with shops all over the place and they apparently chose this, unknown to me, parcel service.Well, I'd rather I opted for delivery at one of the stores because Packaly postponed the delivery 3 days in a row. And then the delivery guy asked if he could put the parcel in the elevator instead of bringing it up to the 3rd floor. Not the best service!Date of experience: August 13, 2024Reply from PackalyAug 14, 2024Hi there! We have asked for more information regarding this so we can investigate what happened here!

I have been having issues with getting a package because the previous resident did not close their account. I called multiple times and everyone was extremely helpful but to no avail.

Not all delivery personnel even use it. They charge a non-refundable $20 activation fee & $3 for each day late the package is picked up. I forgot to pick a package up on time (1-day late) and had to enter my cc and be charged $23. If a package is too large & doesn’t fit, they leave it in our regular mail room. It does have a nice feature where one can schedule a vacation mode when on vacation & they will leave packages with the building. Since so many packages get left with the building anyway, FREE OF CHARGE, it’s absolutely pointless to use this service.Maybe if someone lives in a sketchy place where their packages get stolen, but even then, only a small percentage of delivery personnel even use it. Most leave packages in the mail room anyway. Going to cancel my account.

They keep charging you $3 daily, for packages that have been picked up. Almost every time I receive a package, I pick it up, and then for several days after i get charged $3 for supposedly not having it picked up. The crazy thing is that the code actually still opens an empty locker. I've made 3 videos showing the exact situation of a code opening an empty locker of a package that has already been picked up! At first you might think: \"Okay, this is propably just a technical issue\", but is it really?????This has been goin on for over a year, and they've charged me over $100 in $3 payments for packages that supposedly haven't been picked up! I work from home and literally always get my parcels the same day! This is just a trick they are performing on 1000s of residents in order to cash in!

When I went to the office to claim my package my property manager said that I had to call the parcel pending customer service for them to open the locker because the employee from Amazon failed to take a picture that it was delivered and could not send me a code to open the locker. So I called parcel pending and Mr. Aaron Long answered right away and was able to help with retrieving my package. He was courteous, his customer service was definitely amazing. He did not waste anytime. He asked all the right questions to make sure I was the customer and and also stood on the line to make sure everything went smoothly.

All three said to locker, but we got no text and/or emails. The apartment management and parcel pending login had 0 packages being delivered. We contacted via their email form, and no response yet. Well guess what?! Had apartment management use master key yesterday and all three packages were there! No codes sent and no communication to us. I cannot stand parcel pending and having to pay for a service if you can call it that, that I don't want.

I had issues with registering my account and changing my password. I informed Cheri that when I initially called support, I pressed a number to get help with registration and the automated voice told me that my account was registered and it disconnected. There was no option to speak to a representative. I was able to reach Cheri by choosing the prompt that offers help with packages. So, my account was registered but the system was not registering my username or password. Cheri was able to go in and help with that. She sent me a link via email and text for me to reset it and informed me that it's better to reset the password via email. Cheri also explained how I should use the pin that is associated with my account. I also shared with her issues regarding the mail at my apartment complex and she provided empathy and normalized my experience.

If lockers are full couriers just leave packages in the room. The existence of this locker created a huge security issue and serves to benefit the couriers only.  Tired of driving across the property to hopefully retrieve a package(if it works and was placed properly) that I've paid to have delivered to my door.  This entire system can burn to the ground and be buried for all I care.  Customer service is non existent.  No real solutions or accountability when you can get ahold of them.  The worst experience dealing with mail delivery in my entire lifeDate of experience: December 09, 2022LALawrence2 reviewsUSUpdated May 9, 2024Parcel Pending--Excuse Without MeritParcel Pending has had the parcel locker contract at Legacy Pines (current name) in Flagstaff for years.Parcel Pending system is down more than it is functional, often for weeks at a time. And since USPS is worthless--in that they won't deliver to individual apartments--this leaves only the overworked Legacy Pines staff to accept and then distribute packages. Since USPS often shows up at the apartment complex when the Legacy Pines Office is closed, this further delays the process.Parcel Pending should be replaced by a competent parcel locker service.I did speak with Parcel Pending and they blamed Legacy Pines and said their Internet didn't work.Legacy Pines showed me the new Router they had acquired for the Parcel Pending system. The Property Manager Katherine Sedillo and I then went to the Parcel Pending Console with our iPhones and saw the Legacy Pines - Parcel Pending Internet was active.Still no Parcel PendingDate of experience: April 30, 2024Reply from Parcel Pending by QuadientMay 9, 2024Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us.

If it was allowed, I’d use much stronger language. I picked up my package and kept getting notifications that I hadn’t picked it up. So they started charging  me. Because they charged too many times, for a nonexistent package, my account got a ton of overdraft fees!!! It took a month for them to 1. NEVER CALL ME BACK and 2. Tell me to just have the bank fix the overdraft (after I told them the bank wouldn’t) because they refused to take responsibility for their error. Total garbage.

Either it's not working and we can't get our package out, the carriers don't use them and bring the package to the door or as in one case, the package was folded and jammed into the locker and it was a painting. Right now, I am curious about a package that they said wouldn't fit and was delivered to the office, but the office didn't have it. In any case, it is a service that I am forced to pay for that has really been a waste of money. Peace of mind???

I picked up my package on time as I do every time I get a notification. Then I got a notification that I'm being charged for not picking up my package. Which I picked up on time. The charge went to an old credit card I dont use anymore and was declined. I called customer service and they fixed the problem. Next day I start getting 2 notifications that Im being charged a late fee again for the same mistake which again is declined. I called again and now Im told that I need to add a new card so they can charge me again. Then I am suppose file a complaint for a refund. And they will keep charging me till I add a new card. I said just cancel me. I dont have time for this nonsense where they dont have their S together with tech. I absolutely dont trust them with new credit card. And now I dont get my $20 fee back.

The first time unfortunately someone had already stolen my 300+ gift but the rep I spoke to did EVERYTHING in his power to help me. Yesterday I had the same thing happen to me but the first rep we spoke to did not help AT ALL! his only response was I can't help because we can't verify if someone else's package was there and didn't want to be held liable, to a certain extent I understand but customer service should be a TOP priority. I called again and THANK GOD FOR Jessie Romo - Bilingual Customer Relations. When I tell you she saved the day yesterday she provided top-tier customer service and I am very grateful to her.

I placed an order that was supposed to be delivered on November 6th. I specifically stayed home that day just to receive this package as quickly as possible. While checking their live tracking website, I saw the driver was nearby, so I waited by the door, ready to answer. No knock, no doorbell—nothing. Then I check the tracking again, and it says “customer not answering.” I was literally there, waiting! I immediately sent an email saying that if they couldn't find me, they could leave it downstairs. Did they do that? No. Instead, I got a message saying “sorry,” and that they would attempt delivery the next day.So, for the second day in a row, I stayed home specifically for this package. This time, the app said “cannot find address.” Really? I reached out again to explain I was home and provided my address details, but I got the same empty apologies and promises to deliver “as soon as possible.”Today, I emailed them again to ask if they could deliver to a different address, but I received no response—same story with my follow-up email. Is there a phone number to call? Nope. Just dead silence.Honestly, this company is frustrating and unprofessional. They have poor communication, unreliable delivery, and zero accountability. Avoid them if you value your time and sanity!Date of experience: November 08, 2024Reply from Peddler.com2 days agoDear Ahmed,I'm very sorry to hear about your disappointing experience.

I contacted Peddler two days after it was delivered to find out how I could return it as I could not see an option in my customer account to create a return. I did not receive a response after 5 days so I sent them an email and it is now another 4 days and still no response. Considering the seller has a 14 day return policy, I am weary that I would be stuck with a bulky item I do not need!

No reply. Now a week later i check the track and trace, which states that it was attempted again (without pre notification or a mail after) and now my package it returned to the sender. Apperently there were zero neighbors at home at that time in my complex of 40 people, mostly hosting elderlies.Worst experience ever, avoid at all costs.

Although a 2 hr time window for pick up service is arranged they only pick up on-time 50% of the time. They do not update their ETA delivery/stats pages.   I am left waiting for a person to pick up the goods and then have to explain to my customers why their delivery is going to be late.  I have waited for over 3 weeks to get a refund on a pick up order that I had to cancel and deliver my self... because the courier could not pick it up nor could I be given a real ETA of when they could do so.  I have used their pickup/delivery service for most of 2022 with a 50% success rate of them picking up in the window of time reserved.On a positive note, I can always get them on the phone to speak to a customer service person.Date of experience: December 09, 2022JUJulian16 reviewsGBMar 24, 2020VerifiedCheaper than buying directly.Cheaper than buying directly from the store and delivered really quickly.

Volgens onze gegevens staat de levering van uw pakket geregistreerd als succesvol afgerond om 17:00, en op dat moment is het pakket op de juiste locatie ook als afgeleverd aangegeven door onze rider. Het lijkt erop dat er mogelijk een probleem is met de tijdsaanduiding in de andere track & trace, alhoewel ik niet weet welke track & trace dit betreft. Volgens onze informatie zou het pakket in uw mailbox zijn bezorgd. Mocht u het pakket hier niet kunnen vinden, verzoeken wij u vriendelijk om contact op te nemen met onze helpdesk via helpdesk@peddler.com.

The emails about delivery from 9 AM to 9 PM can reach me at 6 PM after the delivery attempt, or maybe 10 minutes before - at best. 2) Last time they attempted to deliver my parcel, but it failed because the \"distribution center forgot to pack my package in the delivery person's bike.\" I am convinced that they lost my package but can't tell me directly. They continue to lie, stating that the parcel will be delivered in 1-2 business days since August 10th. Every time I send an email to customer service, they update the \"estimated delivery time\" in the tracker - and that's it. If I could choose to never use this company, I would. Unfortunately, online shops sometimes choose them for me as a last-mile delivery option, and it is a pain each and every time.Date of experience: August 25, 2024Reply from Peddler.comAug 26, 2024Dear Helena,Thank you for your feedback.

Had booked a trip to Mexico and they double charged us on our payments. To make matters even worse, we had fully paid our trip off and come to find out, that the company collapsed and is filing for bankruptcy. We did not get any of our money back and basically wasted $1,099! They did not let us know or anything, as they did not respond back to any emails. The only way I had found out that the company had collapsed, was by searching the company on the internet and then boom I found a ton of articles! When I tell you I was shocked! The company was messy, giving alcohol to minors and doing drugs in the office! If you can do drugs, you can respond back to my emails! Stop playing with me and my money. In conclusion, the company no longer exists and if you had booked through them, you will not see your moeny refunded back to you.Date of experience: January 25, 2023Read 4 more reviews about PollenMatt P1 reviewGBFeb 2, 2023Scammed!!!

After various emails I got fed up and looked into the company. IT'S GONE BUST. They owe many people lots of refunds.I googled how to get my money back from a bust company and my bank have helped me.I have just completed the TSB  dispute form and am now a little more confident in receiving my refund; initially from the bank who will then make their bid to the people handling Pollen's predicament.Hope this helps others get their refunds from Pollen...Date of experience: September 01, 2022Read 1 more review about PollenAdvertisementNatália Manica Santos1 reviewBRJul 28, 2022UnforgettableLooking back, the whole experience feels like a dream.

We ended up cancelling before our first monthly payment was due, because of suspicion towards Pollen. Sure enough, we were not only charged for a trip we cancelled, but many were charged for TWO monthly payments. It took two months to get refunded and some are still waiting on their refunds.

The company has definitely gone bankrupt, cancelled all of their promoted events and removed them from their website. I bought two passes to Diplos Higher Ground Cabo in 2021 and requested a refund in January 2022 when it was postponed (now cancelled) and they stop replying to my emails in April after saying my refund was processed - which it wasn't. Have tried reaching out to them on instagram + email since and no response. It is now end of August. This company makes fyre festival look like the golden child. Hoping these stories reach a bigger media presence as they need to be held accountable for their actions.Date of experience: August 30, 2022BGBarbara Guevara2 reviewsUSNov 2, 2022This company went into BankruptcyThis company went into Bankruptcy, they took my money and they are not refunding it.

Unfortunately, I had covid so couldn't attend. Their first covid policy stated that if you get covid, you are issued a full refund. Once I sent evidence of my PCR, they said I would be receiving my refund within 90 days...They're now ignoring all attempts of contact, the company is going bust and I really need my money back.

Everything was communicated clearly about the schedule. I would say the price is a bit higher than necessary but totally worth it for the line-up. The drinks were way overpriced too... but at least they're optional. The food was okay priced just the drinks... like 8 euro for a beer come on. I loved that people were handing out water during the whole event to people in front of the stage and the security team did their job perfectly as a tiny girl who was in front of the stage and had to deal with  the crowd surfers. Everyone was very helpful and always answered my questions or found a person to do so.The only thing I would change is to put WC in front of the festival grounds for people queuing.Date of experience: July 27, 2022AdvertisementRSRS1 reviewUSDec 20, 2022Pollen is CORRUPT, THIEVES, SCAM ARTISTSPollen charged my daughter $499 for a May, 2022 trip from Dayton to Daytona.

It is now December 20, 2022. The last correspondence they provided in response to my daughter's request for the money they stole from her was on July 11, 2022 and Pollen/pollen.co stated they have 90 days to issue her refund and would be working to exceed that.

Delivery was prompt, however of the two boxes this item was sent in only one was delivered to the door intact. The other portion was unboxed in the truck and handed to me at the door. Unfortunately they were gone by the time I realized they drove away with the box that held all of the hardware and instructions to put it together! Called Ryder office immediately and they punted me off to Pottery Barn rather than bring back what they took. Two weeks later I’m STILL waiting for said hardware because PB had to order it from an overseas vendor. I don’t fault PB because they’re great about taping hardware to inside box with a red ribbon attached so it can’t be missed. Ryder, however, couldn’t be bothered to bring back the box with the hardware they took!Date of experience: March 03, 2023AdvertisementDKDarta Kurotsuchi1 reviewUSOct 2, 2019Driver cut me off and ran a red lightDriver cut me off and ran a red light.

An automated message gives me prompts to direct my call. The prompts do not have a compalints or cx. Service line. After hitting a number to get to a rep a new automated message tells me the office is closed and hangs up on me.

After the first 2 trouble tickets they sent me pictures of the product delivered to the wrong address and continuously assured me that 1- They had done their part 2- I was at fault and 3- To refer to the picture of the delivered product. I had to send several emails all with brand new customer support tickets (as I was instructed to do at the end of each email along with being told I had received my product). Even after calling and being promised they would get back to me, it’s been a week since the call and nothing. The craziest part is that they have delivered to my house from the same site on 3 separate occasions this year alone. The address is saved on the site, and if they take pictures of deliveries, then they could easily just look at the home in the 3 other deliveries and see they messed up. Their customer service is horrible.  I’d much rather have my packages delivered by USPS. At least they know how to properly follow a gps.Date of experience: June 11, 2024JDJoseph Diggs3 reviewsUSMay 10, 2024Nonexistent customer service and theftNonexistent customer service and zero accountability. Rampant theft. I have had many deliveries from StockX. Never an issue or delay, when UPS or FedEx was the company tasked with delivery after authentication. However, whenever packages are delivered by this company, my shoes never arrive or become “lost” during shipment from their facility. The company's use of “independent” contractors seem to have contributed to the theft of packages. The management offer no accountability, apology, or remedy for the issue. You can literally see a timetable of when your package was stolen. The company is either complicit in the thefts or don't care about the issue. It has been two weeks and no one from management has contacted me concerning the incident.Date of experience: April 15, 2024MRMaria Rivera5 reviewsUSUpdated Nov 2, 2021Delivered to wrong address twice!Purchased an item from Zulilly.

Customer service keeps saying they have submitted the complaint to higher but haven't heard back from them.

After seeing my package was out for delivery, I expected it within the day, but came to find it was marked as undeliverable due to denied access.  This was obviously a lie as the same day TFORCE claimed to be attempting delivery, I also received a delivery from Amazon.  The Amazon driver was able to use the keypad at my apartment building and I was able to allow them access to my building.  The next day TFORCE again claimed to be out for delivery and again claimed to have been denied access to my building.  At the end of day two, my package was marked as \"return to sender\". I checked the front of my building and our mail room, there was no pick up slip left by the delivery driver.  The fact that their drivers are not trained on how apartment buildings work and do not allow for later pick up is so strange.  When I contacted their customer service I was told once packages are returned to sender it is out of their hands.  When I asked why my buzzer was never rung or why I was never called to grant building access I never received a response.Date of experience: November 04, 2021Eddy J.

I have 2 signs on my apartment door in clear, big lettering saying Day Sleeper, do not disturb. I have several companies who deliver packages. They ALL respect my signs and privacy and NEVER knock on my door. They leave the package. Uniuni came to my door yesterday, midday and pounded on my door waking me out of a deep sleep. When I finally stumbled to the door they were gone and left a small order. Not everyone works days. Some people work nights. I will NEVER order from another company, in this case Bloomchic, that uses uniuni as a delivery carrier again.Date of experience: November 11, 2024ANanaboreya4 reviewsCA3 days agoThey take pictures of your car's licence plate.They take pictures of my car's licence plate when there is no reason to and is a concern for my privacy, my vehicle's licence plate is irrelevent to the parcel's delivery which should include a photo of the package and the house ONLY.Ive heard some bad things about this company, particularly with their drivers stealing the packages, it's a fortune that I have cameras present in my porch otherwise who knows what would have happened to my packages.Date of experience: November 09, 2024Chelsea McWhirter Doyen1 reviewUS12 hours agoHorrible companyHorrible company. Unreliable. No communication. Don't receive packages and never by date expected. You might as well ask for a refund. US should ban them.Date of experience: November 10, 2024KEKeegan2 reviewsUS5 days agoDriver stole my packageDriver stole my package. Rather than actually deliver my package, the driver took pictures of my package in front of my building as proof of delivery, but never actually left the package. Their proof of delivery was false. I called their \"contact the courier\" number at 18002822468 and received a busy signal over 10 times! UniUni is a dishonest shipping company and stole my package. I don't understand why any vendor would use them and I don't understand how Uniuni is still in business. They should be sued and shut down Date of experience: November 07, 2024Geto Suguru1 reviewCA3 days agoI would have given zero starsI would have given zero stars. My first time with Uniuni delivery experience.So how are you guys going to compensate for the lost hour of mine that i had waited without going for some work waiting for the delivery???The driver did not come here and it shows delivery attempted???? Are you kidding me??? I am standing here for the last 1 hour. The driver did not even get her!! i want my package today or let me know where can i pick it up from????Date of experience: November 10, 2024Coffee Time And Travel3 reviewsUS4 days agoHere's another one for the books.Here's another one for the books.. The driver took a picture of my order plus a number of other bags behind it standing in front of my house.. The order contained a ring that I'm sure was felt through the package.. there was a picture of the package on my porch... when I went to look the bag was thrown in front of my driveway opened up and items including the ring gone.  I've lived in my home for almost 30 yrs and not once have I had a package stolen.  I wish Aliexpress would stop using them. smh, today I'm waiting for my order again hopefully I'll actually get what I ordered from them this time.

I ordered from Cosplay Show on October 18. UniUni received it stateside on October 22. Since October 24, the website has said my package was routed to the wrong site. No updates. Every time I contact customer service, they tell me that they are working on sending my package. It has been 2 weeks! I am sure my package is lost and I have no recourse to get a refund now. Never again.Date of experience: October 24, 2024Selwan Elsherbeeny1 reviewUSNov 5, 2024Scams Scams , delivery attempts never made , they do not make a second attempt ,  claimed first attempt made Sunday at 9:17 am while business was closed as most business are closed at this time  .Date of experience: November 04, 2024ANAndrew1 reviewCANov 6, 2024UNIUNI Is a DisgraceEVERY time I have the misfortune of being involved with this garbage company, there's a problem. Just today I received the last thing I will ever buy on ebay that isn't shipped Canada Post. EVERY time, uni rings the bell, I tell them I am in a wheelchair and can't go down 3 flights of stairs to pick up package and ask them to bring it up. EVERY time their drivers say \"sure\" then leave in the lobby for anyone to help themselves to. EVERY time! They also lie and say they are from amazon to get folks to let them in the building. The WORST company by far!Date of experience: November 05, 2024IBIllegitimate business detector1 reviewUSNov 2, 2024Buyer be savvy, buyer BEWARE!! These scam artists really know what they're doing! They pretend to deliver packages, send random photos of the package in locations nowhere near the delivery location to claim it was delivered, and then presumably re-sell the package contents online through one of several irreputable sites. If the place you intend to purchase items from online uses uniuni for any of their delivery needs, DO NOT purchase anything from that site! Whether the site itself is in on the scam or not, the likelihood of you receiving what you pay for is dismally low, and the customer service department at uniuni does not actually exist. Not sure the best way to report these interstate scams, but if anyone out there knows how, please do! Date of experience: October 17, 2024KGKimberly Gower-Hall4 reviewsUSNov 1, 2024Tracking said my package was delivered…Tracking said my package was delivered on 10/27/24, but I never received the package and when I went into the UniUni tracking, there were 3 pictures and the house shown was NOT mine.  Either the delivery driver delivered my package to the wrong address or stole the package and took a bogus photo.  I contacted UniUni  customer service and waited on hold only to get disconnected and called back and waited another 15 minutes. They do nothing to investigate where your package was misdelivered and they sent a letter to me saying to contact the seller to resolve the issue.  Date of experience: October 27, 2024JLJohn L1 reviewUSOct 30, 2024Package left at wrong address or driver stolePackage said delivered at 1030pm at night.  \"Proof of Delivery\" is 2 pics of the driver holding it in his car.  Since it was not even left at a door, I can guess the driver stole the package.  Uni does not care, both phone numbers will not ring.  Multiple support tickets via website and direct email with no reply.  Look at all the 1 star reviews, they KNOW their drivers are stealing packages and do not care.  If Aliexpress does not refund I will chargeback on my VISA card.Date of experience: October 29, 2024COConsumer1 reviewUSOct 29, 2024Not good at all S-L-O-W Not good at all S-L-O-W .  Package was in my city for over 10 days before they delivered.  Then claimed the address was wrong ( it was not ).  Then took another 10 days to redeliver.  Once again thi9s was ll while the package was in my city according to tracking.Date of experience: October 20, 2024Tabitha-Jean Shaw2 reviewsCAOct 29, 2024Disorganized and zero customer service They estimated delivery on 23 Oct, the delivery driver attempted delivery on 27 Oct, but didn’t call, as per the delivery instructions. I had no contact up to that point to let me know the delivery was on the way. The first communication I received from them was that they weren’t able to deliver my parcel. Instead of leaving it in the lobby, they left with it. I submitted a re delivery request on 27 Oct. They emailed the sender on 28 Oct that my parcel delivery has been suspended?! I have been in line to speak to a customer service representative for 45 minutes. The first three calls were dropped without being answered. This is no way to run a delivery service company. Date of experience: October 29, 2024Flavio Portella2 reviewsUSOct 23, 2024If I could I would give negative starsIf I could I would give negative stars. They said my package was delivered but the photo they took inside of a building was not of my building. I took forever to get ahold of a customer service person and they opened a ticket. They asked for pics of my building and after “careful review” they admitted the package was delivered to the wrong address and told me to contact the seller. Worst service and worst experience ever. Date of experience: October 20, 2024KRKristen2 reviewsUSOct 30, 2024Worst parcel company everI ordered bras from shapermint. I see that on a Sunday uni uni tried to deliver but was unsuccessful. That's fair because I live inside an apartment building that's secure and leasing is only open from 1-5 and maybe they don't have access like some of the bigger carriers. I set up for another delivery as their site says they're to make 2 attempts. Nothing, they never tried again. I scheduled for a re delivery as they said maybe my address was wrong. It was not. Nothing happened for 2 days. I finally called and asked for the product to be re shipped and was told they'd update my order w a new tracking number. I just had another ticket placed that I had an issue but no resolve. Another 2 days I see my package was sitting at the warehouse. I call again and was told this would be escalated to their supervisor because I expressed my frustration. Within 24 hours the \"supervisor\" emailed me that they don't deliver to my area and contact the company I bought from to use another service. Meanwhile, the day before I saw two uni uni packages for another tenant in the mail room and I live in a big city, not a rural town,  for them to say that. They're horrible and liars. I'll deal w companies that don't use them and because of them Shapermint had to refund me but after more back and forth. Date of experience: October 25, 2024Tashja J1 reviewCANov 5, 2024WORST DELIVERY COMPANY I've had 2 deliveries. The first one was left on the street in front of my house.It, of course got stolen. And the second,made it 3 feet up the driveway,where it sat in the rain for 6 hours.I have a carport AND a door...take the extra 10 steps 🤦Date of experience: November 05, 2024WWWanda Williams5 reviewsUSOct 18, 2024Tracking indicated that my package was…Tracking indicated that my package was out for delivery on 10/9. I submitted a support ticket next thing I got was that there was an attempted delivery and that they would attempt to redeliver in 24 to 48 hours. Still no package. I called the customer service number and the rep just read from a script the same information I get on the site or through the chatbot. They are ridiculous. I am contacting the sellerDate of experience: October 09, 2024LILinda2 reviewsUSAug 12, 2024I was a little skeptical when SHEIN…I was a little skeptical when SHEIN switch courier service to UniUni. I was use to my packages coming from USPS or SpeedEx. I’ve seen all these negative reviews and was surprised. Thank God I’ve never had any issues.  Packages usually delivered early and on a Saturday. Date of experience: August 12, 2024Julie Berset2 reviewsUSOct 13, 2024Wrong address- lie- UNI UNI is STEALING the packagespackage was out for delivery, 9/26.  Never delivered.  checked tracking and it was returned to warehouse because of incorrect address.  The address is correct and an easy to access single family home with no gate codes etc.  the order was a large order split into 3 shipments, 2 of which came from another carrier no problem.    i have emailed with Customer service  for over 2 weeks and they still wont tell me where my package is or schedule it for redelivery.

That's the reason they got two stars instead of one--and that means they did the bare minimum. If you want to use a bare minimum company, these folks are for you!I ordered an item online from someone other than Amazon--something I rarely do. Instead of delivering the package to my door (and dropping it behind a large pillar so it's not visible to package thieves), the lazy slug who delivered my item left it in plain view in front of my garage door. Fortunately, I was working from home and have security cameras that give me alerts, so I was able to retrieve the package almost immediately. How lazy are these drivers/delivery people? Too lazy to walk another 50 feet to ensure my package was out of sight at my doorstep? I'm writing the vendor (from which I'd planned to order other items) to tell them I will NOT order from them again if they are going to use UniUni to deliver. Amazon, FedEx and UPS have spoiled us. Even the USPS is a cut above these goofballs. Date of experience: September 27, 2024ALAlly1 reviewUSOct 16, 2024Delivered to wrong addressDelivered to wrong address. Company provided proof that it was delivered to wrong address. Tried to call multiple times to resolve issue. The last time I called, the representative hung up on me. Still not resolve for them delivering my package to the wrong address. I would avoid shipping with them. Date of experience: October 01, 2024Cassandra Smith1 reviewUSOct 26, 2024I’m not exaggerating when I say that…I’m not exaggerating when I say that UniUni is the absolute worst delivery service I’ve ever encountered. They steal packages, lie about deliveries, and provide false information about delivery attempts. I’ve been forced to stop shopping at stores like SHEIN, Temu, and LuvMe Hair because they all use this unreliable courier to save a few bucks.Since July, I haven’t received any packages at my address, and after I complained, they claimed they no longer deliver to my location. This feels like retaliation, especially since they had previously accepted my packages for delivery. Their customer service is a complete joke and they don’t answer the phone. If you email them, they take days to reply. I’ve had to dispute charges for packages that were never received and have reported UniUni to the BBB and the state attorney general multiple times.Despite the overwhelming number of complaints, they still operate without accountability. I’ve documented every failed delivery and saved all customer service exchanges. It’s outrageous that they’re allowed to handle packages when they consistently fail to deliver. Avoid UniUni at all costs!Date of experience: October 16, 2024SSSS2 reviewsCAOct 5, 2024Absolute dog courier serviceAbsolute dog courier service. Out of town and received a notice that a package was being shipped to me unexpectedly. Phoned CS prior to package arriving at the depot. Asked them to hold it until the following week. CS said certainly, sent a follow-up email that it would be delivered the following week. 1-2 days later receive notice that they've delivered the package. Asked neighbour to collect it for me. Neighbour can't find it. I find it upon return - half opened, thrown behind the bushes instead of in the mailbox, on the porch table, or literally anywhere else under a roof & out of sight. Date of experience: May 02, 2024Lynette Shirley6 reviewsCAJun 8, 2024Hi thank you so much Uni!Hi thank you so much Uni, that's an awesome delivery process.  I see you are very security conscious and that is much appreciated in a large complex condo area. The courier phoned first, before leaving it anywhere as our security doors are always locked. Love that they took a photo of delivery, and my husband receiving it. Keep up the great work!kind regards, Lynette.Date of experience: June 07, 2024SOSofia1 reviewUSOct 9, 2024Suspicious behavior for delivery manDelivery driver for uniuni delivery opened my front door and peeked inside my home. The company wasn’t too concerned when I told them about their driver. Becareful they deliver many packages for shein, Temu, and tiktokshop.

I reported this to the company and they did not deny it, they just told me that once a package has been successfully delivered it's no longer their responsibility. Clearly the drivers will continue doing this because the company doesn't even care.Date of experience: October 07, 2024Pa Pe1 reviewUSOct 1, 2024Absolutely the worst, and they don't care.I have had several packages delivered by Uni Uni.  The first time, the delivery driver threw the soft package into my yard from the delivery van.  The second time, the driver left the package in my driveway in full view of everyone.  But the worst experience I had with them was when they refused to deliver to a post office box at the UPS store because they are a \"competitor.\" The thing I had been waiting for was a memorial picture of my husband, who died suddenly.  I would give negative stars if I could.Date of experience: September 28, 2024Steven Mead1 reviewUSOct 11, 2024Delivered my package to the wrong…Delivered my package to the wrong address.

Absolutely useless garbage company and garbage people working for themDate of experience: September 18, 2024NFNeil Freed12 reviewsUSOct 9, 2024I have had two sellers use UniUni on…I have had two sellers use UniUni and both times the package has been delivered to the incorrect address, and lost. The most recent from eBay. Resulting in a refund in the first one and they are currently looking for the second package. They notified me it was delivered and I went out immediately to get it and surprise, it was not there. It was impossible to tell where it was delivered in their picture but it was not delivered to the address on the package. It will likely end up in a second refund. Now I will ask what delivery service is used BEFORE I purchase anything on eBay, or any where else.. If it is UniUni I will buy from a different seller or do without.Date of experience: October 07, 2024GRAHAM HANDSWORTH2 reviewsCAOct 27, 2024Delivery drivers who abuse customers…Delivery drivers who abuse customers animals.

The LAZY delivery guy rings the intercom enters the building and then proceeds to leave my package downstairs in the common area where hundreds of people leave and enters the building. He then takes a photo as if he delivered to my address.  I do NOT live downstairs!! I tried to call this company to complain nobody answered the phone. If i didn't have a surveillance camera to watch him as he left the package I am sure my package would've gone missing! Date of experience: July 11, 2024Gabriel Arrarás1 reviewUSOct 30, 2024UniUni Employs CriminalsI had an absolutely appalling experience with UniUni that I feel compelled to share. On October 24, 2024, one of their delivery drivers not only delivered our package but also stole my wife's phone right off our front porch! This happened while my wife was momentarily distracted, taking our two-month-old child out of the car and into the house.We immediately reached out to UniUni multiple times, desperately seeking their assistance in the active police investigation. The police were tracking the stolen phone via GPS and needed information about the driver to apprehend them. Shockingly, UniUni failed to provide any meaningful help or cooperation. Their complete lack of responsiveness and disregard for the seriousness of the situation is beyond unacceptable.It's deeply concerning that UniUni employs individuals who engage in criminal behavior and then refuses to take responsibility or assist in rectifying the situation. This raises serious questions about their hiring practices and whether they conduct proper background checks on their employees.I strongly advise anyone considering using UniUni's services to think twice. Their negligence and indifference have caused our family immense stress and violated our sense of security in our own home. Companies like this should not be in business if they can't ensure the safety and trustworthiness of their employees.Would give zero stars if possible.Date of experience: October 24, 2024Steph Donmoyer1 reviewUSOct 1, 2024My package was delivered to the wrong…My package was delivered to the wrong address, even the pic in tracking shows this.  It is impossible to reach anyone by phone.  I have tried multiple times and after 30 mins or so when it say I have a few minutes left to wait the call is disconnected.  I have filed two tickets via the alternate chat and nobody has responded in the last 11 days!!!!!!   I need a form so the company will reimburse my loss!!!!!!!!! Why is this so difficult????Date of experience: September 20, 2024Luis Oquendo1 reviewUSOct 3, 2024The worst delivery company everThe worst delivery company ever. I have an order from Temu that comes through this company and they supposedly couldn't deliver it. They say they came twice and when I checked my security cameras NO ONE came at the time the driver says. They return my package to the warehouse when they do a mediocre job.Date of experience: October 01, 2024Lala Alvarez3 reviewsUSOct 1, 2024SCAM AND A HALF! THIEVES!Placed an order from Temu and they used this joke of a \"business\" UniUni for delivery services. Pictures showing delivery are no where near what my address even looks like, and good luck contacting tthem. I put in several requests online about missing parcel and no response, then called the number to be placed on hold to speak to an agent for 28 minutes and when it finally rang to connect me there was no one at the other end and then it hung up on me. So now I have no package and no response. Will be disputing charges and contacting Temu as this apparently is the norm from them. Neither company will get my business again.Date of experience: September 25, 2024Altavya Hannah1 reviewUSOct 11, 2024This is a scam serviceThis is a scam service. First of all who are you guys. Like I’ve never heard of you. First red flag. Second they took a picture of the “delivering my package” in the parking lot. It didn’t show exactly which apartment and from the picture they weren’t even by my apartment. I wouldn’t reccommend this service Date of experience: October 10, 2024Mariam Fanna1 reviewUSOct 2, 2024SCAM!They emailed that my package was delivered and shared photos, photos from outside the building. I LITERALLY CHECKED RIGHT AFTER THE EMAIL and there was no package whatsoever! They also shared a photo of the door or a package but not a photo of when they left the package inside the building like all couriers do!!!!

No wonder I never heard of them until now(!)Horrible company. I purchased some items from an online vendor, only to not receive the delivery when it was supposed to arrive. I start clicking thru the status links and land on a page for \"UniUni\". It says they returned the package to their warehouse undelivered because it had the \"wrong address\". I had no idea what \"UniUni\" was until I looked them up, and discovered they are the delivery equivalent of a labrador retriever designing nuclear weapons- wholly incompetent. I have attempted several inquiries thru their website, with each rejected as a website failure. I would rather the vendor add in the fee for delivery by the known providers UPS, FedEx, or USPS than save a few coins by using this scam of a \"delivery company\".

I had instructed them via customer support to text and leave it at the door--they didn't do that! It only takes one missed called to end up in this black hole after second attempt.

I think the driver simply doesn’t want to drive out to my house. Emails go unanswered, trouble tickets go unanswered, after waiting on hold for 40 minutes, the gentleman said would reschedule delivery and call me back within 48 hours. Been 4 days, no call back. Sellers simply refund without helping about getting your package. That doesn’t help when they don’t refund shipping cost, so UniUni gets paid for not doing anything. Zero customer service, clearly crap at moving parcels. Date of experience: August 14, 2024Khandigirl Sunshine1 reviewUSSep 11, 2024Terrible delivery service …I order from a company and the uniuni delivery left it outside of the main apartment building. Attempted to make contact with them several times without success. Order the same items a second time hoping for a better outcome,  but no. Uniuni put failed delivery attempt and unable to contact. This is interesting since I was home all day and there is an apartment callbox which was never used. Still attempting to talk to someone.

I am an employee at USPS and I work at the front desk where all the other carriers come in to bring packages but I can’t seem to get my package from this carrier service. The Customer Service representative “claims” they are going to investigate the driver and that the driver is to CALL ME when they redeliver. So I wake up this morning.. (Sunday) to another “attempted” delivery. We are CLOSED ON SUNDAYS! And nobody contacted me. This is THE WORST DELIVERY SERVICE! And as a customer we should have the option on what carrier we want to deliver our packages. I would never in my life choose this company!

This company has made it a point to not deliver to US military bases. (And you are often not told uniuni will be the delivering company until it is too late.) Either they are hiring drivers that can't pass a basic very quick background check, or don't have valid ID or insurance. This is not a hard thing. They really really do not care at all about the troops as they have a policy about this that blames the victim who can't get their package and then the vender says it is a uniuni issue and around and around it goes. Do you want your company to look like they hate veterans or are shady AF, than by all means use UniUni. Date of experience: August 30, 2024MIMichelle3 reviewsUSUpdated Oct 31, 2024uniuni is not to be trustedmy package was marked as a missed delivery for “contact failed + inaccessible.” I was home, awake and no one called me nor did they come by my home as at the time, 724am I was drinking my morning coffee in my living room looking out the window as I usually do. I find it hard to believe the time elapsed between out for delivery and missed delivery, 15 min, is reflective of them trying to deliver at all. I called when I noticed this by the afternoon when I checked tracking as absolutely no contact or update had been made. Customer service ended up informing me it could take up to ten additional days for a second attempt as they need to investigate ME for fraud as people keep saying their packages are stolen when they are delivered, I ask how this is relevant to my issue as THEY marked they didn’t deliver and he kept repeating the line about fraud being the reason. I never got an actual answer who knows if ill get my package but I will be reaching out to the seller. update:despite scheduling a redelivery the same day as the missed delivery they went ahead and returned my package to sender, I will never buy from cider again due to this experience.

The driver threw my packages over my gate fence instead of putting in a clearly marked basket for delivery packages. This resulted in damage to one of the items and I couldn’t open my gate to enter my property as the packages were blocking the swing open gates.

They said they  tried to deliver my package at 10pm while the business was closed. They never left a notification of the attempted  delivery. Then  they  returned my package without any kind of notification. When I left a message on their  website  they  never  answered me back. When I checked my stores security camera,  there never was an attempted  delivery to begin with.

Date of experience: October 09, 2024ANAnna1 reviewUSUpdated Sep 25, 2024Kiss Your Packages GoodbyeSTAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY AND BLOCK THEM FOR DELIVERY IF POSSIBLE. I ordered some items on Temu, which usually has expedited delivery. It had been two weeks, so, I decided to check on the status of my package. UniUni claims that they tried to deliver, but my address was wrong. It's the same address I use for all of my orders. So, I called UniUni and after being placed on hold for a while, the rep informs me that they will attempt a second delivery in a few days. The alleged delivery day is tomorrow and today, I got a notification that my package will not be delivered because it's been returned to the Temu warehouse. I called again to ask about the situation and the rep gaslit me. He kept disagreeing me with by saying \"No, miss\" whenever I spoke. Rude employees and terrible delivery service.Date of experience: September 23, 2024Colin Chicoine1 reviewCAJul 29, 2024Incompetent employeesIncompetent employees.

This is truly frustrating as I shop with aliexpress often and have never had an issue with delivery. Now this makes me not want to order anything else if this is the parcel company they will be using. Very bad for business.

Worst experience encountered with them. I ordered a package from commense and did not recieve any. Even after multiple follow ups, all they said was they would get back within 48hrs which was not true . I had to follow up on them every alternate days. They dont reply to emails and their call wait time takes forever. After almost 2 months of follow up , they tell me the parcel is returned to the seller. It’s frustrating and waste of time and money. If this continues no wonder the company will shut down.

Date of experience: October 28, 2024Read 1 more review about UniuniCHChuck1 reviewUSSep 16, 2024The delivery was messed up, and web site and customer support do not work.What went wrong?  First the driver says that the package wasn't delivered because of the weather, but it is sunny outside.  I think they were possibly under a time constraint and just didn't even try.  Second the web site does not accept the tracking number.  I have experience in web site design, and I think this web site is very bad in general, but that it just doesn't work is a kicker.When I came in to leave a complaint about the Company, I noticed 91% of the reviews are 1 star.  The same is true of experiences on Reddit.  Can I say I am not surprised.  In my opinion this is among the worst managed companies I can imagine.  If it had stock I would short it because it is a sure bet to fail.

I have 2 signs on my apartment door in clear, big lettering saying Day Sleeper, do not disturb. I have several companies who deliver packages. They ALL respect my signs and privacy and NEVER knock on my door. They leave the package. Uniuni came to my door yesterday, midday and pounded on my door waking me out of a deep sleep. When I finally stumbled to the door they were gone and left a small order. Not everyone works days. Some people work nights. I will NEVER order from another company, in this case Bloomchic, that uses uniuni as a delivery carrier again.Date of experience: November 11, 2024ANanaboreya4 reviewsCA3 days agoThey take pictures of your car's licence plate.They take pictures of my car's licence plate when there is no reason to and is a concern for my privacy, my vehicle's licence plate is irrelevent to the parcel's delivery which should include a photo of the package and the house ONLY.Ive heard some bad things about this company, particularly with their drivers stealing the packages, it's a fortune that I have cameras present in my porch otherwise who knows what would have happened to my packages.Date of experience: November 09, 2024Chelsea McWhirter Doyen1 reviewUS12 hours agoHorrible companyHorrible company.

Just today I received the last thing I will ever buy on ebay that isn't shipped Canada Post. EVERY time, uni rings the bell, I tell them I am in a wheelchair and can't go down 3 flights of stairs to pick up package and ask them to bring it up. EVERY time their drivers say \"sure\" then leave in the lobby for anyone to help themselves to. EVERY time! They also lie and say they are from amazon to get folks to let them in the building. The WORST company by far!Date of experience: November 05, 2024IBIllegitimate business detector1 reviewUSNov 2, 2024Buyer be savvy, buyer BEWARE!! These scam artists really know what they're doing! They pretend to deliver packages, send random photos of the package in locations nowhere near the delivery location to claim it was delivered, and then presumably re-sell the package contents online through one of several irreputable sites. If the place you intend to purchase items from online uses uniuni for any of their delivery needs, DO NOT purchase anything from that site! Whether the site itself is in on the scam or not, the likelihood of you receiving what you pay for is dismally low, and the customer service department at uniuni does not actually exist. Not sure the best way to report these interstate scams, but if anyone out there knows how, please do!

Either the delivery driver delivered my package to the wrong address or stole the package and took a bogus photo.  I contacted UniUni  customer service and waited on hold only to get disconnected and called back and waited another 15 minutes. They do nothing to investigate where your package was misdelivered and they sent a letter to me saying to contact the seller to resolve the issue.

Since it was not even left at a door, I can guess the driver stole the package.  Uni does not care, both phone numbers will not ring.  Multiple support tickets via website and direct email with no reply.  Look at all the 1 star reviews, they KNOW their drivers are stealing packages and do not care.

I had no contact up to that point to let me know the delivery was on the way. The first communication I received from them was that they weren’t able to deliver my parcel. Instead of leaving it in the lobby, they left with it. I submitted a re delivery request on 27 Oct. They emailed the sender on 28 Oct that my parcel delivery has been suspended?! I have been in line to speak to a customer service representative for 45 minutes. The first three calls were dropped without being answered. This is no way to run a delivery service company.

Date of experience: October 20, 2024KRKristen2 reviewsUSOct 30, 2024Worst parcel company everI ordered bras from shapermint. I see that on a Sunday uni uni tried to deliver but was unsuccessful. That's fair because I live inside an apartment building that's secure and leasing is only open from 1-5 and maybe they don't have access like some of the bigger carriers. I set up for another delivery as their site says they're to make 2 attempts. Nothing, they never tried again. I scheduled for a re delivery as they said maybe my address was wrong. It was not. Nothing happened for 2 days. I finally called and asked for the product to be re shipped and was told they'd update my order w a new tracking number. I just had another ticket placed that I had an issue but no resolve. Another 2 days I see my package was sitting at the warehouse. I call again and was told this would be escalated to their supervisor because I expressed my frustration. Within 24 hours the \"supervisor\" emailed me that they don't deliver to my area and contact the company I bought from to use another service. Meanwhile, the day before I saw two uni uni packages for another tenant in the mail room and I live in a big city, not a rural town,  for them to say that. They're horrible and liars. I'll deal w companies that don't use them and because of them Shapermint had to refund me but after more back and forth.

That's the reason they got two stars instead of one--and that means they did the bare minimum. If you want to use a bare minimum company, these folks are for you!I ordered an item online from someone other than Amazon--something I rarely do. Instead of delivering the package to my door (and dropping it behind a large pillar so it's not visible to package thieves), the lazy slug who delivered my item left it in plain view in front of my garage door. Fortunately, I was working from home and have security cameras that give me alerts, so I was able to retrieve the package almost immediately. How lazy are these drivers/delivery people? Too lazy to walk another 50 feet to ensure my package was out of sight at my doorstep? I'm writing the vendor (from which I'd planned to order other items) to tell them I will NOT order from them again if they are going to use UniUni to deliver. Amazon, FedEx and UPS have spoiled us. Even the USPS is a cut above these goofballs. Date of experience: September 27, 2024ALAlly1 reviewUSOct 16, 2024Delivered to wrong addressDelivered to wrong address.

They steal packages, lie about deliveries, and provide false information about delivery attempts. I’ve been forced to stop shopping at stores like SHEIN, Temu, and LuvMe Hair because they all use this unreliable courier to save a few bucks.Since July, I haven’t received any packages at my address, and after I complained, they claimed they no longer deliver to my location. This feels like retaliation, especially since they had previously accepted my packages for delivery. Their customer service is a complete joke and they don’t answer the phone. If you email them, they take days to reply. I’ve had to dispute charges for packages that were never received and have reported UniUni to the BBB and the state attorney general multiple times.Despite the overwhelming number of complaints, they still operate without accountability. I’ve documented every failed delivery and saved all customer service exchanges. It’s outrageous that they’re allowed to handle packages when they consistently fail to deliver. Avoid UniUni at all costs!Date of experience: October 16, 2024SSSS2 reviewsCAOct 5, 2024Absolute dog courier serviceAbsolute dog courier service.

They notified me it was delivered and I went out immediately to get it and surprise, it was not there. It was impossible to tell where it was delivered in their picture but it was not delivered to the address on the package. It will likely end up in a second refund. Now I will ask what delivery service is used BEFORE I purchase anything on eBay, or any where else.. If it is UniUni I will buy from a different seller or do without.Date of experience: October 07, 2024GRAHAM HANDSWORTH2 reviewsCAOct 27, 2024Delivery drivers who abuse customers…Delivery drivers who abuse customers animals.

The LAZY delivery guy rings the intercom enters the building and then proceeds to leave my package downstairs in the common area where hundreds of people leave and enters the building. He then takes a photo as if he delivered to my address.  I do NOT live downstairs!! I tried to call this company to complain nobody answered the phone. If i didn't have a surveillance camera to watch him as he left the package I am sure my package would've gone missing! Date of experience: July 11, 2024Gabriel Arrarás1 reviewUSOct 30, 2024UniUni Employs CriminalsI had an absolutely appalling experience with UniUni that I feel compelled to share. On October 24, 2024, one of their delivery drivers not only delivered our package but also stole my wife's phone right off our front porch! This happened while my wife was momentarily distracted, taking our two-month-old child out of the car and into the house.We immediately reached out to UniUni multiple times, desperately seeking their assistance in the active police investigation. The police were tracking the stolen phone via GPS and needed information about the driver to apprehend them. Shockingly, UniUni failed to provide any meaningful help or cooperation. Their complete lack of responsiveness and disregard for the seriousness of the situation is beyond unacceptable.It's deeply concerning that UniUni employs individuals who engage in criminal behavior and then refuses to take responsibility or assist in rectifying the situation. This raises serious questions about their hiring practices and whether they conduct proper background checks on their employees.I strongly advise anyone considering using UniUni's services to think twice. Their negligence and indifference have caused our family immense stress and violated our sense of security in our own home. Companies like this should not be in business if they can't ensure the safety and trustworthiness of their employees.Would give zero stars if possible.Date of experience: October 24, 2024Steph Donmoyer1 reviewUSOct 1, 2024My package was delivered to the wrong…My package was delivered to the wrong address, even the pic in tracking shows this.  It is impossible to reach anyone by phone.  I have tried multiple times and after 30 mins or so when it say I have a few minutes left to wait the call is disconnected.

THIEVES!Placed an order from Temu and they used this joke of a \"business\" UniUni for delivery services. Pictures showing delivery are no where near what my address even looks like, and good luck contacting tthem. I put in several requests online about missing parcel and no response, then called the number to be placed on hold to speak to an agent for 28 minutes and when it finally rang to connect me there was no one at the other end and then it hung up on me. So now I have no package and no response. Will be disputing charges and contacting Temu as this apparently is the norm from them. Neither company will get my business again.Date of experience: September 25, 2024Altavya Hannah1 reviewUSOct 11, 2024This is a scam serviceThis is a scam service. First of all who are you guys.

No wonder I never heard of them until now(!)Horrible company. I purchased some items from an online vendor, only to not receive the delivery when it was supposed to arrive. I start clicking thru the status links and land on a page for \"UniUni\". It says they returned the package to their warehouse undelivered because it had the \"wrong address\". I had no idea what \"UniUni\" was until I looked them up, and discovered they are the delivery equivalent of a labrador retriever designing nuclear weapons- wholly incompetent. I have attempted several inquiries thru their website, with each rejected as a website failure. I would rather the vendor add in the fee for delivery by the known providers UPS, FedEx, or USPS than save a few coins by using this scam of a \"delivery company\".

I think the driver simply doesn’t want to drive out to my house. Emails go unanswered, trouble tickets go unanswered, after waiting on hold for 40 minutes, the gentleman said would reschedule delivery and call me back within 48 hours. Been 4 days, no call back. Sellers simply refund without helping about getting your package. That doesn’t help when they don’t refund shipping cost, so UniUni gets paid for not doing anything. Zero customer service, clearly crap at moving parcels. Date of experience: August 14, 2024Khandigirl Sunshine1 reviewUSSep 11, 2024Terrible delivery service …I order from a company and the uniuni delivery left it outside of the main apartment building. Attempted to make contact with them several times without success. Order the same items a second time hoping for a better outcome,  but no. Uniuni put failed delivery attempt and unable to contact. This is interesting since I was home all day and there is an apartment callbox which was never used. Still attempting to talk to someone.

I put in one order with TEMU and they were split into 3 separate deliveries. The first two deliveries I received through USPS. My last order is coming through UniUni and I have to go through hoops and hurdles to receive my package. The first “attempt” was FALSIFIED! Nobody tried to deliver my package. I am an employee at USPS and I work at the front desk where all the other carriers come in to bring packages but I can’t seem to get my package from this carrier service. The Customer Service representative “claims” they are going to investigate the driver and that the driver is to CALL ME when they redeliver. So I wake up this morning.. (Sunday) to another “attempted” delivery. We are CLOSED ON SUNDAYS! And nobody contacted me. This is THE WORST DELIVERY SERVICE! And as a customer we should have the option on what carrier we want to deliver our packages. I would never in my life choose this company!

This company has made it a point to not deliver to US military bases. (And you are often not told uniuni will be the delivering company until it is too late.) Either they are hiring drivers that can't pass a basic very quick background check, or don't have valid ID or insurance. This is not a hard thing. They really really do not care at all about the troops as they have a policy about this that blames the victim who can't get their package and then the vender says it is a uniuni issue and around and around it goes. Do you want your company to look like they hate veterans or are shady AF, than by all means use UniUni. Date of experience: August 30, 2024MIMichelle3 reviewsUSUpdated Oct 31, 2024uniuni is not to be trustedmy package was marked as a missed delivery for “contact failed + inaccessible.” I was home, awake and no one called me nor did they come by my home as at the time, 724am I was drinking my morning coffee in my living room looking out the window as I usually do. I find it hard to believe the time elapsed between out for delivery and missed delivery, 15 min, is reflective of them trying to deliver at all. I called when I noticed this by the afternoon when I checked tracking as absolutely no contact or update had been made. Customer service ended up informing me it could take up to ten additional days for a second attempt as they need to investigate ME for fraud as people keep saying their packages are stolen when they are delivered, I ask how this is relevant to my issue as THEY marked they didn’t deliver and he kept repeating the line about fraud being the reason. I never got an actual answer who knows if ill get my package but I will be reaching out to the seller. update:despite scheduling a redelivery the same day as the missed delivery they went ahead and returned my package to sender, I will never buy from cider again due to this experience.

The driver threw my packages over my gate fence instead of putting in a clearly marked basket for delivery packages. This resulted in damage to one of the items and I couldn’t open my gate to enter my property as the packages were blocking the swing open gates.

They said they  tried to deliver my package at 10pm while the business was closed. They never left a notification of the attempted  delivery. Then  they  returned my package without any kind of notification. When I left a message on their  website  they  never  answered me back.

Date of experience: October 09, 2024ANAnna1 reviewUSUpdated Sep 25, 2024Kiss Your Packages GoodbyeSTAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY AND BLOCK THEM FOR DELIVERY IF POSSIBLE. I ordered some items on Temu, which usually has expedited delivery. It had been two weeks, so, I decided to check on the status of my package. UniUni claims that they tried to deliver, but my address was wrong. It's the same address I use for all of my orders. So, I called UniUni and after being placed on hold for a while, the rep informs me that they will attempt a second delivery in a few days. The alleged delivery day is tomorrow and today, I got a notification that my package will not be delivered because it's been returned to the Temu warehouse. I called again to ask about the situation and the rep gaslit me. He kept disagreeing me with by saying \"No, miss\" whenever I spoke. Rude employees and terrible delivery service.Date of experience: September 23, 2024Colin Chicoine1 reviewCAJul 29, 2024Incompetent employeesIncompetent employees. Incapable of speaking english or french. Extremely lazy deliveries, never done to the door, always left in the lobby.

I have submitted multiple support tickets and Uni Uni has not responded to neither of my support tickets and emails.Aliexpress has dismissed my claims due to lack of evidence in my case Uni Uni marked it as delivered and shared an image that is not even my package/address. This is truly frustrating as I shop with aliexpress often and have never had an issue with delivery. Now this makes me not want to order anything else if this is the parcel company they will be using. Very bad for business. Date of experience: August 29, 2024Vijay Laxmi1 reviewUSSep 25, 2024Never expect your package from them. Worst experience Hi folks,Honestly i didn’t have the option to give no star to them. Worst experience encountered with them. I ordered a package from commense and did not recieve any. Even after multiple follow ups, all they said was they would get back within 48hrs which was not true . I had to follow up on them every alternate days. They dont reply to emails and their call wait time takes forever. After almost 2 months of follow up , they tell me the parcel is returned to the seller. It’s frustrating and waste of time and money. If this continues no wonder the company will shut down.

Date of experience: October 28, 2024Read 1 more review about UniuniCHChuck1 reviewUSSep 16, 2024The delivery was messed up, and web site and customer support do not work.What went wrong?  First the driver says that the package wasn't delivered because of the weather, but it is sunny outside.  I think they were possibly under a time constraint and just didn't even try.  Second the web site does not accept the tracking number.  I have experience in web site design, and I think this web site is very bad in general, but that it just doesn't work is a kicker.When I came in to leave a complaint about the Company, I noticed 91% of the reviews are 1 star.  The same is true of experiences on Reddit.  Can I say I am not surprised.  In my opinion this is among the worst managed companies I can imagine.  If it had stock I would short it because it is a sure bet to fail.

What surprised me was how user-friendly the platform turned out to be. Adding and updating products was straightforward, and the inventory system practically runs itself. The mobile app is a real game-changer – I can manage my store right from my phone!One crucial lesson I learned: watch your spending carefully. Those small costs can add up quickly, but staying organized with expense tracking helped me stay on budget.I'd definitely recommend Shopify for anyone running a small or mid-sized business. The platform's simplicity is its biggest strength – you don't need to be tech-savvy to get started. Everything from product management to daily operations is designed to be straightforward, even for newcomers like me.Date of experience: October 31, 2024RORoberta 12 reviewsUSNov 4, 2024Stay away from ShopifyShopify is not a good platform to host your website. They recently changed their reporting for the merchant account and it is VERY difficult to reconcile your bank account with your sales and payouts. They also hold on to your money for close to a week where other merchant accounts payout the next day. Before this most recent change, there would be about 20-22 payouts per month from the merchant account side of Shopify. Now there are 46-50 payouts per month and sometimes the payouts do not match what went into your bank.Reach out to customer service and they only tell you this is the new way of doing things. If you don't want stress in your life, stay away from Shopify. Find another platform to host your website.Date of experience: November 04, 2024Read 1 more review about ShopifyAdvertisementA.E. Óbidos1 reviewPT2 days agoWarning About Shopify PaymentsSince July, Shopify has been holding 586,20€ of our nonprofit organization’s funds without resolution. Here’s the story:Allowed Use of Shopify Payments: Shopify allowed us to use Shopify Payments, which we did, receiving some payments.Document Request AFTER Payments: Only after we received payments did they request legal documents. It’s confusing (and concerning) that they enabled this feature before confirming eligibility.Incorrect Document Demands: They’re asking for an official commercial registration, but we’re a nonprofit in Portugal, where nonprofits don’t have commercial registrations. We provided all legally required documents, yet nothing has happened.Customer Support Nightmare: I’ve contacted Shopify Support repeatedly, and they are either unhelpful or just tell me “it’s with another team.” It’s been over 3 months, and still, Shopify is holding our funds with no solution in sight.If you’re considering Shopify, please think twice. Nonprofits, especially, beware—this has been a frustrating and unresolved experience. Our advice: steer clear if you value reliable support and transparency.Date of experience: November 11, 2024Dee Bailey1 reviewUS4 days agoIf I could put a 0 I wouldIf I could put a 0 I would. I have Shopify a shot. Decided the 30 day free trial was a good start. I even gave myself 60 days being new. I soon realized I had 3 stores and by sept was paying for all three. Never used two of them by the way. The whole process was so confusing. I finally figured out how to close all three stores which I did. Or so I thought. Once again this month was charged for 3 stores. At $39 a piece. The kicker is I have no way to even dispute the charges because the only way you can get support is through your store. Meaning I would have to reopen a store I apparently never closed, cuz I’m still charged for them. To even attempt to get this figured out. I’m so unbelievably angry right now.

I launched it and invested heavily in advertising. I received my first three orders, but the next day I was banned by Shopify. They sent me a form which I filled out. Now it’s been more than a week. The support chat agents keep telling me they’ll get back to me as soon as possible, even though their website states responses typically take 3 to 7 business days. It wouldn’t be so bad if they could actually help, but they can’t seem to. One of the support agents was even rude and abruptly ended the chat. So, in the end, I’ve spent £2,000 and two weeks — one of which has been just waiting and hearing endless promises from their supposedly excellent support.Date of experience: November 04, 2024PSPS1 reviewCANov 1, 2024Due to Shopify, I Can't proceed my businessFirst, Shopify terminated my account just after one day i started. I already bought domain name & linked to the store. Then, I was not able to fill dispute form. Not allow me to upload my ID's & signature.Then, I chat with support advisor & raised ticket to unlink my domain from that store. So, i can use my domain to new store.Now, its more than 15 days I am still waiting for their response on my ticket. every time support advisor says they are going to put a note for high priority.I am stuck right now, can't proceed my business.Pathetic customer service.Big thing, you cannot talk to any responsible team, you can only chat with regular advisors & they only have little access about your store.Date of experience: October 17, 2024CHCharity 3 reviewsHKNov 1, 2024 SCAM!  Time for me to start legal proceedings on this company.TOTAL SCAM!   I never receive items I place through this website.  It is a way for sellers to steal your money and never send you the purchased item.  Shopify never returns emails.  Zero customer service or guarantees. You might as well throw your money out the window.  They should be SHUT DOWN IMMEDIATELY!   Shopify is a well run scam operation and I am surprised it is still legal for them to operate.

Tell me why your dispute form has already decided my name and won't even allow me to input my last name. And The SUPPORT IS SOOOO LOUSY AND INFURIATING!

I tried setting up my shop on Shopify, but it felt overwhelming and expensive. Unlike platformslike Etsy, Shopify left me on my own to drive traffic and manage every aspect of marketing.Shopify is great for businesses that want control and customization, but for individual artisans or small creators, it can be a lot to manage. Artisans generally want to focus on making quality products, not spending hours on marketing, SEO, and paid ads just to get a few sales.I think Shopify should consider creating a marketplace specifically for handmade items and unique creations, similar to how Etsy was in its early days. Such a platform could provide the customization options of Shopify but also help sellers by bringing in a built-in audience interested in artisan goods. This way, creators could concentrate on their craft without feeling burdened by all the business logistics.If you’re a creator or artist looking for a marketplace with built-in visibility, be aware that Shopify might not offer the same support as Etsy used to. While Shopify gives you control, it demands a lot more in terms of time, effort, and money to get noticed. I hope Shopify considers this feedback and maybe develops a platform to truly support artisans in the future.Date of experience: November 05, 2024AdvertisementMMMike M20 reviewsUSOct 21, 2024A great company for sellers!While I agree with reviewers that they should bring back easier support contact methods, I do want to mention that their reviews do not reflect who they are and what they do for small business. If you are looking to start an ecommerce business, Shopify is hands down the best. I would need to write a book, not a review, to go over all the wonderful reasons why you should have a store with them. If they allow me to, they will be the backbone of my store forever.

The support they offer is, possibly, the worst I have ever engaged with. EVER. They use the \"Chat\" system, where one agent simultaneously fields 3 customers, and any issue that is related to a third party app, they refer you to that third party for the answer. My one simple little stoe, which relies on at least 4 add-on apps has been nearly impossoble to get support on....and all I'm trying to do is sell a t-shirtI have wasted HOURS UPON HOURS trying to get simple questions answered and, worse, It has kept me from getting my store up and running.

I have a Shopify Plus account which costs in the region of USD $3000 per month with all the added apps. Recently their 2-factor authentication stopped working, I literally just stopped receiving SMS's from them. Their support is so slow, even for Shopify Plus customers, and they are treating me as though I have done something to prevent the login from working. The hoops I have to jump through now to remove 2factor authentication are unbelievable. I am now in a position where I have not been able to log into my own store for 2 days and I am still waiting for support to reset my account. Shopify has become too big to offer efficient customer support, they are in an arrogant position where they know that it is super difficult to change to another provider, so they are unapologetic in their poor service.

If you are considering opening a Shopify store, you must speak fluent Chinglish. App. instructions, tutorials and general communications are all composed in a language that is confusing, misleading and in many cases inaccurate. In addition to the language barrier, you will have to navigate a plethora of \"steps\" in multiple apps. which use confusing terminology and leave you wondering, \"What does this mean?\" and \"What do I do now?\" To access customer support, you'll have to stand on your left foot, hold your right hand in the air, hop in a counterclockwise direction and chant the magic words... in chinglish, of course. Overall, navigating the Shopify website has been akin to attempting to decipher the, \"Instructions\" that came with the \"some assembly required\" Chinese dresser which my wife ordered for my daughter last Christmas.

Lazy, misinformed, ignorant staff - wait days for a reply which has nothing to do with your issue. Simple request to change one setting which the poor website build will not allow me to change. Staff are clueless. Charge you out the ar5e for doing pretty much nothing. They let fraud orders through - and if you don't have time to check every single order, you're getting chargebacks for dispatched orders. F you Shopify, you absolute helmets.

Discussed internally, realized that we do not need the software any longer after we updated our main shipping software. Reached out to Sifted saying we want to cancel the subscription. Appeared to get into a really bad argument on cancellation with the support team, that was eventually completely resolved, but did cause some nerves.With that, would recommend to track your renewal dats carefully.Returning to the software piece - as originally stated, works well and helps to save money.Date of experience: September 25, 2022Reply from SiftedMar 3, 2023Maryia,I am sorry for this experience.

They are attempting to be Uber for fulfillment but like Uber they have no control over their warehouses.  They are an unnecessary middleman that hurts small businesses by overcharging for a very poor, unreliable product.Date of experience: November 10, 2021Reply from FlowspaceNov 11, 2021Your feedback is very valuable to the Flowspace team.

A little quick, but as we are all professionals, it was a business-like, efficient affair, providing familiarity to the site.  We will see how flexible the site can be as we onboard our first client.

The Flowspace TeamSRSara Raffa1 reviewUSAug 5, 2020Happy new client!We just started working with Flowspace and so far so good! They worked with us to help achieve fair pricing based on our business and then quickly found us a warehouse. The transition team has been really helpful and responsive. It was always so difficult to get in touch with our old warehouse so I love that we have people available to help whenever it's needed. I also really like their platform. It easily syncs with shopify and you get live updates. It's super easy to change orders as needed and the system automatically picks the cheapest shipping method based on shipping speeds you select, so we're saving some money on shipping too.I can't speak to the longer term relationship but hopeful we'll be with them for a long time!Date of experience: August 05, 2020AMAmanda1 reviewUSApr 30, 2019InvitedThe Flowspace team is very helpfulThe Flowspace team is very helpful.  We've had some difficulties with tracking inventory at our booked warehouse, but everyone has been extremely quick to jump in and work with us to fix it. The turn around time for outbound orders is excellent!Date of experience: April 30, 2019ANAndrea1 reviewUSJan 11, 2019InvitedEasy tool!It's very easy to learn and use, I allows me to keep an eye on each order and know the status.To improve, I previously had some trouble with the inventory adjustments. I was only able to delete or add units in for a SKU but I couldn't choose the location. I just have received a Newsletter explaining that now is possible, but I haven't tried it yet.On the other hand, I would like to highlight the good customer service offered. Oscar and JR are always reachable, quick answers and oriented to solution.Good job :)Date of experience: January 11, 2019WEWes1 reviewUSDec 21, 2020Really poor customer serviceReally poor customer service. No dedicated company reps, no accountability. Takes days and weeks to hear back from flowspace reps on issues. This company started out great and has really gone down hill fast.Date of experience: December 21, 2020KHKhila10 reviewsUSJan 26, 2022do not use flowspaceUsing Flowspace to fulfillment my orders is the biggest mistake I’ve ever made for my business. Over the course of the 6 months I used them:- They swapped SKUs in the warehouse so customers were consistently receiving the wrong items they purchased. - They were choosing the most expensive shipping options instead of the specific option I specified I wanted used. - Decided to not ship orders to Canada without consulting me. - & Finally, started charging me $550 a month instead of $250 without letting me know. Literally increased my monthly fee by $300 and I had to find out from my bank. Flowspace’s logistics and customer service are such a headache that they are not worth $250, let alone $550. I immediately got all of my inventory out of there and have since switched to ShipBob.com which is 10x better for way less. Do yourself and your business a favor and steer clear of Flowspace.Date of experience: January 26, 2022Reply from FlowspaceJan 31, 2022Hi Khali, Flowspace thanks you for your feedback. During our partnership with The Bougie Brand, we did move two alike sku's to different locations in the warehouse to ensure picking accuracy.  Orders can be shipped to Canada with the harmonization code properly set up for shipping internationally.  We did take time with your assistant and showed her the proper steps to set up this code; when ready to execute Canada shipments.  We are very transparent with our merchants and did send communications regarding increasing our platform fees.  We did offer you an extension to April, to pay the updated platform fees. We take pride in our partnerships and overall accept your final decision regarding your operations needs. Regards,Flowspace TeamAAAlex Astacio1 reviewDOSep 14, 2022Glad to have her on the team!Kamilah is always super helpful, kind, and very detail oriented.

Delivery was prompt, however of the two boxes this item was sent in only one was delivered to the door intact. The other portion was unboxed in the truck and handed to me at the door. Unfortunately they were gone by the time I realized they drove away with the box that held all of the hardware and instructions to put it together! Called Ryder office immediately and they punted me off to Pottery Barn rather than bring back what they took. Two weeks later I’m STILL waiting for said hardware because PB had to order it from an overseas vendor. I don’t fault PB because they’re great about taping hardware to inside box with a red ribbon attached so it can’t be missed. Ryder, however, couldn’t be bothered to bring back the box with the hardware they took!Date of experience: March 03, 2023AdvertisementDKDarta Kurotsuchi1 reviewUSOct 2, 2019Driver cut me off and ran a red lightDriver cut me off and ran a red light.

An automated message gives me prompts to direct my call. The prompts do not have a compalints or cx. Service line. After hitting a number to get to a rep a new automated message tells me the office is closed and hangs up on me. After googling the branch I was transfered to, I find out that that branch doesn't close for another hour after my call.

They consistently struggle to find my address or falsely claim to have attempted delivery when no one was available. I work from home with my office facing the street, so I know for a fact they never showed up. Somehow, they're so stealthy that even my Ring camera fails to capture their \"attempted\" deliveries. Dealing with them has been nothing but frustrating.Date of experience: October 22, 2024Bob Lite2 reviewsUSOct 23, 2024Nordstrom sent my $700 coat through…Nordstrom sent my $700 coat through Laser Ship and its gone missing. Laser ship said it was delivered yesterday and, like a door dasher, took a pic of a doorstep. Not mine  Nor that of any of the 200 houses on my street. Who knows, they could place it on any door step, take a pic, then grab the package and leave with it. Laser shippers could always use a new coat, especially a free one from Nordstrom. Unlike FedEx, there's no recourse or tracking. Im stuck fighting for my money back.Date of experience: October 22, 2024CACammy1 reviewUSOct 24, 2024If I could give less than one star I…If I could give less than one star I would.

The station they pick up from near me is in Mineola, about an hour away from me. The package is on their \"vehicle\" at 10:30 in the morning I don't get it until 9PM at night in the dark. I might as well have been told that its coming the next day because its useless to me to get my packages that late. Horrible delivery service that has, in the past thrown my packages or left them in my driveway etc. Why retailers use them is beyond me. They are not faster and could care less about customer service. I have requested retailers that I purchase from not to use them.Date of experience: October 10, 2024NSNE shopper6 reviewsUSOct 18, 2024Lasership stinksLasership drivers are either lazy or can't read.

The thing is that the doors are kept open during the day and I went to see if it was locked, broken or something.  So tried calling. There is absolutely no one to speak too.

Not only did LaserShip fail to deliver my package, the customer service number listed for the package was non-working, the website \"chatbot\" was unable to direct me to an actual person.  When I finally tracked down an email address and sent a message, I had to wait three days for a reply only to be told my package would be held at a facility whose hours were 6:00 am to 2:00 pm at an address that was not verifiable.  I can only assume that my package has been \"returned\" to the sender (at this point I've gotten a refund) or trashed.  How is this company still in business???Date of experience: August 12, 2024Marie Goyaa1 reviewUSJun 8, 2024Worst shipping company ever!I do not understand why Walmart would use this shipping service. Both times this company has delivered my packages in less than a week. The driver left our packages out by the road in the middle of our driveway. Thankful no one pulled in and crushed it and my daughter found the packages before they could be stolen.

I ever asked Walmart how can I avoid sellers who use Lasership. I have no issues with other couriers such as UPS and FedEx. They leave parcels where they should.

How does any company use them knowing they are this bad?Update: I called and actually talked to a local supervisor. When I pressed them on why they needed me to call them for every shipment to provide more information than a valid address, they hung up on me.

That's OK - after a dozen deliveries, you expect the worst from LaserShip. What always kills me is \"an attempt was made to deliver at X:XXPM\" when I am sitting on the front porch waiting.  Uhmm - wait let me check the security tapes (maybe I fell asleep while waiting!).  NOPE - nothing over a two hour period.

The delivery guy rang the doorbell 18 times between 10:27pm-10:30pm (the SimpliSafe doorbell kept count). My husband and I were both asleep already, as he has to get up early for work and I'm 38 weeks pregnant and need as much sleep as I can get.

Lasership has never delivered a package of mine. They send notifications about my packages being delivered and also signed by me, which is not true. This leads me to losing money, time, and important items. I don't understand how Amazon is still working with this unreliable company. I tried to figure out a way to know if they are handing my packages prior to making a purchase on Amazon, but you can't know. Which is just stupid. How can I continue to make purchases online if LaserShip is going to be handling them.Date of experience: January 16, 2023SOSabrina Oliver3 reviewsUSApr 21, 2023Nasty and lazy driver..I just had a nasty lazy driver who just delivered my package 4/21/23 just got out of his van and toss my damn package across my backyard in the dirt which my bag split opened instead of coming to the door I caught it on my camera he seen the cars here and of course i said something to him as he looked stupid couldn't say nothing just lazy...Date of experience: April 21, 2023Rich Dabadoo1 reviewUSSep 8, 2023Lost foreverFirst, any company that uses the, will NEVER have my business.

Laser ship always says the order delivery date is the one originally promised... even 10 days after the fact.   Summit had to overnight large heavy items that Lasership lost.  I pulled all my business until they set my account t to UPS only.   I didn't know Babylist used these fools too... or I would have never purchased from them.

You send delivery people that don't speak English and you have to wait all day to get your package especially when you live in a building complex and people steal your packages if left outside your door. Customer service is the worst they can't even give you an estimate time. This business needs to go out of business frfrDate of experience: May 03, 2023ANAndy2 reviewsUSJan 3, 2023Worst delivery company in existence!LaserShip is horrible!  I had two separate orders from Under Armour ship using LaserShip, and neither one arrived. The packages made it to the the local LaserShip facility in Nashville, TN, and then were listed as “delayed” for several days. They then said they were delivered, but no packages were ever delivered. I am now having to go through Under Armour to get it reshipped or refunded.  Based on the similar reviews from other customers, LS is either completely incompetent, or they are nothing more than an organized scheme for package theft.  I’m not sure why anyone would use this company to delver their packages.  Too bad you can’t give negative ratings on Trustpilot.Date of experience: December 15, 2022EFEmilee Foster2 reviewsUSAug 3, 2023Constant IssuesThe first order I placed with the seller using Lasership was lost entirely, even though the tracking stated it was delivered. I tried contacting Lasership’s customer service but they didn't help at all. For all my recent orders, Lasership repeatedly delivers my packages to the wrong buildings in my complex, and it takes us time walk around and locate them.This is by far the worst shipping company I’ve ever encountered. Due to their issues, I can no longer patronize the online store that uses them, as I cannot trust that my orders will be delivered correctly.Date of experience: August 02, 2023EDEdward2 reviewsUSSep 10, 2023Worst Delivery ServiceWish I could Select 0 stars. Two straight days they sent me this totally untrue excuse - The driver attempted delivery but did not leave the package because of a security concern or signature requirement. I live in a building where the doormen are authorized to accept packages 24 hours a day. We will reattempt delivery.

The package was marked as delivered (left at front door), but I didn't receive it.  Proactiv then sent out a replacement.  Prior to this delivery, I went to the LaserShip website to add delivery instructions, including NOT to leave it at the front door.

Again today as with most deliveries the driver pulled as close to the garage door then proceeded to throw the package out the drivers door up to the garage door about twenty feet.  This is sad that they employ people to lazy to get out of their car and deliver the package to the front door or at least place it with care next to the garage door since they do not know what’s in the package they are delivering.Date of experience: October 07, 2023RPRichard P1 reviewUSDec 29, 2022Bad experience…I read several of the reviews other have made, and I agree with every one star rating.

Marley Spoon uses lasership for their subscription boxes--I have ordered food 8 times and only once was the box actually delivered to my address. Every other time it's been taken to a house a street over from mine, so I have to go search for it. I've added notes, I've reached out to Lasership (who said they'd tell the carrier) but nothing. Their customer service is also very unresponsive. I always get a standard \"we'll respond to your email within 2 days\", and maybe once they actually did respond. I would pay money for Marley Spoon to NOT use this service.Date of experience: January 21, 2023AEAmelia E1 reviewUSJan 7, 2023Worst shipperWorst shipper. Can’t believe the companies that are choosing to get in bed with this totally inept company. Purchases from Lulu and Aveda never made to our home. They were delivered to a home with the same address number, but a completely different street. We could see the house pic in tracking and it definitely wasn’t hours. Lots of back and forth with LaserShip and Aveda never got anywhere. Lulu acknowledged and gave credit right away. Surprisingly, had to go through my credit card company to set the Aveda purchase right. Now we spend extra to up the likelihood it’ll be fedex or ups. Sad we’d have to do that.Date of experience: November 01, 2022LALasha1 reviewUSJun 11, 2023Unfortunately can’t give them a 0 starUnfortunately can’t give them a 0 star.

My package was a gift for my mom. Went a week without tracking updates and when I contacted customer service, I was told by two different reps two completely different stories. One said the package was delivered, one said it was lost. The public tracking URL had the packaged marked as delivered. I never received it. Lasership is not a good company and I wish vendors would stop using them. As consumers we have no choice in what shipper is picked but if I had known Lasership was being used, I wouldn't have purchased from the vendor.Date of experience: December 29, 2022HFHeather Flynn5 reviewsUSJan 24, 2023I was supposed to receive my package on…I was supposed to receive my package on January 23rd 2023. During that day I got a text saying that it couldn't be delivered. I followed up to find out why and discovered that the driver lied and said that there is a gate and he/she didn't have the access code. We have no gate or code to get into our property. My package was right outside my door and could've easily been left outside my garage but now I have to wait up to two more days. We leave for vacation on Friday and I don't want packages laying around my property. The company lasership is inept and their drivers are liars.Date of experience: January 23, 2023LALarisa4 reviewsUSSep 7, 2023Walmart sent my order with this…Walmart sent my order with this company, they claim delivery attempted but they were unable to deliver my package to Harpers Ferry WV, so they took it back to Chantilly VA.

Constantly changing the delivery date, and it is just ridiculous that nobody can't figure out where the package is. Communication is off, and overall, this company sucks because they take their time in delivering items in a friendly manner, and then they try to deliver packages on Sunday, knowing that one base post service is closed on Sundays.

Ridiculous that Ontrac has zero accountability.Date of experience: November 02, 2024Nancy Ayles1 reviewUSNov 4, 2024I would give it zero Stars if I couldI would give it zero Stars if I could. Multiple packages were not delivered. The same as everyone else, I get the text message saying they need more information, I try to answer through that text but you get a bot who doesn't understand anything you say. They try to deliver, or so they say, three times and then you don't get your package. They claim the address is undeliverable. It's funny because all the other companies that don't use them delivered just fine. Then they had the nerve to take a picture that was blank to prove that they delivered something. I'm pretty sure from Reading other reviews that this company is using people who steal the packages and don't deliver them. We need to stop purchasing from any company who uses them unless they agree to not use them as a delivery agent.Date of experience: November 04, 2024AdvertisementKRKris2 reviewsUSNov 1, 2024Ridiculous companyRidiculous company.

One quarter of the package was caved in (luckily the products inside were ok.)  Today I notified the company I had ordered from that I would (sadly) no longer do business with them wholly due to their use of OnTrac.  Unfortunately we can't see which delivery company is used before we order from companies but this is my only recourse left.  I have had multiple occasions of them leaving packages out on my steps (I have a covered porch two steps further ..... ) even when it is raining.  They must get paid by how few steps they take.

Ive had problems w packages ordered from REI and Bath Body Works that were “undeliverable”. Tracking asked me to reach out to OnTrac to confirm shipping address but there is no way to reach this company. I had to call customer service at the store.

All the packages I've ever received from them never have tracking information correct (if they give it at all) the packages are late, with box mangled and not placed on the porch so in sight of neighbors and at the mercy of the weather elements. I have no idea why stores (especially Nordstrom) ever use them.

They deliver to the wrong place and robotically respond to call the police if they think the package was stolen. When informed delivery was never made they will only respond stating it is no longer their problem as it was marked delivered on their system.No company should be using OnTrac in 2024.

On 10/17/24 at 8:30 pm, the delivery driver hit my car parked in the front of my house and kept going. My Ring got her on camera throwing the package on my stairs, taking her picture and walking away - hit and skip. She knew she hit my car and had to feel the impact. I spent hours on their website trying to get some assistance. I got nothing but dumb auto responses. The phone number I finally got, no one answers or they're self-service - press 1, 2, etc. The answers are standard comments - absolutely no help whatsoever. I may have to pay my $500 deductible because of OnTrac's terrible driver if the police can’t locate her.

We were home, have no neighbors and a driveway alarm.  It never came.  Ontrac site showed undeliverable.  Thankfully I took a screen shot of that as \"undelieverable\" would disappear from their site.  They \"opened investigation\" and immediately said it was delivered-bye.  Product company now dragging feet, still no refund, a month later.  Now have to contest on credit card. Now paying attention to what delivery companies, companies are using, and will avoid OnTrac.  The purchase was an $80 power bank directly from Anker.  I have never seen such low ratings for a company (Ontrac.com) still doing business-unbelievable!

They absolutely have my correct address and I receive weekly deliveries from all other shipping companies to my front door.

After addressing this with them and the original seller they tried to mark the package as delivered at 11:30PM about a week after admiting it was \"lost\" aka stolen by one of their employees.  I have cameras and confirmed they never attempted a delivery, their local centers have several hundreds to thousands of reviews with the same issue. As best I can surmise they are running a ring of stealing packages and then reselling anything they can for additional profit. They are owned by lasership a now defunct business that went under for doing the exact same thing and resulted in jail time for some managers. It is clear they just rebranded and have continued their scam and theft ring of a business now as ontrac.Date of experience: October 21, 2024COCorbyn3 reviewsUSOct 7, 2024Total joke of a companyTotal joke of a company. No way to submit feedback, customer support agents/drivers don't care about you and are extremely unhelpful/annoyed when you reach out to them.

When I finally messaged an agent to escalate my request for a manager I was told it would take another 24hrs for a call back.

Trash! They don’t even deserve 1 star. I had a package expedited for 2 day shipping. On the day it was supposed to be delivered, the tracking listed “unable to locate”. I emailed them and got a vague answer.. 4 days after it was supposed to be delivered, it was finally delivered BUT it was in my front yard. I know it wasn’t put on my front porch due to my cameras not going off. Trash, trash, trash! I never want to deal with them ever again. Date of experience: November 12, 2024AdvertisementEllen Leal1 reviewUS6 days agoThey deserve 0 starsThey deserve 0 stars. The carrier that loses the packages or delivery the package opened with merchandise missing. 🤡Date of experience: November 07, 2024Rebecca Flynn2 reviewsUSNov 1, 2024This company is a JOKETrash! A local number text me Oct 29 and said “hey, I’ve got a package to deliver to you. Are you gonna be home?” I never thought that would have been a company. I text back and asked who it was. I never got a response. However, later that day, I saw an email and realized that my order of vape devices now require a signature from someone 21 and older. I put two into together and realize this was my order for the vapes. So I  go to look at tracking, the package is marked no one’s available. There was never a knock at my door or anything picked up on my ring camera. I text the number back. Sent two emails, now Nov 1, still no response. Thank you to the other review that gave a phone number. I’m going to try that now. I will update this review if it gets any better, but I’m not hopeful at all. This experience has made me 100% certain I will never order from a business again that uses this delivery service. I can only hope that in won’t take long before the companies they are contracted begin to realize they’re receiving a lot of complaints, dissatisfied customers & losing sales due to this delivery company.Date of experience: October 30, 2024L“Lynn “Gigi” Freeman13 reviewsUSSep 29, 2024Are they stealing packages?My package showed delivered to front door!

My porch is elevated so he didn't have that far to go.  I heard the package hitting my front porch all the way in my bedroom! Just pathetic. Date of experience: September 25, 2024AdvertisementJohn Ott1 reviewUSJun 12, 2024Company Is TrashHow can you show a package delivered at 12:24PM when it is only 12:10PM. Reached out to company and their internal investigation showed it was delivered at 12:24 PM. Email was sent to me at 12:23P from ticket #263673 opened at 12:15PM . Company is trash and apparently condone their employees stealing packages.Date of experience: June 12, 2024Kirby Franzese2 reviewsUSJun 12, 2024TerribleTerrible! Truly the worst delivery service I’ve seen, I have a package clearly lost in transit and they keep brushing me off and won’t really help me find it. Then the customer service agent made up some bizarre story that the delivery person is injured so my package will take an extra week to get delivered, I guess they have one driver?! lol. My package is still lost and I gave up talking to them after the weird story they made up.  Date of experience: June 12, 2024Katherine Davis1 reviewUSAug 28, 2024Trash logistics companyThey took over delivery of my HelloFresh meals a few weeks ago.  I’ve been doing HelloFresh for five years and never had a problem with delivery. I’ve had nothing but problems with them. They deliver late. It’s a business address. The door is locked. The door has hours 8 to 5 and they left it after hours on the door of a business. Of course it got stolen.  I have been in contact with them each week once noon hits and I don’t have the package like I normally do to tell them it has to be delivered before 5 pm, once they managed to call and said will be there by five every other time it’s a crapshoot and it either gets delivered the next day or it doesn’t get delivered on time and it gets delivered after hours to a locked business and stolen.  This is a trash, logistics company. Date of experience: August 26, 2024ANAnne1 reviewUSMay 31, 2023Poor customer service and delivery serviceThey deserve a zero for real. They drop people’s goods anywhere and expect us to find it all around the street. Close the company if you cannot deliver people’s good in perfect condition and in the right place, you can read, read the addressee contact and deliver appropriately, don’t ask us to look for our packages every like we didn’t give you instructions on where to deliver to. Makes zero sense of how you guys handle people’s packages. Shein and any other online clothing company needs to stop using you guys like wth.Date of experience: May 29, 2023AdvertisementJVJV1 reviewUSJun 11, 2023Wish I could give 0 stars!! AVOID!!!Wish I could give 0 stars!!! Can’t believe Zara would use this “shipping company”. My order has said delivered since June 01 but has not been received. LSO phone numbers do not work so no sense in even trying to contact customer service. Zara reps have started an investigation into the whereabouts of my order, but I could not rate this shipping company low enough. AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!Date of experience: June 10, 2023KIKim1 reviewUSAug 12, 2023Every time I am supposed to receive a…Every time I am supposed to receive a package from Nordstrom or fabfitfun and LSO is the carrier, the same thing happens: it’s immediately marked return to sender without ever leaving their facility. I suspect they just don’t want to deliver to our house, which is in a more rural area. It happened twice just this week, 4 times in the past three months.Date of experience: August 11, 2023TYTaylor Young5 reviewsUSApr 3, 2024LSO is uselessLSO is useless. They never even attempted delivery and claimed its a \"bad address\". As you can see this is a common theme for them from the other reviews. I have never had this issue with other delivery services and trying to get assistance from them is like pulling teeth. They don't have a working phone number and frankly don't want to help you. We will cancel any future orders that uses LSO and will be letting our friends and family know about this scam of a company. Date of experience: April 02, 2024KAKathryn3*7 reviewsUSJul 29, 2023They take FOREVER!!They take FOREVER!!! Ground shipping they claim to take 1-3 business days but everything ever shipped via LSO literally takes 2 weeks to get to me! I don’t know why Nordstrom uses them, it said my package was expected delivery on 7/26 and on 7/26 it was shown as in my city but still has not been delivered…no tracking updates and I actually think USPS is better than LSO! I can’t believe I’m saying that….Date of experience: July 29, 2023AdvertisementSHShine1 reviewUSMay 20, 2023PissedI had two packages waiting to be delivered from Fashion Nova. Both had the same delivery dates. Only one package arrived. The other order keeps getting switched from “it’s on its way!” To “local delivery delay”, to “exception” There used to be a delivery date, now the delivery date is blank.  You can’t speak to anyone. Never order from Fashion Nova If you need your merchandise in a timely manner. At this point I’m just going to request a refund.Date of experience: May 19, 2023GIGina1 reviewUSNov 10, 2023No response on lost shipmentThis carrier is losing shipments and responding to emails through their portal. You cannot speak with a person, all you get is an automated recording. My shipment has been unable to access and still hasn't changed and there has been no response. I also left a 1-star review for Fashion Nova for using them.Date of experience: November 08, 2023Janna Doughty1 reviewUSJun 6, 2023They deserve zero starsLike everyone else, they should be a ZERO! My package has been “out for delivery” since May 27th (it’s now June 5th) this company is an absolute joke and I cannot believe FabFitFun would use them let alone anyone else.  I heard from another customer in my area that they will literally leave packages on sidewalks and roll up in a freaking Camry. If you package ends up with LSO you can expect it to be delayed or lost. And good luck getting customer service to respond.Date of experience: June 05, 2023Pat Paulsen1 reviewUSJul 27, 2023LSO Has No Customer ServiceLSO has no customer service. I tried contacting them about a missing shipment, but they do not respond to emails, and if you try calling them you get a message saying that they are, \"Unable to answer calls\". It's a joke!

Even without any dents in the box. I had read all the negative reviews and was worried since my package had not gotten to me yet. But, all was good.

These people delivered my package to the wrong apartment then stole it! They didn’t know the neighbors across the hall had a camera in the window and caught everything. LSO count your days.

Date of experience: March 21, 2024AdvertisementAmber Baise1 reviewUSJan 3, 2024The ABSOLUTE WORST…Please refrain from ordering anything online if they are using this company to ship with. This is the most incompetent and laziest shipping company I’ve ever experienced. Not to mention they lie a lot and steal packages. I made sure I stayed home three days straight to make sure that I was here when my package arrived because it was constantly saying “unable to access”. After the three days, the status updated twice, saying the same thing when no one had ever even attempted to deliver my package. This company alone makes me not want to order online simply because I don’t know if they are being used to ship packages or not.Date of experience: January 02, 2024CICindy 3 reviewsUSAug 10, 2023Negative zero would be an accurate…Negative zero would be an accurate rating for this company.  They are absolutely the worst delivery service. I don’t understand why Nordstrom continues to use them.  LSO lied about delivering my package, stating the building was closed.  The concierge in my building is available until 10pm every day. You can’t call them , all you get is “unable to take your call” message.  Oh and don’t try to email, you’ll get no response.  There’s no update on the website to track your package. I don’t understand how they are still in business.Date of experience: August 03, 2023Maksym Pozomin1 reviewUSMar 25, 2024Shein order. They don't know how to deliver thingsOrdered something from Shein, they shipped the package using this LSO company. They misdelivered my package and when I contacted them they basically did nothing. The driver delivered the package to a maintenance room in the apartment complex instead of delivering to my apartment. Some of you may think, maybe I didn't specify the apartment number, but I did! If you can't find the right apartment, drop it off to the front office, but not to a maintenance door. They didn't apologize or offer any solution. All they did after I told them about the missing package was wishing me a good day and advising to contact the seller. The worst people ever.

Do not use them.Date of experience: April 17, 2023AdvertisementGOGob1 reviewUSOct 16, 2023The worstI don't believe any consumers actually want to use this company. They lose (or I suspect steal) packages regularly and if by chance they actually deliver your package don't be surprised if it's to the wrong location or shows up damaged. I honestly think they have a bunch of thieves and incompetent employees. Complain to whoever you buy stuff from to stop using this service. It worked for me (REI quit using them eventually, I assume after so many complaints). Never had these repeated issues with other couriers.Date of experience: September 21, 2023SBSamantha Bennett2 reviewsUSAug 9, 2023Worst Shipping CompanyAnytime I order from Target and see that the shipping is through LSO, I know I'm screwed. This time the package took an entire extra week to be delivered. There was never up to date or accurate tracking detail. When it finally was delivered without notice, a random personal SUV with local plates pulled into my drive way, parked, and then the person delivering the packed took her sweet time getting it out of the back while talking on the phone and putting it in front of my door where I can't get to it without pushing it out of the way. This company is trash and should not be allowed to exist.Date of experience: August 09, 2023LILiz1 reviewUSJul 26, 2023LSO company is literally horribleLSO company is literally horrible. 7/25/23 they literally delivery me an empty box .

They literally need to get shut downDate of experience: July 25, 2023LDLauren D1 reviewUSJun 17, 20243 packages in a row “delivered”This is the third time that this company has “delivered” a package to my apartment. Each time the package was not placed into a locker, resulting in theft. Per my apartment management, there are clear instructions to deliver packages to the locker. Somehow, all 3 deliveries were placed on the ground and were missing by the time I went to retrieve the package just a few hours later. I feel like the diver is not placing the package in the locker on purpose so that they can steal it. Every time I reached out to the company, they claim it was “delivered correctly” despite the package being wedged into the corner of the package room floor. I also find it ironic that the corner of choice is the only dead zone for the cameras.  This company is terrible, and their customer service is even worse.

I've never seen a worse logistics carrier. Based on their tracking tool, my package leaves from Dallas, TX en route to Olathe, KS (20 minutes from Kansas City). However, when it gets to Kansas City they often route the package back to Dallas. Once the package made it to the hub in Olathe, where I live....instead of delivering the package to my home...they sent back to Dallas.

Fast forward to tuesday supposedly they found it and delivered it at 2:58 PM.When I went to look at 3:20 PM.It wasn't there.My dog didn't make any noise which means nobody came.They just put delivered at front door. So either they delivered it to the wrong property.Or never delivered. Now I have to fight for a refund.Get the part reordered and wait additional time for that car part, Don't order with anyone that uses this delivery company, As stated in ninety five percent of the reviews.Date of experience: May 14, 2024AdvertisementCarmen Major1 reviewUSJul 20, 2023Terrible ServiceTerrible If I could give 0 stars, I would.  They have the worst service, and they don't have any customer support.  A package from San Antonio to Fredericksburg Texas has been in transit for over a week.  So much for overnight delivery.  It cost $40 and the package still isn't there. Important payments that need to be overnight bouncing between here and Dallas.  Worst ever.Date of experience: July 20, 2023Stephanie Thomas1 reviewUSUpdated May 10, 2023LSO is definitely a joke!!!!LSO is definitely a joke!!!!! They definitely are lying trash!! Geesh was waiting on package from SHEIN was sitting for 5 days in my city and when I pressed for rush it all of a sudden said delivered but I didn’t receive  jack, nothing was delivered maybe we all should rally and go to the news so that they can get answers cause you damn sure can’t reach anybody, the only parcel service you can reach.Date of experience: May 08, 2023ENElizabeth Nguyen1 reviewUSMay 30, 2023this is why ups and usps is better…so recently on may 16th, i ordered some phone cases, ipad cases, and airpod cases from shein as a gift for my parents and brother. it should’ve been delivered by may 28th (i live in arlington), but guess what? on the tracking by “LSO” it has been left as “in transit” in fort worth & dallas ever since may 27th. i still haven’t received my shein package today either. i usually have no problems receiving my packages from shein when the delivery companies were ups and usps so i don’t know why it suddenly switched to LSO. plus, ISO customer service barely does anything, i sent an email at around 10am but now by 3pm still nothing from them. then after contacting shein about this, i’ll now have to wait 5-7 days for shein to investigate on this matter.Date of experience: May 28, 2023ZEZee2 reviewsUSMay 14, 2023LSO overnight is reporting items as delivered but is not delivering them…I ordered some items from Nordstrom rack considering of 3 diff things. Two of the items were delivered via UPS and I received the timely. The 3rd item was supposed to be delivered by this company in which I never received, after reaching out and complaining it eventually showed up as delivered right after it arrived to shipping site in Fort worth. I never received these items and had to request a refund. Now another company I've ordered from recently,uses this shipping company as well and the same thing is slowly happening. My items have been in transit for much longer than usual.Date of experience: May 12, 2023AdvertisementRachel Kilgore1 reviewUSJun 1, 2023This service is a jokeThis service is a joke. I got a tracking number over two weeks ago. It had zero updates until today when it said “out for delivery” but it’s 11 o’clock and night and no delivery. I don’t even know who is going to deliver it. USPS? FedEx? Some guy in a white van just tossing it on my porch? Business should not use them if they care about their customers and customers should not rely on anything that is communicated to them because it’s all meaningless. Really hope I get my package!!Date of experience: May 31, 2023KUKustomer1 reviewUSJun 29, 2023More awful experiences with LSO. Companies should NEVER work with them again!I ordered a very expensive purse from Macy's and LSO tried to \"deliver\" it to my house yesterday, marked it as \"undeliverable\" and returning it back to Macy's today. Like... what??? Amazon, Fedex, DHL, USPS, Wal-Mart and Target always deliver packages to my house easily with no issues. LSO is the WORST, they have also lost a few of my other packages with other companies. I got in touch with a rep at Macy's and told them to stop working with LSO. Worst shipping company and they are SCAMMERS!!!!Date of experience: June 29, 2023Kheanna Landrum1 reviewUSMay 17, 2023Something seems fishySomething seems fishy! I got an email saying that my delivery was attempted around 10pm and that my package was “Inbound scanned at destination” at 3:51AM!” Not to mention I can’t get a hold of anyone. The customer service number doesn’t work and the directions on scheduling a pick up are outdated.Date of experience: May 17, 2023Leslie Allen1 reviewUSJul 14, 2023LSO either steals packages or delivers…LSO either steals packages or delivers to the wrong address.  For me, this is the 3rd package that was supposedly been delivered that I have not received. It’s not hard! My address is a giant apartment building with a front office that is open during business hours. If you can’t locate my apartment number, leave it at the office during business hours or in the mail room where we have secure package lockers. But, that would be if LSO was really trying to deliver.  I think y’all are just stealing packages and you should be prosecuted.Date of experience: July 10, 2023AdvertisementDBDavid Brown2 reviewsUSMar 6, 2024AbsurdThis is a flawed company. The only thing worse than their customer service is the actual service they're supposed to provide. Upon tracking my package I discovered I was a closed business with no access. I am a residence with wide open access. It took 4 days of constant emails for them to update tracking to out for delivery. They failed to show once again. I offered many times to pick up package if they would give me a location to do so. No response to this no response to where package was no response to my concerns. How this company stays in business with such practices is beyond my comprehension. I rate them a one only because it's the lowest available review they are not worth one star.

This company is an absolute fraud. I have never had a bad experience shopping on SHEIN until they partnered with LSO.Tracking showed they couldn’t locate my address, reached out to them to provide my contact info and gate access. I was shocked and still in shock to be told item has been delivered earlier.Where is the proof and why is there no notification on delivery like other vendors do?Avoid them for you own good.Date of experience: November 27, 2023Lon Lon1 reviewUSMar 7, 2024ZERO STARS!!!ZERO STARS!!!This company is full of it, they left my package OUTSIDE UNSECURED at the mailstation in my apartment complex, not inside the mailbox literally OUTSIDE sitting on the ground and it was stolen and then they had the audacity to say it was delivered to the correct address to the mailroom.

I said, so what you're saying is that you nothing shipped with your company has any guarantee of actually making it to it's intended recipient? She said \"Yes, we never guarantee, so maybe you'll get it today or maybe not. If its perishable, you'll have to deal with the company you bought it from, as we don't handle any complaints for packages we decide not to deliver.\"It seems a lot of these companies are using these gig based delivery companies and they people that do the deliveries just don't give a damn.I would suggest that you ask ANY company that you buy products from and ask if they use this company for deliveries.

After the first 2 trouble tickets they sent me pictures of the product delivered to the wrong address and continuously assured me that 1- They had done their part 2- I was at fault and 3- To refer to the picture of the delivered product. I had to send several emails all with brand new customer support tickets (as I was instructed to do at the end of each email along with being told I had received my product). Even after calling and being promised they would get back to me, it’s been a week since the call and nothing. The craziest part is that they have delivered to my house from the same site on 3 separate occasions this year alone. The address is saved on the site, and if they take pictures of deliveries, then they could easily just look at the home in the 3 other deliveries and see they messed up. Their customer service is horrible.  I’d much rather have my packages delivered by USPS. At least they know how to properly follow a gps.Date of experience: June 11, 2024JDJoseph Diggs3 reviewsUSMay 10, 2024Nonexistent customer service and theftNonexistent customer service and zero accountability. Rampant theft. I have had many deliveries from StockX. Never an issue or delay, when UPS or FedEx was the company tasked with delivery after authentication. However, whenever packages are delivered by this company, my shoes never arrive or become “lost” during shipment from their facility. The company's use of “independent” contractors seem to have contributed to the theft of packages. The management offer no accountability, apology, or remedy for the issue. You can literally see a timetable of when your package was stolen. The company is either complicit in the thefts or don't care about the issue. It has been two weeks and no one from management has contacted me concerning the incident.Date of experience: April 15, 2024MRMaria Rivera5 reviewsUSUpdated Nov 2, 2021Delivered to wrong address twice!Purchased an item from Zulilly.

Customer service keeps saying they have submitted the complaint to higher but haven't heard back from them. It's been 11 days since the product was delivered to the wrong location, and they told me to wait another 24 hours to see if they hear back from higher ups.

After seeing my package was out for delivery, I expected it within the day, but came to find it was marked as undeliverable due to denied access.  This was obviously a lie as the same day TFORCE claimed to be attempting delivery, I also received a delivery from Amazon.  The Amazon driver was able to use the keypad at my apartment building and I was able to allow them access to my building.  The next day TFORCE again claimed to be out for delivery and again claimed to have been denied access to my building.  At the end of day two, my package was marked as \"return to sender\". I checked the front of my building and our mail room, there was no pick up slip left by the delivery driver.  The fact that their drivers are not trained on how apartment buildings work and do not allow for later pick up is so strange.  When I contacted their customer service I was told once packages are returned to sender it is out of their hands.  When I asked why my buzzer was never rung or why I was never called to grant building access I never received a response.Date of experience: November 04, 2021Eddy J.

This was the worse shipping company I have worked with in my 20+ years in shipping and transporting goods. Customer service is outsourced so they only give you information from a script, can hardly understand them since the accents are very thick. You know it's bad when their dock workers tell you their customers service people don't know what they're talking about. I would not use them ever again, my shipment was not delivered even though they told me it would. I had to rent a UHaul, hire two people to go to the dock and pick up my 3 pallets. When asked for a partial refund because of the additional cost, they said no. There is a reason they have a poor rating.

First the tracking number was for someone else's shipment, called and was told I just need to wait and see if the shipment would be correct. When I explained that this was not the correct shipment and I need answers, they hung up on me. The next agent dug deeper and found our correct tracking number, now they say the shipment is sitting in a T-Force hub waiting for transit, per the offshore answering service or it could be in-route. Unfortunately we tried them this time after they charged triple the quote for a previous shipment. The company shipping the products uses them, to make things easy for them, we had them handle the shipping again.Backstory, TForce was very good until they broke away from UPS. for the past few years we used them through UPS and we never had any problems. Since late 2023 they have transitioned away from having any UPS involvement and it really shows. NEVER AGAIN!

After doing all of these forms and spending hours on the claim. The maximum I can get because of the limited liability is $68.50. Not enough to even cover the cost of 1 item that was damaged.5 Pallets were picked up, and 16 were delivered in pieces with missing goods and broken equipmentDate of experience: April 02, 2024MSMS1 reviewUSOct 9, 2024As a former ltl employee and over 15…As a former ltl employee and over 15 years in my current line of work dealing with about 15 other ltl carriers, is the first time that I put my foot down from the start with a carrier and I have had a good number of hickups with other carriers.  This station did not pick up on time even when they said they would, and decided to lie saying that the driver was not allowed into the property, but driver never showed up and they could have said that the driver was running late or something better than lieying. Then when time to bill, they hugely ignored the bol sent to them and also provided to the driver that finally picked up, and billed incorrectly another company. Asked over and over for the invoice with no luck, Then on top when they finally billed correct party. they charged more without customary report, charged me for asking them to correct their own billing mistake, and they put residential and lift gate charges as penalty for a true commercial location pickup that has truck height dock. Do not use this station.. I have worked with other TF stations and those others have mega rocked. Seen other opinions now and my own, this station should be restructured because they lie, they do not care from the start and abuse the customers with errors. As of today almost 3 months of follow-up, still asking them to fix their mistakes. They are soooo bad that they earned my first review here.

I knew better than to even unload them, but I felt sorry for the driver having them in his way.

Tforce customer service rep lie. They have no clue on what there procedures are. Had to go back and fourth with a kbown sneaker company starts with an A and ends with an S and Tforce about my package. Long story short Tforce is in the wrong.  CSR need to be retrained or fired. Still have not received my package. Stay away from Tforce delivery. CSR HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO DO THERE JOBs.😡😡😡🤡🤡🤡. BOTTOM LINE STAY AWAY. If I could give a negative rating I would.

I took pictures and provided all the required documantation to the UPS store. T Force doesn't deal with customers. At all. When the UPS store manager submitted the paperwork, following T Force policy, Jennifer Knuckles, the claims inspector, promptly 'archived' it (down the toilet) This is 3 months later and easily a dozen emails from the UPS manager. Jennifer remains MIA. No ability to contact her directly. I leave phone messages. UPS leaves messages. Nothing from Jennifer. Her boss also totally MIA. I paid for insurance on my packages. That was a worthless investment. If you want to be cheated, lied to, screwed, and then ignored . . . T Force is the company for you. I hope they capsize.Date of experience: August 11, 2024alex g1 reviewUSSep 12, 2024Horrible companyHorrible company, Worst of the worst, I have yet to encounter the worst company than this one.

I have spent days on the phone getting hung up on and just transferred back and forth between answering services they will not figure it out or let me talk to a supervisor. Do not recommend to anyone. Each person tells me they submitted a case and they will contact me from the distribution center in a day. After 20 of those and no calls back i am ready to show up at their door. Answering desks sound like they are in china horrid english. Sick of these trash companies. Tforce should be ran out of business. Date of experience: July 01, 2024STStefanie3 reviewsUSUpdated Sep 4, 2024Terrible serviceTerrible service! A package was supposed to be delivered to my residence. I received an update on the tracking and this company claims it's a bad address. Meanwhile, I had a delivery 2 days prior from the same vendor and the same shipping company. I emailed them and they said provide a good address. Tracking was then updated after providing the same address on the shipping label. A day later it was out for delivery, then delivered \"with proof\", which was a photo of a house that was not my residence, as well as a package that was not the package being sent to me! Some of these drivers lie and steal packages! Why any retailer contracts with them is very hard to understand. There's no way they're not losing a ton of money using this fraudulent company!Date of experience: August 19, 2024barbaralynnmeyer1 reviewUSJul 10, 2024This company was contacted to deliver three large pieces of office equipmentThis company was contacted to deliver three large pieces of office equipment.   We received the the  equipment in damaged condition.  The damage was from very poor handling, probably from being dropped and was totally unusable.   Cost our company a tremendous amount of money.

Date of experience: March 21, 2024Dennis McQuoid1 reviewUSJun 20, 2024Having seen the scathing reviews on…Having seen the scathing reviews on this company, I was worried when my freight was booked through tforce. I had a rather complicated shipment to a small outer island in Hawaii from the Midwest. My shipment had to trucked to the West Coast, sent by ship to Honolulu, and then on a local ship to my island of Molokai. The shipment arrived right on time. I guess the company is working to fix its issues. Date of experience: June 20, 2024NRNoah Ross1 reviewUSAug 7, 2024Lack of accountablilityTforce billed me 70$ for a reweigh fee. They said it was a 515lb pallet... Absolute false. We send multiple of these pallets out with the same product on them and they are ALWAYS 310lbs. All info was given to them correctly. They charged us an additional 70$ for what? Not only that but customer service is about as sloppy as anything Ive ever had. They kept transferring me to other departments and then whenever I was at the correct department they couldn't even find/pull up the bill they sent me? I gave them the invoice number and everything and they couldn't find it. Probably because its not a real invoice but just a money grab.Date of experience: August 07, 2024SASarah2 reviewsUSJul 10, 2024DO NOT USE!!!! HORRIBLE!!!! STAY AWAY!!!!If I could rate them a 0 I would. We have stuff shipped all the time and every single time a company uses T-Force Freight to ship to us it's a horrible experience. They lose your pallets, take their time delivering your items and won't do anything to help you when you have an issue. They will just deliver your freight whenever they feel like it. If you have any sense at all you will never use this company. Spend ehe couple extra $1's to use someone more reliable!!! Date of experience: July 07, 2024BUF1 reviewUSJul 2, 2024Since this company disconnected from UPS Worldship it's been all downhillSince this company disconnected from the UPS software they have become almost useless.

I called Nordies to explain that we do not have problems receiving our packages and that simple research (which led me here) shows that this carrier should not be used as one of their vendors. I hope my feedback helps remove them as a delivery service in the future. Date of experience: May 31, 2024Jackie Strong1 reviewUSJun 11, 2024TOTAL FRAUD! Do not use!Total frauds. They will NOT deliver your shipment! Six days we have been waiting. Delivery has been \"guaranteed\" each day for six days. Nothing. I have spent hours on the phone. Customer service \"sends messages\" to the terminal but it does nothing. Local VM is full. We paid extra for this nonsense service! This company is a scam.Date of experience: June 11, 2024JEJeff2 reviewsUSMar 12, 2024They did not do the final deliveryThey did not do the final delivery. Made excuses about trucks and then days for the trucks, then said one day, then didn't show and then said they didn't know when. So, we pay for a pickup AND delivery service, and only received the pickup service. We had to do the final delivery ourselves. No recompense, just excuses and really crappy attitude from the final depot people. Unreal and unprofessional a**holes hiding behind UPS. Never again.Date of experience: March 11, 2024Ken Sherman2 reviewsUSMay 3, 2023Worst Shipping Company On Planet EarthActually, Zero stars is what they are worth. Over 9 days late, 4 rescheduled deliveries....actually rescheduled because they never showed up 4 times.  No call, no show, no service.  We were told several times that it would be delivered, it wasn't. Ultimately, we had to hire an emergency driver to go pick our materials up from this crappy shipping company.  If you are thinking of using T Force, don't.

They stole a package with some expensive shoes. Claimed they delivered it to the back door- in a gated area, single family home. They wouldn't even have ACCESS to the back door! Liars! They stole $800 Blahnik pumps. Some delivery person is probably selling them on the street.

I promise that you will be disappointed.  They have become the worst carrier our company has ever used in our 26 years of business.  They lost an entire PALLET of ours going to Grand Canyon, AZ.  They also have decided to wait until they get other pickup/delivery requests for individual companies (not areas) to deliver pallets without even asking consignees.

TForce Freight charged me for lift gate delivery, but refused to come an inch into my driveway. Didn't know that, even after I had spoken to the dispatcher and informed them that I was expecting it delivered up the driveway. I was told if I didn't come down and get it with my pickup, I would be charged a redelivery fee and a storage fee until I picked it up myself.

I got a lot of miss information, too many third party companies involved. It took me 8 weeks to ship a counter top from Ft Lauderdale FL to New York City. I kept getting different prices and quotes. No one knew what was going on. I ended up at one time telling them to just keep the countertop. After four weeks, they ended up delivering it to me at the quoted price. Even the delivery was a disaster. One guy just sat in the truck while one other guy struggled to get my countertop off the truck. I had to end up helping them.

Got disconnected after 5 minutes on hold, then the next person I spoke with basically said, yeah, you are  not getting that today and I am not sure when the truck will be in your area.  We are in CT for crissakes. You can get across the state in an hour and change.  Unacceptable.  I do not recommend T Force as a shipper unless you don't  want to get your shipment as promised.Date of experience: February 28, 2024NBNicole Butler2 reviewsUSJul 19, 20235 Star ServiceI personally had a great experience with TForce.

Not only did he communicate well, he unloaded the pallet, pushed each box into the house and had a smile on his face throughout the process. From beginning to end my experience was positive. He went above and beyond to help me get several heavy boxes of furniture into the house. I appreciated his kindness.Date of experience: July 11, 2023RERenee3 reviewsUSOct 25, 2023Lost MaterialsThey lost my conference materials just from Cincinnati to DC and would hang up every time I tried to reach customer service to locate them after spending truly hours waiting through phone menus and holds.

Arrived in the time requested.  It was raining and the package was 170 lbs and he brought it right into the house for me. Well done!Date of experience: November 08, 2023AdvertisementDMDiana Miller1 reviewUSAug 20, 2021Property DamageWhen our package got delivered the driver drove into our spectrum cable overhead and pulled it from the cable box leaving the cable stretched and hanging down over our driveway. They did not place our package in the location as per instructions and when our package was opened there was significant damage to our product. When we contacted the company and provided pictures of damage, they denied any liability and tried to blame the previous weeks storms on the damage. When the Spectrum repairman came out later that evening he concurred with our assessment that the driver caught our cable with his truck and pulled it with force. I would not recommend this company unless damage to your property is not a concern.Date of experience: August 20, 2021CMChad Moss1 reviewUSAug 10, 2016InvitedVery accommodating!I haven't used the services enough to form much of an opinion, but our needs were met and the company was very accommodating to our needs.They were very professional and prompt on the pick up and delivery times.Date of experience: August 10, 2016SDSAMANTHA DRAPER1 reviewUSAug 10, 2015InvitedOutstanding Service, Above and Beyond the anticipatedA customer absolutely needed our products the next day and we discovered this at 3pm on a Friday afternoon.

I found Sam day delivery on line. I explained my situation to Justin Peroli at 6:45 PM and he immediately called a driver to head my way while I started filling out the paperwork that he e-mailed me. Within 90 min the driver was picking up the rush shipment. Delivery made it to the destination before the ETA.

We had to get replacement clear plastic tops sent from Phoenix, AZ to New York on Monday. Due to the size of the crate, we couldn't use our usual air cargo company. Kevin Carpenter at Air Freight dot com was able to find a plane with a cargo door large enough for our crate, and the crate arrived at JFK airport in time for the install in Times Square. Without Air Freight dot com we could not have installed the candles on time.Date of experience: June 10, 2015SCSatisfied Customer1 reviewUSJun 21, 2016InvitedIt Went Great!We contacted SameDayDelivery for an emergency shipment that needed to travel over 200 miles.

Read the reviews carefully2nd Update: I posted my review BEFORE reading the other reviews. Now I see almost every single bad review experienced the same as me. Skynet claiming to have attempted delivery but no one came. CCTV and security guards to prove it with no one answering their calls.  I wonder where there packages are going Skynet? Something fishy happening over there?UPDATE: i have tried calling 4 times with no luck. Nothing on whatsapp. Call just cuts now. Their systems and delivery process is the worst i have experience in South Africa. Avoid at all costs.Try give their number a call. I have called twice, first time i sat on the phone waiting for someone to answer. I am now on the phone again and no answer for 12 mins. What do i do?The delivery guys sent a message to say no one was home when someone was waiting all day. We have cctv cameras outsite and no one pitched for delivery, which means they made a mistake and went to wrong house or didnt call.phone them and every 5 seconds this irritating voice says:\"Your call is very important to us, please wait for the next available agent\"and that is why i had to cut to the call.

The delivery driver called my phone for delivery and I missed it as I was in the shower. I called back 4 times within 3 minutes and they did not pick up or leave a voicemail. After this customer service told me my shipment number didn’t exist anymore, and after speaking to someone on the phone they told me a voicemail had been left, which had not, saying my parcel was being returned to sender. The woman on the phone, from the Manchester branch was rude and hung up the phone after telling me she’s not lying, I never accused her of lying? Was just trying to understand the situation.

On the negative side it took a month for Skynet to deliver from Italy to Sweden and for most of that time the tracking didn’t work, which begs the question; why did I pay extra for trackable shipping?

Incompetent drivers and awful client support!Date of experience: November 08, 2023Bernadette Iyodu1 reviewSGNov 22, 2023Shipment from UK to SingaporeGosh, what awful service! Twice, my parcels from the UK haven't been delivered and still waiting. Terrible lies that parcel is out for delivery and both times, I am home all day with the door wide open so I don't miss the delivery fellow. Haven't received either parcel and the number provided to contact rings on end, no answer to emails as well.  I'm going to have to self collect yet I paid for shipment. I'd recommend that retailers drop SkyNet as a courier, they are most unreliable.Date of experience: November 22, 2023Jesus MA1 reviewESJun 10, 2024Your lack of professionalism and…Your lack of professionalism and transparency is incredible, 2 lost packages in a week and I send an email for you to give me explanations of what happened and it tells me that they can't find anything with the tracking number that I give them, and anyone can see it on their website official that with my tracking number the packages appear at their headquarters in Barcelona (Spain). I write again attaching all the evidence and papers... and what is your response? NONE. So soon you will have me in the consumer office denounced and claiming what is mine and of course in my networks and those of my loved ones I am going to portray youDate of experience: June 10, 2024Rosita Bugiolacchio3 reviewsESJul 10, 2024Horrible experienceMy parcel, which left from Italy, arrived in Barcelona where it has been stopped for more than a month (it was supposed to arrive in A Coruña, Galicia). I got in touch with customer service and sent a million emails receiving only nonsensical replies, and was finally told that since my parcel contained food, it could not be delivered. I spent more than 40 euros for the delivery (in addition to the money spent on the goods the package contained) and was not even given the opportunity to return it to the sender. I was completely ignored and, what's more, having contracted the Skynet company through Packlink, I was not required to read the strange rules about not being able to send food (written in a guide that can't even be found online), as there are no such restrictions in Packlink. I hope at least in Barcelona they enjoyed the lunch they prepared with MY PRODUCTS paid for with MY MONEY. Enjoy!Date of experience: July 01, 2024AdvertisementHarsimran Singh1 reviewNZApr 15, 2024One of the worst courier services I…One of the worst courier services I have dealt with. Their delivery guy just left my international parcel (India to New Zealand) next to my rubbish bins outside of my house premises and he didn't contacted me, even though my contact number was clearly mentioned on the parcel.I e-mailed them along with the pics as a proof and they said that they use PBT as their delivery partners and there is nothing much they can do with it. They said that it's PBT's headache not ours. So, he just forwarded my e-mail to PBT. They will keep running away from responsibilities as the person sitting on top is not aware of it's brands face value.So, if you want that type of service, you should definitely choose Skynet Courier as your provider.Date of experience: April 11, 2024Mamoru Moriyama7 reviewsGBFeb 23, 2024Parcel lostI’m not sure how this courier is still in business with so many horrible reviews…I had a parcel sent from India to UK from a family using different courier. Once it reached the UK on Feb 5, it was taken over by Skynet. I checked tracking status on Feb 22 and it shows parcel has been declared lost. When I emailed their customer service, I received a generic response saying, “Unfortunately, this parcel has been declared lost by our courier. We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused.”Their advice is to contact the sender for a refund/replacement. It wasn’t a purchased item so refund/replacement isn’t possible.

Verduras1 reviewESApr 30, 2024Skynet: really bad experience Skynet has a horrible service. I paid a delivery through packlink with them and it went very bad. The labels of my package were wrong so when FedEx (TNT) came to pick it up they refused to take it. Two weeks trying to pick up the delivery which never happend. Really bad service also to ask them, contact them or try to solve the situation. Date of experience: April 19, 2024Advertisementroxanne pozzi1 reviewITMar 1, 20232 Parcel sent, 1st still not delivered (1 month waiting)2 parcel booked for courier service. Booked for home collection (TNT, local service they use). Both times they did not show on the day booked, not time given just 9-6. So wasted 2 days. Then they appear the next day with no notification, the first time I was just closing my gate to out when I saw a FedEX Van and waited thinking it may be a delivery (FedEx are part of TNT apparently). They came to collect to parcel. First parcel collected 22nd January and still not delivered, hasn't even left Milan, sent several emails to them, no response. I only give 2 stars as the second parcel was delivered from Italy to US within 2 weeks.Date of experience: February 27, 2023AJAJ1 reviewZAJan 15, 2024Pathetic Servicei ordered a parcel from ASOS and Skynet is the courier company. The parcel has been on hold at Skynet since the 3rd of January 2024. When you phone them to enquire what the hold up is, they want to know the waybill number to track the parcel!! Am i being stupid thinking that THEY must issue the waybill number so if parcel is on hold at their office how can a waybill have been issued? They cannot assist you when you try to give them the ASOS order Number. Absolutely useless!!!!!Date of experience: January 12, 2024APAkbar Parker2 reviewsZAUpdated Nov 9, 2022Horrible serviceI was informed of delivery on Tuesday. Waited until 20.00 - no delivery. I called the Cape Town branch office on Wednesday morning and w,a s told that they contacted the driver and the delivery will be made 15.00. It is now 17.31. Still sitting and waiting like a fool. This is the most inefficient courier I've  come across. A delivery was nade by a different courier after one day, yes one ! I think skynet should be avoided at all cost because they lie through their teeth and take their customers for fools.

Claims to have attempted to deliver when I was at home! Disgraceful liars or super incompetent in their job - either way not to be trusted by anyone. Send a lousy link some days after that doesn't even work. Contacted the retail company and they said will cancel the order so I don't have to deal with these people anymore. Really hope they loose all their contract soon as it's a shame for any retailer to be working with them.Date of experience: April 03, 2022AdvertisementShaista Rameez2 reviewsUSAug 21, 2024Horrible serviceMy shipment from Pakistan to U.S. has been bouncing around in the U.S. from city to city for weeks and has not been delivered to me. Horrible service and no way to talk to them in the U.S., you have to call a number in Pakistan if your shipment originated in Pakistan. Call rates between US and Pakistan being what they are, do we have money to burn, that we we will first pay for the package and the shipping and then spend money following up because the carrier is playing passing the parcel with our shipment? Anyone who lives in the US can understand that a package to be delivered to the east coast has no business bouncing around in Nebraska, especially since it landed in NewYork as its port of entry to the U.S. It has gone a full circle from Omaha back to Omaha in the last 4-5 days, while I wait for it on the east coast.

No one they're seems to know what they're doing. I'm an independent trucker and have never in 40 years been paid in advance for freight. You are refusing to pick up my trailer to deliver to me until I pay, yet you can't even invoice me properly. I can get in my own truck and go get my own trailer quicker than you can bring it to me.

I’m sorry to hear about your experience. This isn't like the excellent service we strive to provide and seems unusual. Would you mind sending more information to marketing@trinitylogistics.com? If you could send those exact shipment numbers or your USDOT, we can investigate this further and see how we may be able to resolve this issue for you. UPDATE:Josh, thank you again for reaching out and following up with more information on the marketing email. This indeed looked suspicious, and we were able to confirm that this was not one of our shipments, the rate confirmations sent to you were falsified, and the person you booked this shipment with, Hector Walsh, does not and has never worked with Trinity Logistics. Again, I'm sorry you are dealing with this unfortunate freight fraud situation. It is greatly appreciated that you spoke out about it so we can do our part to hold this fraudster accountable for their actions of falsely representing themselves as Trinity Logistics and scamming quality carriers such as yourself.

What if I was on my own? We've had a row over this as if I had known XPO Logistics Homebase appointed for the delivery would do this, I would have been straight down and told them to take the sofa bed back and expected a refund.

This is the worst billing nightmare we have every dealt with as a company. XPO has no clue what they are doing, the reps are essentially useless because their hands are tied on everything and they even manage to somehow lose record that bills were paid. We have been fighting bogus charges on bills for months. We pay the quoted price and then dispute the bogus charges but XPO manages to somehow not even record that the quoted price was paid. Do yourself a favor and find another carrier.Date of experience: July 01, 2024Joana Anjo4 reviewsPTSep 6, 2024Worst company everWorst company ever!

Failed to deliver on date they chose, then lied to cover failure by saying no-one was in, when I said I was in all day they changed it to I didnt answer my phone.  But they didnt ring and there was no missed call. They said they would investigate but never responded.  Rearranged delivery.  They Text on 5th September to say good news your delivery will be on 31/8  Rang they could only find record of half the delivery and even now some 3 weeks on am still waiting for delivery.  My advice avoid them like the plague. Insist with Homebase you don't want delivery by this shower, or go to another furniture company.

A family member was on a roundabout and one of their drivers decided he had enough of waiting and pulls straight out causing a day old car a write off as he tears the front off the car causing damage beyond repair. Then has the audacity to blame the crash on family member who has right of way! What the heck?! It’s all on camera mate, YOU were and are at FAULT! He was extremely rude, shouted at other folk who were taking time out of their day to help my family member, as she was shaken up. Clearly this company employs driver who are dangerous and bullies. Oh, and the cherry on top, no apology from anyone at this company, disgusting. Date of experience: June 28, 2024SHSarah Hadaway4 reviewsGBDec 9, 2023Absolutely awfulAbsolutely awful.  The drivers are a liability- our latest experience is when they hit our gate post - drove off. Thankfully we caught it on CCTV - they couldn’t deny it after pretending they didn’t hit our gatepost!  They then tried to intimidate me into bodging a repair!  Now we are locked into a battle to get a proper repair.  Management aren’t management but cowboys - don’t trust XPO or any of their sub contractors.Date of experience: November 21, 2023AdvertisementNINienke18 reviewsGBSep 9, 2024Never had a worse delivery experienceMy Homebase kitchen was delivered by XPO. They only deliver two days a week. On the day of delivery, I made sure there was someone at my flat at all times, but they just phoned me and never rang the bell. This caused significant delays to the building of my kitchen as they would not come back until almost a whole week later. When they did come back, they forgot several key items including the worktop - which took additional days before these came and I was never phoned or consulted if these new rearranged delivery times suited.  When I repeatedly asked for the proof of delivery photo from the first original attempt, I was only send this a week later when they had come to my flat 2x and the timestamp on the photo was way before when they phoned me to announce the delivery. XPO also did not provide any compensation for this whole ordeal, leaving this to Homebase who in my opinion did not provide suitable financial compensation for the extent of the issues I experienced. I would highly encourage anyone to stay away from any companies that use XPO for their delivery.

The two guys who were supposedly employees of Home Depot, which I was originally told when I purchased the item at the store said that was not the case. I had a major issue a few years prior with a third-party delivery service from an HD order. Once again, I was lied to by the sales person at the local Home Depot.

I had a call to arrange delivery 26th July and had agreed a date 3rd August. The day arrives and I heard nothing about the item being delivered and it never came. Rang to see where it was, the first time I got hung up on and the next I got put on hold and never got through to customer support. In the end I rang the original company Keter, they found out it had been delayed and they sorted the issue and arranged another delivery date without me knowing. Still have no reason for it not arriving! Finally 1 week after they originally said they would deliver it has arrived. The delivery drivers were extremely rude, wanted me to sign before even seeing the item (that was still inside the van) and wanted me to carry a shed by myself out the van and round the back. I said I wouldn’t be able to do that and they reluctantly carried it round the back while speaking to each other about me.  Overall an awful experience and will never be using this company ever again.Date of experience: August 10, 2024Guildford Burrito1 reviewGBMay 9, 2023Worst ever serviceIf I could give zero start I would.

XPO hired 3rd party drivers which do whatever they want and XPO has no control over them, they are also 4 days behind. If you contact XPO via email, they are illiterate. If you call you get routed to the local XPO office which is not helpful. If you call other ones in your chain it is pretty much the same. The tracking system is terrible from the customer standpoint and doesn't tell you anything. I even went as far as finding the VP of customer service on LinkedIn and telling her to look at how terrible reviews are and that XPO is a terrible company to work with. This is one that people should get behind to cancel.

After many calls and email, fauls promises, hours on hold, days sitting in waiting we had to try and cancel the order.Of 2 companies I have used for home delivers from XPO (Costco/Homebase) only once have they delivered when they said.

XPO called at 9:21 on a Monday morning to say they would not be delivering my item on Wednesday. XPO emailed later that same day (3-4 hours later) to set up the same delivery for over a week past the scheduled date. The item is in their possession less than 90 minutes from my location and it will take them almost 10 days to deliver it.

I purchased an electric wheel chair which was shipped from the east coast to Portland, Oregon.  It was put on the wrong truck in Salt Lake City, Utah and was delayed by 3 days.  It is now at their depot in Oregon, about 10 miles from my home, but will not be delivered to me for 2 to 4 days from now.  I asked to pick it up at their depot but can't because it is in another truck going to their contracted delivery company which is about 40 miles from me.  Does not make sense and is very inefficient.  A projected 4 to 7 day delivery by the seller has now been 14 days and I still do not have the chair.Date of experience: April 23, 2024Zafer Derinsu1 reviewUSSep 3, 2022A company (XPO) that should never be preferredI have purchased an item from Samsung. Unfortunately, their contracted logistics company was XPO Logistics. I have rescheduled delivery date at the 1st time for XPO request as their schedule, but they called me in day scheduled for requesting 2nd schedule day that their excuse was no any space in their truck.

Swift Transportation was the delivery company.   Yes, I had to pay for the shipping.   They delivered my ladder this morning.   One side of the ladder was destroyed...bent metal support, broken rivets, and the aluminum steps bent.  The delivery driver concealed the damage by laying the ladder on the ground with the damaged side down.  Then he drove off instead of returning the ladder to Home Depot and letting them know that a replacement would be necessary.  I got an email within a minute of the delivery and found the damaged ladder outside.  I immediately called Home Depot, who in turn called Swift.  Within 5 minutes of the delivery, they had Swift on the phone and asked them to pick up the ladder since they were only 5 minutes away.   The delivery driver refused to come back to pick up the damaged item.  This is a company with poor ethics...and I'm imagining that this is what they trained their employees to do.  Otherwise, they would be taking responsibility for the shipping damages.

If you call to ask for disposition, you are ignored.  If you file your own claim for damaged goods and the freight company (in the unlikely event) pays the broker for the damages, you will NEVER see that money.  This is because they apply it to your open invoices EVEN IF THEY ARE IN DISPUTE.  These guys are out for your money.

They initially lost my products, and after several weeks of waiting, they finally located them and delivered them to us. However, upon receipt, we discovered that the pallets were unpacked, and many items were damaged and missing. Despite the driver noting the damage and losses on the POD, filing a claim with GlobalTranz was a nightmare. The agent handling our claim was extremely reluctant and took days to process it, all while being rude and disrespectful to our team. We were even pressured to pay the invoices first, despite them being inflated with reclassifications and added fees. Despite our compliance, our claim, filed over a year ago, remains unresolved.Overall, GlobalTranz is dishonest, unprofessional, disorganized, and has the worst customer service imaginable. While I typically refrain from leaving negative reviews, I feel compelled to warn others about their poor practices. I sincerely hope no one else has to endure the same ordeal. If possible, I would give them negative 100 stars. Proceed with caution if considering their services, as you may end up regretting it as much as I do.Date of experience: July 17, 2023Reply from GlobalTranzApr 25, 2024Hello, I'm sorry to hear this.

We've moved the same type of product with Estes in the past and never had them refuse to carry it. They're refusing to do anything about it when it was clearly their fault.

This is my second experience with them, and it is no better than the first. Previously, closely to 50% of the shipment was smashed and beyond redemption. This time, I have been waiting for a delivery since last week, and each time there is a different story, and I have to keep repeating myself including correcting my phone number at least three times so far! Worse, they work with a home delivery partner called \"Humble\" in Massachusetts, who are even more ridiculous than Estes. Phone messages are not returned, and information is provided as drip-drip-drip, so each time one has to go through the torture of navigating their phone system, then speak with someone at the other end of the Pacific whose responses are so obtuse, you wonder if they are lifelings on Mars! Henceforth, I will always check if a vendor ships through Estes or Humble first, and if so, will not do business with that company.

The dresser was left blocking my garage door. Both times I had to hire someone to move. They DO NOT CARE AT ALL about their service.

They inspect my seriously well packed Canoe, arbitrarily inspect it a 2nd time later on in the course of crossing 10 states.  Some Flippin genius determines I am shipping gold dust or ping pong balls when he re-assigns my freight as class 500. Then they throw out the hard quote made by THEIR OWN SALES MANAGER for Iowa / Illinois region.  And after multiple protests refuse to face their own ineptitude.  Done with this POS carrier. They blew off pickups for 5 days, repeatedly documented by emails in lies, and tried to blame the client for missing appointments while I sat at dock all day waiting for their own directions. Now I see just why they forced an across the board hike in rates in January 23.  They must be losing their backside with these bad business practices. Just so pathetic!

This could literally be 9 paragraphs but suffice to say THE WORST DELIVERY & TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICEDate of experience: October 21, 2023juli.fisheryahoo.com1 reviewUSMay 10, 2023Lost a door I ordered from Home Depot…Lost a door I ordered from Home Depot and every time either I or Home Depot called they needed yet another 72 hours to do a \"camera search\".  Finally after two weeks and Estes still not admitting they lost the door, Home Depot told me to dispute the charge and they reordered.  I asked them NOT TO USE Estes.  We will see.Date of experience: May 10, 2023AdvertisementJ C1 reviewUSJan 17, 2024Worst shipping companyWorst shipping company! I have been waiting 4 weeks for delivery, when they finally called to set up a time to deliver between the hours of 10am to 4pm where they make a point to outline that you MUST be there during this time. They never showed up, no call, nothing. This is the second time I’ve used them and I won’t be using them a third time. Such a joke. Hard to imagine how they’ve made it this far.Date of experience: January 16, 2024Mark Ray1 reviewUSMar 21, 2023Worst company everWorst company ever! Won't return calls.

Really bad. Avoid them and save yourself from many headachesDate of experience: July 14, 2022AdvertisementBPBilly P1 reviewUSOct 1, 2021Estes refuses to pay for damage to my equipmentEstes shipped a very expensive, non replaceable piece of machinery for my Metal Fabrication business. The forklift driver drove into the machine instead of picking it up from under the pallet. They damaged the front panel and broke all of the controls, all of the linkages and the foot control pedals. They caused $16,000 in damage to my equipment. I paid for the damage and submitted a claim with proof of cost and payment and they denied my claim. How can a company cause $16K worth of damage to someone’s equipment and then get away with not paying for it. I am a small business owner that makes American made products and keep employees on payroll even through the Covid downturn. This is a substantial hit to my business and a logistic that doesn’t care. Don’t use this company, they have no values and will not cover the damage they cause. They get bonuses based on how much they deny in claims so they are quick to deny you. This is a horrible business practice, they set up their employees to deny claims so they get bigger checks.Date of experience: October 01, 2021LMlawrence mack2 reviewsUSJul 8, 2023Professional teamsMarcus,Jeff,Damey andJoel were professional,effecientand knowlegeable,Marcus gave a description of the work to be performed,laid out a timeframe for completion answered any and all questions completelynot leaving us with ant doubts whatsoeverDate of experience: July 08, 2023SBSteve Burgess4 reviewsUSMay 14, 2022Worst delivery company I ever dealt…Worst delivery company I ever dealt with... do not use them if you can avoid it. they only have semis with trailers for delivery and no drivers that can back one up a long driveway. Our order instructions (from them) was they would deliver it to the nearest dry spot by our home. Instead they left it alongside a 2 lane highway and did not even notify us they did so...after we had told them we have no way to move a 200lb box on a pallet up a long driveway. Their last response was they would find an 'experienced' driver the next day to deliver it. Instead they drop it on the highway roadside and when we call they say the delivery is \"curbside\" which to them is along the highway. Then they hung up on us. I have personally run large distribution systems myself and never even heard of such poor practices, lack of communication, and irresponsible people. What a mess! Cannot say anything good about this company. They do not deserve 1 star.Date of experience: May 14, 2022Ellen Gutermuth3 reviewsUSSep 6, 2023drop and runI was home and they just dropped the pallet in my driveway.  Garage door was up, obviously home, other contractors around, and no one could be bothered to tell me they were here.  Now I have a pallet with a half-ton item that needs to go in the garage.  Would have been nice if they had rang the doorbell.  One star because I can’t give zero.Date of experience: September 06, 2023AdvertisementBBBill Bridier1 reviewUSDec 26, 2022The No Communication CompanyWell all you have to do is read all the other ONE STAR reviews and you will have a clear and TRUE picture of ESTS Transportation.

I have never been treated this bad by a delivery service. The driver delivered my mower to the wrong address & would not come back to help me get it home. He lied to me saying he would come back in 45 minutes to an hour. He never showed up. He would not return my text or calls, he instead had his supervisor call me. He was no help either, he told me the crate would be easy to break apart with a claw hammer. Then he told me”maybe a family member could help me”. I do not have either. Then he told me the driver could not come back before the next day. I could not leave the mower because someone could come by steal it. I sat out in the heat over 5 hours before I finally found someone to help me. I called Home Depot & they sent someone out to help me.  I would not recommend this company to haul my garbage.Date of experience: July 11, 2022WBwalter bedard1 reviewUSMar 22, 2023Really…Really professional,courteous,knowledgable.Jared and Trevor did a great job.Date of experience: March 22, 2023AdvertisementMBMark Breece1 reviewUSSep 8, 2022Very poor service when it comes to…Very poor service when it comes to tracking a shipment.Date of experience: September 08, 2022LELeftIsTrash6 reviewsUSFeb 27, 2023🐒 🐵 🍌Buncha phuckin' @$$hole$ that don't care.Date of experience: February 27, 2023Wayne Burdette1 reviewUSApr 29, 2024that helped get my ari back onDate of experience: April 29, 2024Previous123Next pageIs this your company?Claim your profile to access Trustpilot’s free business tools and connect with customers.Get free accountCompany activitySee allUnclaimed profileNo history of asking for reviewsPeople review on their own initiativeIs this your company?Claim your profile to access Trustpilot’s free business tools and connect with customers.Get free accountAdvertisementAbout Estes Express LinesInformation provided by various external sourcesOffers a full spectrum of shipping and supply chain management services.CategoryBusiness ServicesPeople who looked at this company also looked attforcefreight.com331UnclaimedXPO886ClaimedSaia Motor Freight Line, Inc.35UnclaimedSuggested companies are based on people’s browsing tendencies.The Trustpilot ExperienceWe're open to allAnyone can write a Trustpilot review.
