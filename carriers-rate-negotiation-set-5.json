Simon emphasizes the importance of automating core warehouse processes while acknowledging the challenges of handling edge cases. He shares his background in robotics and the application of deep learning in the field. Simon also highlights the potential of gecko adhesive technology for gripping and handling objects in logistics. The conversation explores the need for warehouses designed for robots and the vision of creating fully autonomous warehouses. Simon concludes by emphasizing the value of human involvement in the evolving landscape of ecommerce logistics.</p><p><br /> </p><p><strong>ABOUT SIMON</strong></p><p>Simon founded Nimble in 2017 after dropping out of his PhD at Stanford. He's spent the last 5 years inventing and scaling intelligent next-gen autonomous logistics systems. Previously Simon led development of dynamic legged robots for the Department of Defense while completing his masters in robotics at Carnegie Mellon, International Space Station robots for NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab and autonomous off-road vehicles for the Air Force Research Lab.</p><p> </p><p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS</strong><br /><br />If you try to automate all the one-offs, your warehouse will end up costing way too much.</p><p>There's always edge cases and one-off things you have to solve for in logistics.</p><p>Deep Imitation Learning allows robots to learn tasks through human demonstration.</p><p>Designing warehouses conducive to robots opens up new possibilities for automation.</p><p>The future of ecommerce logistics lies in a balance between automation and human involvement.</p><p><br /> </p><p>QUOTES</p><p><br /> </p><p>Real-World Automation Strategist, Variability Management Specialist. Simon: \u201cI saw an opportunity to deploy this in the real world. There are so many monotonous, repetitive tasks out in the real world that are, you know, that are very repetitive, but yet too hard to automate because there's a lot of variability involved. And eCommerce to film is a classic example, right? If you think about a warehouse. You know, all day long is picking and packing and picking and packing. Uh, but the part that makes that task hard to automate is that you could be picking and packing 10 million or 20 million different objects, right? And every object has a different size and shape and weight and texture and stiffness and something you're fragile.\u201d</p><p><br />Labor Optimization, Warehouse Automation. Simon: \u201cRunning a warehouse today is very hard because of the labor problem, right? The, it's, it's very hard to find, to recruit, to train and to retain hundreds or thousands of people. Um, and, and that is what makes a warehouse very challenging to operate. And then when you wanna run a network of warehouses, you're multiplying that challenge by.

Today, he talks about how delivery providers can provide the most value not only for their own service but also for their shippers.</p><p>Ben shares his experiences and insights in the small parcel industry and the philosophy behind Tusk. He discusses the importance of carrier diversification and the strategic roles that regional and national carriers have been playing for the last 10 or so years. </p><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT BEN</strong></p><p>Co-Founder and CEO of Tusk. Ben has spent his career at the overlap of small parcel shipping and ecommerce and led operations and strategic partnerships at Google Shopping and Shippo before building Tusk. </p><p>Having seen the small parcel industry from many angles \u2014 as an operator, software provider and start-up \u2014 Ben is a firm believer that any small parcel delivery provider\u2019s sole focus should be on making a meaningful, honest impact for its shippers and that volume follows value.</p><p> </p><p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p><ul><li>01:36 Accidental business? The funny story behind Ben's Dry Ice</li><li>07:12 How Tusk came about</li><li>09:49 Are regional carriers transitioning to a different model?</li><li>13:50 How UPS nailed the strategy of utilizing Amazon</li><li>20:40 Carrier diversification is the correct way</li><li>25:58 Addressing fears of not having enough volume as a brand</li><li>30:32 The strategic roles of national carriers</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>QUOTES</strong></p><p>20:59 Carrier diversification is important but there needs to be adjustments - Ben: \"We are too much of a professorial industry. Where experts tell an operator what they should do. Like, 'hey, you should diversify', you should-you should, you could-you could, it's very advice-based.\"</p><p>27:19 Regional carriers make incredible partners - Ben: \"They do right by their shippers and I would encourage every shipper out there to call a regional. The reason being is, because their op is smaller their operation is often more flexible. For example, if you have 25 pieces bound for a regional's footprint, they might give you a discounted pick-up fee or waive your pick-up fee because they already have trucks on your block.

Today, Essa shares his experience as a leader in the logistics space and how he used this background to innovate in the electric fleet market.</p><p>He talks about building a culture as a leader that encourages creativity and drive especially during challenging moments like economic crises. He also tackles how fleet owners and operators can smoothly transition to the electric models from the traditional combustion engine systems.</p><p>Essa recognizes how much of a challenge this change can be but also discusses the overall benefit of the sustainable truck for urban distribution.</p><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT ESSA</strong></p><p>Essa Al-Saleh is the CEO and a Board Member of Swedish electric-vehicle manufacturer Volta Trucks, an electric commercial vehicle company that is leading the transition from the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) ecosystem to a safe and sustainable truck for urban distribution. Volta Trucks is driving the transition with its re-imagined, superior product and its \u201cTruck as a Service\u201d solution which seeks to de-risk the transition for fleet operators.</p><p>He previously spent more than two decades at Agility Global Integrated Logistics in Baar, Switzerland, where he was appointed president and CEO in 2007.

Steven, along with Dan and Ninaad, also discusses the Amazon Effect, how consumer expectations have changed due to this, what brands and logistics companies must do to keep up, and the various factors that influence if and when they should match this speed of fulfillment. ABOUT STEVEN Steven Ciemcioch was named President of Warehouse Anywhere, a Life Storage Company, in 2018 and previously served as Corporate Alliance Manager in which he developed and headed the corporate sales division at Life Storage. He has extensive experience in building and scaling businesses in a high-growth environment. He has leadership experience across a diverse set of disciplines including sales and marketing, customer service, operations, supply chain, real estate, and finance. HIGHLIGHTS 01:35 Growing Life Storage and creating a national self-storage aggregating network through Warehouse Anywhere 13:42 Executing same-day delivery by deploying top 5% SKUs in MFCs 21:26 The Amazon effect and when customers are willing to wait for their purchases 35:19 Last mile for retail and utilizing the gig economy for fulfillment QUOTES 30:54 The Amazon Effect is most apparent in general merchandise - Ninaad: \"If you're a general merchandise and that stuff exists on walmart.com, amazon.com, and you have these sites and marketplaces that are giving you the next-day, 2-day delivery experiences, consumers will pay couple of extra dollars and get it with that options.\" 31:48 MFCs maintain a boutique feel that is lost in Amazon Effect - Steven: \"One thing I like about the MFC model, and you guys can appreciate this is, in our smaller centers, it allows a little bit of a more boutique-y feel and right now we're handling a lot of various products in the MFCs from our large fulfillment center. A lot of apparel like Ninaad talked about but I see the MFCs evolving more into that health and beauty, that craft beer space, especially we talk about dense marketplace. People sitting around in a large city, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, big demand weeknights and weekends where they just want something and they just want it quick.\" Find out more about Steven in the links below: LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-ciemcioch-38278773/ Website: https://www.warehouseanywhere.com/</itunes:subtitle>\n<itunes:keywords>dan coll, ecom logistics podcast, micro-fulfillment center, warehouse anywhere, steven ciemcioch, self-storage, ninaad acharya, the amazon effect</itunes:keywords>\n<itunes:explicit>false</itunes:explicit>\n<itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>\n<itunes:episode>17</itunes:episode>\n</item>\n<item>\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">eae23d73-cc40-4111-a188-15175b7cf99d</guid>\n<title>How to Disrupt Fulfillment Using Sustainable Initiatives with George Wojciechowski</title>\n<description>\n<![CDATA[ <p>For this episode of the eCom Logistics Podcast, we welcome George Wojciechowski, the CEO of Manifest, an e-commerce fulfillment provider.

For years, the modes of operations have become wasteful and make it harder to compete with giants with hyper-scale abilities. Shekar explains how the supply chain isn't your competitive advantage. But before we can dive into the solutions proposed by Shekar, we must reflect on the problem. As Shekar explains, the current state of the supply chain isn't built to help the mid-level brands scale. As they simply can't leverage the same level of assets and resources, hypergiants like Walmart and Amazon can. <br /> <br />Why is this important?

For years, the modes of operations have become wasteful and make it harder to compete with giants with hyper-scale abilities. Shekar explains how the supply chain isn't your competitive advantage. But before we can dive into the solutions proposed by Shekar, we must reflect on the problem. As Shekar explains, the current state of the supply chain isn't built to help the mid-level brands scale. As they simply can't leverage the same level of assets and resources, hypergiants like Walmart and Amazon can. <br /> <br />Why is this important?

                "text": "PLATFORM\nPRODUCTS\nSOLUTIONS\nCOMPANY\nRESOURCES\nOptimizing Logistics and Transportation in the Supply Chain\nAmir Taichman\nFounder & CEO\nOctober 6, 2024\nSave 5 minutes and get an AI-powered summary of this article\nSummarize\nIn today\u2019s fast-paced, competitive market, businesses are constantly looking for ways to optimize logistics and transportation to stay ahead. Efficient logistics and transportation are critical to meeting customer demands, reducing operational costs, and maintaining a competitive edge. To achieve these goals, businesses need to adopt new technologies and strategies to streamline their supply chains, improve delivery times, and cut costs. In this post, we\u2019ll discuss key strategies for optimizing logistics and transportation in the supply chain.\n1. Utilizing Route Optimization Tools for Cost-Effective Deliveries\nOne of the most effective ways to improve transportation efficiency is by implementing route optimization tools. These tools analyze real-time data, such as traffic conditions, weather patterns, and fuel prices, to determine the most efficient delivery routes. By selecting optimized routes, companies can significantly reduce mileage, fuel consumption, and overall delivery times.\nIn addition to cost savings, route optimization tools offer other key benefits, such as more accurate delivery estimates, which can enhance customer satisfaction. Businesses that use these tools can expect to deliver goods faster while also reducing their carbon footprint, which supports sustainability efforts. Overall, route optimization is a win-win for companies looking to cut costs and improve delivery times.\n2. Implementing Warehouse Automation to Streamline Logistics\nWarehouse automation plays a pivotal role in optimizing the logistics process. Technologies like automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RS) and robotic process automation (RPA) can greatly reduce the need for manual labor. Automated systems not only improve the speed and accuracy of picking, sorting, and packing goods, but they also reduce the risk of human error. This results in faster order fulfillment and fewer returns due to incorrect shipments.\nWarehouse automation also enhances inventory management, allowing businesses to keep better track of stock levels and ensure that products are available when needed. With real-time inventory tracking, companies can reduce stockouts and overstocking, leading to improved efficiency and reduced costs. By streamlining warehouse operations, businesses can cut lead times and deliver products to customers faster, enhancing overall supply chain performance.\n3. Leveraging Data Analytics for Predictive Maintenance\nFleet management is an integral aspect of optimizing transportation in the supply chain. Ensuring that vehicles are well-maintained and operational is key to minimizing delivery disruptions. Data analytics offers a powerful solution for predictive maintenance, enabling companies to monitor the condition of their fleet in real time and anticipate potential issues before they occur.\nPredictive maintenance uses historical and real-time data to forecast when a vehicle is likely to need maintenance. This allows businesses to perform repairs proactively, preventing costly breakdowns and minimizing downtime. By adopting this approach, companies can extend the lifespan of their vehicles, reduce repair costs, and ensure that deliveries remain on schedule. Additionally, fewer vehicle breakdowns contribute to lower emissions and a more sustainable transportation operation.\n4. Partnering with Third-Party Logistics Providers (3PLs)\nOutsourcing logistics operations to third-party logistics providers (3PLs) is a strategy that can greatly benefit businesses looking to optimize their supply chain. 3PLs offer a range of services, from warehousing and transportation to distribution and fulfillment. By partnering with a 3PL, companies can tap into the provider\u2019s expertise, technology, and extensive network, all of which help streamline logistics processes and reduce overhead costs.\nOne of the key advantages of using a 3PL is scalability. As businesses grow or experience seasonal fluctuations, a 3PL can adjust its services to meet the changing demands, ensuring that logistics operations run smoothly. Companies can also benefit from the latest logistics technologies and best practices offered by 3PLs without the need to invest in expensive infrastructure. Ultimately, partnering with a 3PL allows businesses to focus on their core operations while improving logistics efficiency and reducing costs.\n5. Embracing Sustainable Transportation Solutions\nSustainability is a growing priority for businesses across industries, and optimizing logistics and transportation for environmental impact is no exception. Companies are increasingly turning to sustainable transportation solutions, such as using electric or hybrid vehicles and adopting greener practices. Optimizing delivery schedules to reduce empty miles (when vehicles travel without carrying goods) and consolidating shipments are key strategies for reducing both fuel consumption and emissions.\nIn addition to environmental benefits, sustainable transportation solutions can also reduce operational costs. For example, switching to electric or hybrid vehicles lowers fuel expenses and maintenance costs over time. Additionally, embracing sustainable practices helps businesses meet corporate social responsibility (CSR) goals, which can enhance brand reputation and attract eco-conscious consumers.\n6. Enhancing Visibility with Real-Time Tracking Technologies\nVisibility is a crucial element of logistics optimization, allowing businesses to monitor the movement of goods throughout the supply chain in real time. Technologies such as GPS tracking, RFID tags, and IoT-enabled sensors provide real-time insights into the location and status of shipments. This increased transparency enables companies to quickly respond to potential disruptions, such as delays or lost shipments.\nReal-time tracking improves customer satisfaction by providing accurate delivery timelines, allowing businesses to communicate effectively with customers and avoid missed deadlines. With enhanced visibility, companies can also make better-informed decisions, such as rerouting shipments when necessary, to ensure that goods arrive on time. This added level of control and responsiveness enhances overall logistics efficiency.\n7. Adopting Multi-Modal Transportation for Flexibility and Efficiency\nMulti-modal transportation involves using a combination of transport modes, such as road, rail, air, and sea, to move goods efficiently from origin to destination. This approach allows businesses to optimize transportation by selecting the best mode or combination of modes for each shipment, based on factors such as cost, speed, and distance.\nMulti-modal transportation offers flexibility and cost savings, particularly for long-distance and international shipments. For example, goods might be shipped by sea for the bulk of their journey and then transported by truck for last-mile delivery. By diversifying transportation options, businesses can mitigate risks, reduce costs, and improve delivery times, leading to more efficient logistics operations.\nConclusion\nOptimizing logistics and transportation is essential for reducing costs, improving delivery times, and maintaining competitiveness in the global market. By leveraging advanced technologies like route optimization, warehouse automation, and real-time tracking, businesses can streamline operations and enhance overall efficiency. Partnering with 3PLs and adopting sustainable practices further contribute to cost savings and environmental responsibility. By implementing these strategies, companies can future-proof their supply chains and meet the evolving demands of customers in a dynamic market.\n\u200d\n\u200d\nBack to Blog Posts\nProducts\nUnity Shipments\nUnity Orders\nUnity D&D\nUnity AI\nSolutions\nProduct Availability\nOptimize Inventory\nEliminate Detention & Demurrage\nMinimize Inventory Risk\nOur Company\nPress\nCareers\nContact Us\nPrivacy policy\nResources\nCarrier Directory\nDemurrage & Detention Rates\nLead Time Benchmarks\n\u00a9 Copyright Unity SCM 2023"

(UPS) is the world's largest domestic and international package delivery company and a fully integrated partner with ShipEngine.\nIn addition to domestic and international services, ShipEngine accounts in the United States can also leverage UPS Mail Innovations\u00ae consolidation services via ShipEngine, if available to your UPS account.\nThis guide provides developers with the details necessary to connect and use a UPS account with ShipEngine.\nIMPORTANT\nReauthorize UPS Connection Required\nShipEngine has updated our UPS integration to UPS Auth 2.0. To avoid any disruptions with your UPS connection to ShipEngine, you must reauthorize your account connection before August 5th, 2024. For detailed steps on how to reauthorize your UPS account connection to ShipEngine, review our How To Reauthorize Your UPS Account help article.\nConnect Your Account\nShipEngine API allows you to connect your UPS accounts programmatically without logging in to the ShipEngine API dashboard. This is useful if you have wrapped a custom UI around the ShipEngine API toolset and want to add or disconnect existing carrier accounts without exposing your end users to the API dashboard.\nThese APIs can be used in parallel with the ShipEngine Partner APIs to programmatically create new ShipEngine users, and then connect existing UPS accounts all via the API without logging into a dashboard. Together these APIs empower you to completely white-label the ShipEngine experience for your end users.\nContinue below for instructions on how to programmatically connect UPS using the ShipEngine API.\nFor instructions on connecting UPS via the ShipEngine dashboard, go to our UPS help article.\nINFO\nUPS Technology Agreement\nBy connecting a UPS account, you and your users agree to the UPS Technology Agreement.\nUPS Account Information Model\nProperty Description Type Required?\nnickname This is a nickname for you to identify the carrier account in ShipEngine. string required\naccount_number Account Number string required\naccount_postal_code Account Postal Code string No\naccount_country_code Country your UPS account is based in string No\nExample Request\nPOST /v1/connections/carriers/UPS\nCopy\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\nPOST /v1/connections/carriers/ups HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.shipengine.com\nAPI-Key: __YOUR_API_KEY_HERE__\nContent-Type: application/json\n{\n\"nickname\": \"My UPS account\",\n\"account_number\": \"123456789\",\n\"account_postal_code\": \"10001\",\n\"account_country_code\": \"US\"\n}\nExample Response\nYou will receive a 302 response with a Location header. You must redirect your user to the URL from this header, which will land on a UPS sign-in screen.\nCopy\n1\n\"Location\": \"https://authbridge.auctane.com/authflow/ups/shipengine/initiate?callbackUrl=https...\"\nWe advise redirecting your user to this location URL in a pop-up window. When the user has signed in, they will land on a page that will direct them to close the window. At this point, your application should make a List Carrier call to retrieve the new list of connected carrier accounts.\nIf your UPS account was connected prior to June 3, 2024 you will need to reconnect it so that it can establish a connection with UPS' oauth API. Reconnection can take place in the ShipEngine dashboard, or via API. The contract for reconnection is identical to the contract for connection. Using Reconnect will allow you to keep the same carrier_id.\nExample Reconnect Call\nPUT /v1/connections/carriers/UPS/::carrier_id\nCopy\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\nPUT /v1/connections/carriers/ups/se-12345 HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.shipengine.com\nAPI-Key: __YOUR_API_KEY_HERE__\nContent-Type: application/json\n{\n\"nickname\": \"My UPS account\",\n\"account_number\": \"123456789\",\n\"account_postal_code\": \"10001\",\n\"account_country_code\": \"US\"\n}\nNOTE\nDisconnecting a Carrier\nSee the Disconnect section in our Delete a Carrier page for the process of deleting or disconnecting a carrier from ShipEngine.\nAdditional UPS Account Settings\nShipEngine takes advantage of some of UPS's advanced functionality but does not enable it by default. These settings can be updated in the Dashboard or via the API.\nTo update via the API, use the GET method with the carrier settings endpoint.\nParameter Type Description\nnickname string The display name assigned to the account.\nis_primary_account boolean Indicates the account is or is not the default account.\npickup_type enumerated string daily_pickup, occasional_pickup, customer_counter\nSee our Intro to Pickup Dropoff apge to learn more.\nuse_carbon_neutral_shipping_program boolean Adds a fee to the shipment to purchase carbon offset credits.\nuse_ground_freight_pricing boolean An advanced option available for certain UPS services.

Review the Parcel Insurance page for details on adding shipment insurance with ShipEngine.\nA few notes about adding insurance to UPS shipments:\nUPS covers the first $100 by default.\nInsurance >$100-$300 is an additional flat fee of $2.70.\nFor each additional $100, it's $0.90 per $100.\nTo prevent insurance claims for a higher value than a product is worth, UPS requires multiple forms of documentation and may contact you for confirmation.\nThe claims process begins when you report loss or damage to UPS, and then UPS will send you documentation and move on from there.\nIn the event of a high-value shipment, UPS will want to inspect it if declared as damaged and may take other measures.\nAdvanced Options\nUPS supports the following advanced options:\nDry Ice\nCollect on Delivery (C.O.D.)\nSaturday Delivery\nAdditional handling\nTo ensure you always have the most up-to-date information, use the List Carrier Advanced Options call.\nAdditional Carrier Details\nSupports scheduled pickups.

Of course, it\u2019s all fun and games until they get to the payment button and review the shipping costs.\nIf your shipping costs are too high, 43% of shoppers will abandon their carts, according to a study conducted by Comscore. That\u2019s too much revenue potential going down the drain. To avoid such pitfalls, you must find ways to reduce shipping costs to gain and retain e-shoppers in the hyper-competitive eCommerce space.\nHere are six tips you can apply to save on shipping costs.\nHow to Enhance Your Shipping Costs\nWhile you can\u2019t avoid eCommerce shipping costs altogether, you can cut back on your order delivery costs by following these tips:\n1. Fit Your Items Into the Right-Sized Packages\nUsing the right-sized packages has multiple benefits. Firstly, it reduces the cost and hassle of securing the product inside the box with cushioning material such as bubble wrap or styrofoam.\nWhen an item fits precisely in the package box, you\u2019ll use less filler material to cushion it from impact and restrict it from shuffling inside the box while in transit. This reduces your overall cost of packaging. You can use these cost savings to lower your shipping charges.\nSecondly, right-sized packages keep the dimensional weight of your packages at a minimum. For instance, if you sell smartphones but package them in TV-sized boxes, the dimensional weight will be higher even when the weight of the product is lower. In that case, you would pay unnecessarily high shipping rates.\nConversely, using the right-sized packages keeps your shipping charges at a fair minimum.\n2. Reduce Package Weight as Much as You Can\nThe heavier your packages are, the more shipping costs you or your customers will pay. Package weight is a significant price determinant, especially when you choose air freight because of weight limits. Because you can\u2019t reduce the actual weight of your products, your only solution is to use lightweight packaging materials.\nFortunately, there are many lightweight packaging materials to choose from, depending on the size and fragility of your items. These materials include:\nWater-activated tape (WAT)\nFoam inserts\nCorrugated boxes\nAstro foam\nAluminum composite panel\nBubble envelopes\nEco-Range Boxes\nWhen shipping heavy items such as gym equipment, you may want to disassemble them and place them in multiple packages for easier shipping. While that may not reduce your fulfillment costs, it\u2019ll ease handling and reduce the chances of freight damage.\n3. Calculate the Cost of Shipping Within Product Price\nAccording to Convey, 36% of eCommerce businesses are concerned about shipping costs and the growing consumer expectations about low-cost shipping or free delivery. Today\u2019s shoppers expect affordable shipping and will quickly exit your online store if you charge higher shipping rates.  \nThis becomes a dilemma for ecommerce retailers. On the one hand, you can\u2019t escape the rising shipping costs. On the other hand, you want to entice customers with free or low-cost shipping options and increase your Average Order Value (AOV) in the process. The best way to address this dilemma is by tweaking your pricing to include the shipping costs as part of the product price.\nThis way, your customers won\u2019t feel they are paying an extra premium for shipping. More importantly, it\u2019ll allow you to capitalize on the decoy effect brought about by the psychological appeal of free shipping.\n  4. Use a Flat-Rate Shipping Method Whenever You Can\nFlat-rate shipping is an excellent shipping strategy you can use to standardize your order delivery costs. With flat-rate shipping, your shipping charges are determined solely by the size of your package, not the dimensional weight of the product you\u2019re shipping. Additionally, flat-rate shipping saves you from peak season surcharges (PSS) that can eat into your profit margins when shipping during the holidays.\nOverall, flat rate shipping shields you from the cost variations caused by changes in dimensional weight, peak season surcharges, and shipping distance. In turn, you can protect your online shoppers from unexpected shipping costs.\n5. Compare Different Shipping Carrier Prices\nWith the many shipping carriers operating today, you have the liberty to compare shipping rates and choose the most affordable ones. You can leverage shipping comparison sites or an online shipping calculator to compare carrier prices and get the best deal. With the most affordable shipping solutions, you\u2019ll be better placed to pass down the cost benefits to your customers.\n6. Keep Track of Inflation, Freight Costs, and Other Variables\nLike any other economic activity, external factors affect shipping costs. These include:\nCustoms and duties\nTracking and insurance\nHandling costs\nEconomic factors such as inflation\nSocial factors such as insecurity or political instability in delivery locations\nYou must account for these and other relevant variables influencing shipping charges. Doing so shields you from unexpected losses. For instance, if you\u2019re shipping to customers in locations likely to experience violence, you may want to increase your tracking and insurance covers.\n7. Offer Local or Regional Delivery Services\nToday, 57% of Americans say they shop locally to support local businesses and keep money in their community. With local shopping, consumers expect expedited delivery time. You must optimize domestic shipping to satisfy consumer expectations and earn local customer loyalty.\nFortunately, local delivery isn\u2019t hard to execute successfully. You can hire a local fulfillment company to handle your order deliveries for a small fee or use in-house fulfillment by leveraging your existing staff.  If you have local supply chains, regional delivery can be super-convenient thanks to dropshipping.\nExceeding your customer\u2019s expectations with domestic shipping is efficient and resource-effective, so, as a savvy ecommerce retailer, you should hone in on your local delivery services to capitalize on the buy-local trend and expand your revenue margins.\nSave on Shipping Rates With Cart.com's Fulfillment Services\nAt Cart.com, we know firsthand the plight of online retailers losing chunks of their revenues to shipping costs.

They like a product, and the price is right \u2013 and then what? Conversion is also often dependent on shipping time and cost. A recent shipping survey found that shoppers overwhelmingly prefer free shipping to fast shipping but that 41% of consumers will pay shipping for a product they want, and 32% will proceed with an order if the cost is reasonable. Shipping costs require strategy \u2013 and the ability to calculate and estimate. If you don\u2019t optimize shipping costs for you and the customer, it can affect profits and growth. In this article, we\u2019ll walk you through the shipping process, strategies and how to calculate ecommerce shipping costs so you can make decisions that improve customer satisfaction without affecting your bottom line. \nFrom order to doorstep: What influences shipping costs\nShipping is a complex process with many components. Orders come in, are processed, picked and packed, labeled and shipped. Each of those steps precedes the actual shipping and shipping cost per order.\nSeveral factors influence the full cost of shipping a product:\nPackage dimensions and weight\nMajor carriers use a pricing calculation method called dimensional weight (DIM weight). It uses the size of your product \u2013 length x width x height \u2013 of the package or box size and divides it by a DIM divisor. However, if your package is heavy, weight will determine shipping. In other words, your package is evaluated by weight or dimensions, whichever affects the price more.\nDestination\nShipping zones are the geographical areas that carriers use to calculate shipping rates. They are used to determine shipping costs and delivery timeframes based on distance. A package traveling coast to coast will cost more than one traveling to the next zip code.\nDelivery timeframe\nCurrent customer demands for short (even same-day) deliveries add a layer of complexity for ecommerce businesses. Shipping costs are based on delivery timeframes as well. Something sent 2- or 3-day shipping versus economy will cost more. And yet, expedited shipping has become an expectation, with 62% of shoppers expecting orders to arrive in less than three business days.\nShipping insurance and package contents\nIf your product is high value, you might add insurance. Other types of content also affect pricing, such as if an item is fragile. Insurance protects these items against loss, theft and damage.\nUnexpected issues\nPackages in transit can be affected by things outside your control. Weather, accidents and other random occurrences can delay or prevent a delivery. Brands must budget for potential shipping issues to ensure the customer experience is positive by resolving any problems swiftly.\nHow to charge for shipping\nShipping expenses are something brands should monitor constantly. Keeping track allows you to assess losses incurred by shipping costs and make strategic, informed decisions to offset them, especially when offering free shipping or running shipping promotions.\nToday\u2019s retailers must offer affordable shipping rates and provide seamless shipping experiences to satisfy their customers \u2013 and there are ways to determine shipping costs strategically. You can:\n  Decide on a shipping price strategy. Will you:\nOffer free shipping?\nCharge flat rates?\nCharge case by case?\nOffer free shipping after a certain order amount?\nShip economy for free and charge for expedited?\nGive free shipping to loyalty members?\nHave shipping promotions during peak periods?\nCharge a customized rate for items with high DIM weights?\n  Determine speed and carrier. Will you:\nShip economy or expedited? Will you charge more for expedited?\nUse ground or air?\nUse a 3PL service for fulfillment and shipping?\n  Ways to reduce shipping costs\nFree shipping for all is a fantastic idea \u2013 but it\u2019s not reasonable for every ecommerce brand. Instead, look for ways to reduce shipping costs so you can pass on those savings to your customers. Some of the best places to find savings are:\nDecrease shipping distances\nYou instantly lower shipping costs when reducing the number of zones packages travel. You can do this using a multi-node fulfillment strategy, which allows you to distribute inventory nearer to customers. Multiple nodes can also shorten delivery timeframes, further improving the customer experience.\nOffer flat-rate shipping\nFlat-rate shipping charges a fixed shipping fee for the service if the item fits into the package dimensions provided. In addition, packing materials are often part of the shipping rate, making it a cost-effective option. A flat-rate shipping strategy can help you standardize costs, but it\u2019s crucial to assess whether it\u2019s a good fit given your current volume and product characteristics.\nReduce the weight and dimensions of your package\nAnalyzing your current packaging can help you find ways to reduce current dimensions and weight. For example, look for ways to rearrange, fold, flatten, vacuum seal or use custom-shaped packaging that minimizes the size. You can also reduce weight by using lighter-weight packing materials.\nConsolidate shipments\nAnytime you consolidate shipments or multiple orders, it may save you money. Sending an order in multiple shipments can cost more than just the shipping fee. You may also need to buy extra packaging materials for each shipment, which adds additional expenses. Customers often feel frustrated with split shipments, meaning you boost satisfaction when you consolidate as well.\nGet discounted shipping rates\nOften, there are perks to sending a high volume of packages. You can receive discounts by negotiating with carriers or utilizing their business solutions. Talking to different carriers is beneficial as well. Gathering information will allow you to make the best decision, even if it means moving to a competitor to save money.\nPartner with a 3PL\nFor many ecommerce brands, looking at fulfillment and shipping as symbiotic is beneficial. At a certain point, your inventory is offsite and you\u2019re have to manage a high volume of orders while shipping, tracking and replenishing stock.\nMany 3PL services have access to wholesale rates. This is an instant save on shipping costs. Additionally, a 3PL partner with multiple fulfillment centers offers shorter transit times, giving you the ability to reduce shipping timeframes.\nOptimize your shipping strategy with Cart.com\nShipping has become a critical part of the overall retail customer experience.

In this edition, we welcome Remington Tonar, Co-Founder and Chief Growth Officer at Cart.com. Join us as Remington discusses starting a company during the pandemic, building trust with customers, and reaching the lofty unicorn status. \nCompany Snapshot\nName: Cart.com\nHeadquarters: Houston\nYear founded: 2020\nNumber of Employees: 1,500\nCan you provide some basic information on your company?\nCart.com is a unified commerce and logistics company that leverages software, AI, and our network of fulfillment centers to solve the inventory, supply chain, and fulfillment challenges facing various industries.\nFor merchants, Cart.com offers commerce solutions that help efficiently manage, list, advertise, sell, and distribute products across channels. These solutions include software and software-enabled services, which include channel, order & inventory management software, marketplace services, and software-enabled fulfillment services.\nRemington Tonar\nWe support more than 6,000 D2C, B2C, and B2B companies and more than 75 million orders per year. Our customers include retailers like TOMS, PacSun, Draper James, and Janie and Jack as well as a range of public sector agencies and large enterprises requiring software-enabled inventory and order management, as well as logistics and fulfillment services.\nWhat inspired you to start this business, and what gap in the market are you trying to fill?\nAs e-commerce continued to grow in popularity, we saw a challenge that was increasingly difficult for retailers to solve: the operating environment for sellers was becoming more and more fragmented. It was becoming harder for brands to meet customers\u2019 demands across a growing number of digital and physical touchpoints.\nThis problem was particularly salient for our Founder and CEO, Omair Tariq, who was an executive at D2C retailer Blinds.com, which was acquired by The Home Depot where he went on to be a key member of the HomeDepot.com leadership team.  We set out to solve this commerce complexity by unifying the capabilities required to sell across channels seamlessly at scale. Cart.com\u2019s initial vision was to build a unified cart that enables customers to buy across channels seamlessly and allows sellers to cart products wherever they need to go efficiently. Following several strategic acquisitions, the company now offers a comprehensive set of pre and post-purchase software and services that allow merchants to unify, manage, and automate marketing, sales, and distribution channels to meet their customers wherever they are while scaling more profitably.\nCan you share your experience in obtaining funding for your venture?\nWhen we founded the company in late 2020, e-commerce was experiencing an incredible acceleration due to the pandemic. By the end of 2021, e-commerce sales were still pacing at 50% greater than the same period in 2019. So we saw incredible excitement from investors in our vision and the larger opportunity.\nIn the following years, the growth rate of e-commerce largely normalized and capital became more expensive. With that, we saw most investors shift their north star metric to profitability over growth. What makes Cart.com unique in this environment is that we\u2019ve been focused on delivering both since our inception.\nRelated News: Modex 2024 StartUp Award Winners Announced | Cart.com Unveils New AI-Powered Platform\nIn mid-2023, we announced a successful Series C fundraiser and reached unicorn status. By the end of the year, we not only grew revenue by 50%, but we also achieved sustainable profitability.  Still, the cautious capital environment has generally meant it is harder and takes longer to fundraise, even as a financially sound and growing company.\nCan you share any challenges that you had to overcome in building your business?\nLike any new startup entering a fairly established industry, we anticipated building trust with potential customers \u2013 particularly established, mature brands and large enterprises \u2013 would be a challenge.  We came to market with the big idea of connecting the entire commerce value chain, enabling retailers and enterprises to better connect their data and operations, consolidate vendors, and save money. The surprise was how quickly we were able to establish trust with some of the largest global brands and enterprises and scale our growth.\n\u201cWe came to market with the big idea of connecting the entire commerce value chain, enabling retailers and enterprises to better connect their data and operations, consolidate vendors, and save money. The surprise was how quickly we were able to establish trust with some of the largest global brands and enterprises and scale our growth.\u201d  \n  Our customers tell us this is a combination of both the strength of our innovation and technology as well as the strength of our leadership team, which includes a wide range of industry veterans and top operators with decades of experience in e-commerce and logistics. By bringing in that talent, we gained a global perspective on the key areas where technology could solve supply chain challenges, enabling us to build out an offering that delivers the performance and results our customers require to compete in a fiercely competitive and complex e-commerce landscape. As we\u2019ve built out our own track record of reliability and innovation, we\u2019ve been able to compete for and win bigger and bigger deals and are now proud to work with some of the most beloved retailers and most trusted enterprises in the industry. \nWhat's your approach to building a team and company culture?\nWe founded Cart.com during the pandemic, which meant that the company was remote-first from the beginning. So our first challenge was simply to build a sense of purpose and culture across an all-remote workforce. As we moved into 2021 and 2022, we acquired several companies that added hundreds of employees based all around the world. These companies all had their pre-existing histories and cultures that we then had to integrate and unite into one larger company.\nAt the same time, Cart.com was growing organically, which meant that we were hiring new employees across teams at an incredibly rapid pace. We believe all of these elements \u2013 intentional or not \u2013 helped us build the incredibly diverse workforce we have today. As a company working to unify the disparate and fragmented pieces of the commerce value chain for customers, having this diversity across backgrounds, skill sets, industries, functions,  and locations, helps us bring in different perspectives that ultimately help us serve our customers better.\nHow do you differentiate your product from competitors in the market?\nCart.com is the only major player unifying commerce across sales and distribution channels as well as across digital and physical capabilities. On the front end, our software helps merchants automate and manage listings across 2,000+ social and shopping channels as well as across all major marketplaces. We also offer white-glove services like growth marketing, marketplace optimization, and customer support for brands. On the back end, we operate 14 tech-enabled omnichannel fulfillment centers, helping brands pick, pack, ship, and store products for any channel. Our goal is to make it easier for brands to sell and fulfill products wherever their customers are while helping them drive more efficient growth.\nWhat does the future hold for Cart.com? \nWe're continuing to invest in software and capabilities that provide our customers with a robust, interconnected infrastructure that optimizes and orchestrates the digital and physical aspects of selling and fulfilling in a scalable and profitable way.\n\u201cOur goal is to make it easier for brands to sell and fulfill products wherever their customers are while helping them drive more efficient growth.\u201d\n  Last month, we announced the expanded availability of our proprietary AI-powered Order Management System, Constellation OMS, to customers outside our fulfillment network. Constellation OMS was built to help retailers unify order and inventory management, solve supply chain and fulfillment challenges, improve cost efficiency and drive growth.\nInventory and channel orchestration challenges have cost enterprises billions and slowed growth rates in recent years. We believe a unified order management system is key to winning in the omnichannel world and AI is the most powerful tool for navigating the current environment successfully - as long as it\u2019s connected across every touchpoint in a retailer's commerce value chain.\nAs we layer in more and more of these AI-backed capabilities, including Inventory and Demand Forecasting, we\u2019ll be able to take much of the guesswork out of product marketing and inventory management. We\u2019ve already seen that connecting marketing and order data can improve traditional forecasting by up to 55%. Our model takes a look at online and offline campaign metrics, social media trends, and ad spend efficiency to calculate the direct impact of marketing efforts on demand spikes and customer purchasing patterns down to the SKU level. We then combine that with historical order data to forecast future demand, which can better predict where you might have excess inventory or a stock out issue. Overall, this helps retailers increase advertising efficiency while also helping 3PLs have better insights for labor demand planning, which drives cost savings on both the pre-purchase and post-purchase sides of the business.\nWhat trends or changes do you foresee impacting your industry in the coming years?\nThere are two key trends \u2013 both of which point to a more unified commerce experience for merchants and customers \u2013 that we believe will have major impacts on the industry in the coming years. In the short term, consolidation is a big focus. We\u2019ve already seen the beginning of some M&A activity, but we are also hearing from companies looking to streamline the number of vendors they work with to drive cost savings and overall efficiency.\nDuring the pandemic, when capital was cheaper and growth was easier, you saw many brands follow a single-channel strategy. Post-pandemic, however, any brand (or vendor) that was overly reliant on any one channel has likely struggled to deliver growth and control their margins given competitive dynamics, pricing, advertising costs, and constantly evolving consumer shopping habits. Brands that will win in this environment understand that they have to diversify their channel mix to improve sales and margin, streamline the number of vendors they have supporting each channel to reduce costs and unify their data and operations across channels to achieve a complete picture of their business.\nIn the long term, the application of artificial intelligence across the commerce value chain will bring some exciting capabilities that enable merchants to work more efficiently and more accurately predict demand and in turn reduce costs. Among the things we\u2019re already working on at Cart.com: leveraging generative AI and LLMs to optimize and automate merchandising across thousands of direct and marketplace channels, applying machine learning to automate and synchronize repricing in real-time and using AI-powered demand forecasting that ingests data like marketing and sales history, seasonality, current ecommerce performance and projected marketing campaign activity to deliver a more accurate picture of demand down to the SKU level. \nBy focusing on unifying data and operations across these disparate channels and systems, brands ultimately benefit from better intelligence and more control \u2013 all while running a more efficient operation.\n  Get Supply Chain News Delivered\nGet supply chain, ware\u00adhouse and trans\u00adport\u00adation news de\u00adlivered direct to your in-box and learn about new tech\u00adnol\u00adogies and tech\u00adniques for improving your op\u00ader\u00adations.

Much more goes into shipping than simply getting the order from the warehouse to the customer\u2019s home. Shippers must take into account when the customer wants to receive their order, the packaging and, of course, the shipping costs. They must also keep up with the latest technologies and regulations in the constantly changing shipping industry. Case in point: dimensional (DIM) weight.\nA Closer Look at Dimensional (DIM) Weight\nIt\u2019s hard to believe, but DIM weight was first introduced to ground shipments only four years ago. Before then, shippers were simply charged for the weight of their shipment, no matter the size of the parcel. All of that changed when two of the largest carriers, FedEx and UPS, introduced DIM weight pricing for all ground shipments.\nAs many know, DIM weight is normally calculated for ground shipments by the length, width, and height of each parcel that is over three cubic feet, regardless of the shipment\u2019s weight. This was a big change for shippers in 2015, especially since many of them experienced significantly higher shipping costs \u2013 some as high as 30%. Unfortunately, these DIM weight rates are only continuing to increase each year, forcing many shippers to continue to find new ways to combat these higher shipping charges as to avoid impacting their bottom line.\nDownload eBook\nStrategies for Reducing Shipping Costs While Still Meeting Customer Demands\nFor this reason, shippers are constantly reviewing their shipping procedures and turning to different solutions and shipping strategies. By leveraging the following strategies, companies can exponentially reduce shipping costs while still meeting customer demands.\nRenegotiate shipping contracts with multiple carriers.\nBefore reaching out to your main shipping carriers to negotiate better rates and update contracts, obtain rates from all viable carriers. It may seem obvious, but knowing what company offers the lowest rate can help you negotiate with your current carriers, as well as update your contract. Your carrier is able to review the number of parcels your company shipped per day/month/year and the average parcel size so they can create a unique contract designed just for your business. This will dramatically save on shipping costs and help boost business.\nConsider a variety of carriers, including both regional and local.\nMany companies may not realize local couriers can transport shipments 80 to 100 miles within a specified zone. This is an excellent mode of transportation for last-mile delivery as it can provide a personalized, caring service for customers. Regional carriers also offer longer time schedules for pick-up and delivery, and they can even provide next-day delivery options to meet customer expectations. These carriers are especially beneficial for shippers as these services are oftentimes more cost-effective than large carriers, and not all utilize DIM weight surcharges.\nDesign packaging with DIM weight in mind.\nIt\u2019s no surprise DIM weight charges impact large lightweight items the most. However, all oversized parcels are losing shippers money. This is why it\u2019s critical shippers design packaging that better fits these items in order to create the smallest parcel possible.\nTo do this, shippers can begin stocking many different types of parcel sizes in order to create these custom-fit packages. However, some shippers have found this strategy is not always feasible due to warehouse space. In these cases, shippers incorporate automated packaging solutions into the order fulfillment process. These systems measure, construct, tape, weigh, and label each order while creating a fit-to-size package. These parcels can be created in as little as seven seconds using only one operator, which allows for better efficiencies. These systems can also auto-box thousands of single- or multi-item orders per day, creating fit-to-size parcels with the lowest DIM weight.\nRate shop carriers and services using multi-carrier shipping software.\nMany shippers turn to shipping software that automatically rate shops their carriers and services to identify the best shipping option for every order, no matter the DIM weight. These shippers have found they can save a minimum of six percent in shipping costs and have increased savings with many different regional carriers and services, even without established contracts. Rate shopping also provides shippers with increased negotiating powers when the time comes to renegotiate with their current carrier contracts.\nWhile DIM weight surcharges are a constant pain point for shippers, there are many strategies and solutions that can be incorporated into the fulfillment process that alleviate increased shipping costs. From updating contracts to utilizing multiple shipping carriers to new technologies, these solutions are easy to incorporate and can save you thousands. In the end, when the only constant in the shipping industry is change, shippers need to incorporate the best strategies and solutions into the warehouse in order to keep up with regulations and boost business.\nJustin Cramer is Head of Sales & Marketing and Co-Founder at ProShip, Inc, the global provider of today\u2019s #1 multi-carrier shipping software. Throughout his time at ProShip, Cramer has designed shipping solutions responsible for executing more than 1.1 million labels per day and has worked with many small to global shippers on achieving certified carrier labels.\nThis article originally appeared on pages 22-23 in the 2019 May/June issue of PARCEL.\nYou might also like...\nOn-Demand Webinar: Distributing Consumer Products in an E-Commerce World\neBook: Retailers Divulge Top 10 Carrier-Related Shipping Concerns\nBrochure: Advanced Date Shopping, a New Kind of Rate Shopping\nPREVIOUS RESOURCE\nThinking Outside the (Subscription) Box\nNEXT RESOURCE\nHow Two US Navy Nuclear Veterans Teamed Up to Create World-Class Shipping Software\nOTHER CONTENT IN THIS STREAM\nShow previous\nShow next\nWHITE PAPER\nThe ProShip Report 2024\nDive into this report that analyzes data from 209 high-volume parcel shippers to shed light on their fulfillment preferences, carrier selection criteria, and pressing operational concerns.\nVIEW RESOURCE\nPODCAST\n[ProShip ParcelCast] Episode 31: Peak Season Power Moves: Optimizing Your Carrier Strategy\nWe are less than 6 months away from peak season, a busy time filled with anticipation for both consumers and businesses alike.

At the same time, alternative order fulfillment strategies offer a profitable path to growth for many mall-based stores and commercial property owners.\nAlthough economic outlooks for 2023 fuel uncertainty, e-commerce continues to boost retail consumer spending. After the pandemic added an extra $213.5 billion in e-commerce sales during 2020-2021, e-commerce sales continue to increase, growing 10% in the third quarter of 2023 and making up 14.1% of total retail sales.\nMeanwhile, shopping center vacancy is at its lowest level since 2007, and last year\u2019s new real estate construction was down 80 percent compared to pre-pandemic. \nThat means opportunity exists for businesses that maximize their existing space while fulfilling the demand of online customers and a rebounding audience of in-store shoppers. As those consumers\u2019 service expectations increase, controlling last-mile delivery cost is essential to any retailer\u2019s growth equation. \nLet\u2019s examine last-mile delivery and why it is so important in the modern retail strategy. This blog also offers three methods to reduce last-mile delivery cost and support customer experience. \nLike other multichannel fulfillment strategies, retailers and commercial real estate owners can use ship-from-store (SFS), urban warehousing, and smart lockers to reduce retail supply chain expenses and drive revenue.\nWhat is Last-Mile Delivery?\nThe \u201clast mile\u201d in supply chain management is the final leg of a product\u2019s journey from a transportation hub, distribution center, or retail store to the final destination. That final destination can be a residential doorstep, a business location, or, increasingly, alternative pick-up locations, such as lockers or curbsides.\nLast-mile delivery focuses on executing that final product movement in ways that control costs and protect the buying experience for the end customer. For mall-based retailers, the last-mile delivery is the activity that puts the product in the hands or the home of the customer. The last mile can have a significant effect on a brand, too.\nThat\u2019s because 98% of consumers say last-mile delivery is essential for brand loyalty. Meanwhile, 76% of respondents in another recent survey said an unacceptable delivery experience would affect their decision to order from that company again.\nWhat Does Last-Mile Delivery Cost?\nIf those stakes aren\u2019t high enough, the last mile is the most expensive move in the supply chain \u2013 making up 53% of total transportation costs for all shippers. For many mall-based retailers, the cost impact is less, but at least half of those we surveyed say last-mile delivery is at least 40% of their total supply chain cost. \nConsumer expectations for delivery speed are a significant driver of last-mile costs. A Coresight Research survey found that 65% of mall-based retailers report that their customers expect delivery by the next day or better. Nearly 15% of retailers say their customers expect delivery within two hours. \nMeeting those customer expectations affects a retailer\u2019s bottom line. Failure to do so carries a cost to their brand identity. That\u2019s why many retailers are using mall-based fulfillment strategies to reduce last-mile delivery cost.\n3 Ways to Lower Last-Mile Delivery Cost and Enhance Customer Experience\nMall-based fulfillment options reduce shipping costs because they rely on inventory that is closer to customers. BOPIS (buy online, pickup in store), curbside pickup, and ship from store are strategies that retailers use to improve sales and profits. \nAt the same time, urban warehousing and smart lockers offer commercial property owners an opportunity to take advantage of consumers\u2019 demand for rapid delivery and flexible service. \nLet\u2019s examine the accessible benefits using three strategies: ship from store, urban warehousing, and smart lockers. All three offer retailers an opportunity to reduce last-mile delivery costs while meeting the delivery service expectations of their customers.\n1. Ship From Store (SFS)\nBy fulfilling orders using inventory in their mall-based stores, retailers can reduce last-mile delivery expenses and tap other ship-from-store benefits. That\u2019s because store locations are often closer to customer homes than out-of-town warehouses or distribution centers. \nIn the Coresight Research survey, we learned that 28.6% of retailers saved 8%-10% of total last-mile delivery costs by shipping from their mall-based stores. Another 31.4% reported saving 5%-8%.\nShip-from-store strategies allow retailers to use multiple stores as fulfillment centers, so they can identify the best product location to meet customers\u2019 delivery expectations. Likewise, retailers can avoid lost sales on out-of-stock products by filling orders from any location. \nHowever, ship from store comes with challenges, including training staff to pick, pack and ship customer orders. Balancing time between in-store selling and order fulfillment creates additional staff management challenges.\n2. Urban Warehousing\nMany traditional and online retailers are moving their warehouses into urban areas as part of an effort to put inventory closer to consumers and reduce the delivery time. There, warehousing, order-picking, and shipment execution facilitate same-day and next-day deliveries in densely populated areas.\nUsed in conjunction with a cloud-based warehouse management system, urban warehousing maximizes a retailer\u2019s storage capacity and ensures that the correct quantities of the right inventory are in the correct locations to meet customer demand.\n3. Smart Lockers\nSmart lockers are electronic storage solutions that enable retailers to store parcels for customer pick-up at convenient locations like store locations, shopping centers, public terminals, and residential areas. \nAgain, this strategy fulfills the goal of putting purchased products close to the consumer, reducing transportation costs, and limiting many last-mile challenges that often slow delivery.\nRetailers deliver orders to the lockers and notify customers when their purchase is ready for pick-up. Customers can access their purchase and the locker using various electronic means, such as scanning a barcode, RFID tag, or fingerprint. At the same time, retailers avoid missed deliveries, traffic congestion, and other delivery service disruptions, while consumers enjoy the convenience of product pick-up at a time of their choosing.\nLogistics as a Service Lowers Last-Mile Delivery Costs\nRetailers that rely on store-based fulfillment options like ship from store can quickly meet increasing consumer demand for fast delivery while reducing e-commerce costs. Likewise, smart lockers and urban warehousing allow mall-based retailers to move inventory closer to their customers and reduce delivery costs.\nStrategies like smart lockers and urban warehousing are not just for big-name retailers that can afford to build their own. By using a local market logistics provider, like Fillogic, retailers and digitally native brands can utilize Fillogic Hubs, located in premium shopping centers, to manage inventory, fulfillment, inbound optimization, reverse logistics, and middle- and last-mile delivery.

It's no secret that optimizing your shipping strategy is crucial in today's competitive landscape. But let's face it, between coordinating with multiple carriers, managing rising costs, and ensuring timely deliveries, it can feel like a downright nightmare. So, let's dive into some handy tips to help you get a grip on your shipping strategy and keep your profits intact.\nTip 1: Offer a variety of shipping options\nThe saying \"different strokes for different folks\" couldn't be more accurate when it comes to shipping options. Customers have diverse preferences, and offering a range of shipping choices can help cater to their individual needs. In fact, a UPS survey found that 50% of online shoppers have abandoned a purchase due to unsatisfactory shipping options. Plus, striking a balance between shipping speed and cost can make all the difference in customer satisfaction and, ultimately, help you reduce shipping costs.\nOffering multiple shipping options allows you to take advantage of different carriers' pricing structures and special deals. For instance, some carriers may have lower rates for specific package sizes or weights, while others might offer better prices for certain destinations. By giving your customers a variety of choices, you can optimize your shipping costs based on the best carrier rates for each package. And don't forget the importance of address verification, tracking, and notifications, which can help you avoid costly errors and keep customers informed.\nTip 2: Keep an eye on surcharges and hidden fees\nLet's be honest, nobody likes unpleasant surprises, especially when it comes to shipping costs. Additional carrier fees, surcharges, and hidden costs can add up quickly, eating into your profits. To keep these sneaky expenses in check, it's essential to stay vigilant and actively track all charges.\nOne way to minimize surcharges is by investing time in negotiating better rates with carriers. You might be surprised at the savings you can achieve with a little haggling. Additionally, leveraging automated customs forms and compliance tools can help streamline the process and ensure that you're meeting all the necessary regulations. \nTip 3: Optimize packaging to minimize costs\nIt's a delicate dance, finding the perfect balance between packaging quality and cost. But getting it right can significantly impact your shipping costs. In fact, a recent study found that businesses could save up to 20% on shipping costs simply by optimizing packaging materials and size. \nSo how do you get started? Consider using custom packaging that fits your products like a glove. Not only does this look more professional, but it also helps you save on dimensional weight pricing \u2013 a pricing model that considers both the size and weight of a package. By optimizing your packaging, you can avoid paying for unnecessary space while ensuring your products reach their destination safely. Emphasizing dimensional rate flexibility, you can capitalize on the best carrier rates for your unique packages. \nTip 4: Implement a multi-carrier strategy\nPutting all your eggs in one basket may not be the wisest move when it comes to carriers. Working with multiple carriers offers several advantages, including mitigating risks and ensuring timely deliveries, even when a specific carrier faces delays or issues.\nA multi-carrier approach also allows you to leverage the benefits of dynamic time-in-transit rate shopping. By using AI-powered analytic tools, you can compare rates and delivery times for different carriers, selecting the best option for each shipment. According to a report by Parcel Magazine, businesses utilizing a multi-carrier strategy saved an average of 8-10% on shipping costs. Those are numbers that can really add up over time!\nTip 5: Leverage modern shipping software and technology\nOld-school shipping methods just don't cut it anymore. Modern shipping solutions offer a host of advantages, including streamlining processes and improving efficiency. Having the right tech stack can help you navigate the complexities of shipping with ease. Moreover, detailed analytics provided by AI-powered tools allow you to strategically select the most cost-effective carriers or identify the shortest routes. By embracing technology, you can future-proof your shipping operations and ensure you stay ahead of the competition.\nTip 6: Embrace automation for seamless shipping processes\nIn the fast-paced world of shipping, time is money. Automation can save both. By automating various aspects of your shipping processes, such as label printing, tracking notifications, and insurance, you can significantly streamline your operations and reduce the likelihood of errors.\nInvesting in automated systems also simplifies compliance with customs forms and other regulations, ensuring your shipments are always in line with the latest requirements. As global trade compliance expert Karen E. Purdy emphasizes, \"Automation in the trade compliance field is a must to stay ahead of the game and ensure that your company is meeting its regulatory obligations.\"\nTip 7: Choose the right shipping partners\nLast but certainly not least, selecting the right shipping partners is crucial for optimizing your shipping strategy. After all, you're entrusting them with your precious cargo and customer satisfaction. Look for partners that provide a wide network of carrier options and have algorithms in place to help you find the best combination of price and service for each package.\nAdditionally, it's essential to have partners that integrate seamlessly with your existing shipping platforms, making the transition as smooth as possible. And let's not forget about world-class customer support \u2013 because when issues do arise, you want to know there's someone you can rely on to help you sort things out.\nOptimizing your shipping strategy doesn't have to be a Herculean task. By following these tips \u2013 offering a variety of shipping options, keeping an eye on surcharges, optimizing packaging, implementing a multi-carrier strategy, utilizing shipping software, embracing automation, and choosing the right shipping partners \u2013 you can take control of your shipping costs and keep your profits healthy. So go forth and conquer the shipping world, one package at a time!\n\u200d\nWritten by Lori Boyer \u2013 For nearly 15 years, Lori Boyer has been passionate about ensuring businesses have the content and education they need to be successful in the shipping world and beyond.

Shipping heavy items is costly due to high fees and surcharges. To save money, businesses must consider cost-effective solutions. Shipping heavy items poses unique challenges, including cost, capacity constraints, packaging, handling, storage and insurance. Shipping costs depend on weight, dimensions, distance and speed. Continue reading...\nUndoubtedly, the e-commerce industry has witnessed exponential growth in recent years, propelled by advancements in technology and changing consumer preferences. According to Statista, retail e-commerce sales surpassed 5.7 trillion US dollars globally in 2022 and are expected to reach over $8 trillion by 2027. Although e-commerce is an indispensable part of almost every retail business, it comes with unique challenges, especially when shipping heavy items.\nFor e-commerce businesses selling heavy products, shipping can be quite expensive, given the exorbitant fees and surcharges associated with handling such goods. Fortunately, there are numerous strategies for your business to save money when shipping these items. The e-commerce logistics experts at FirstMile provide a comprehensive guide on the most cost-effective way to ship heavy items.  \nWhat qualifies as heavy items in the shipping industry?\nFor most carriers, any parcel weighing over 70 lbs is considered a heavy shipment. Typically, very heavy items that weigh over 150 pounds are known as freight. Most shipping carriers calculate shipping costs based on both the weight and dimension of the box, referred to as DIM weight. The DIM weight is calculated by multiplying the package height x length x width, then dividing it by the carrier's DIM factor. As such, heavy or oversized items tend to cost more to ship than lighter goods. In addition to DIM weight, carriers may also add a large package surcharge if your package exceeds a certain weight or size threshold.\nCommon challenges that businesses face when shipping heavy items\nAs mentioned earlier, shipping heavy items comes with unique challenges that companies must tackle. These include:\nThe cost: Since shipping is based on weight, shipping heavy items can be expensive due to their weight and size. Unless carefully managed, the cost of shipping such items can quickly eat into your bottom line. There is a need to choose cost-effective solutions to save business expenses and maintain profitability.\nCapacity constraints: One of the primary challenges in shipping heavy items is finding carriers with the capacity to handle them. If a carrier doesn't have the necessary equipment or space, it can lead to delays as you may need to wait until they have room on their trucks or vessels.\nPackaging: Heavy items require sturdy packaging to prevent damage during transit. Finding appropriate packaging materials that can withstand the weight and protect the item can be a challenge.\nHandling: Heavy items may require special equipment and intricate procedures, especially during loading and unloading. Investing in the necessary resources and trained personnel to handle heavy items safely is essential.\nStorage: Heavy items often occupy significant space in warehouses or storage facilities. Properly organizing and storing these items can be challenging, especially if space is limited.\nInsurance: Shipping heavy items increases the risk of damage or loss during transit. Businesses need to consider adequate insurance coverage to protect against these risks. Ultimately, this will drive business costs further.\nDelays: Heavy items often require specialized handling and transportation, which can lead to delays in the shipping process. Weather conditions, traffic congestion, and unexpected logistical issues can further exacerbate these delays. It is worth mentioning that delays can adversely impact customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.\nFactors Affecting Shipping Costs\nHere are some of the factors to keep in mind when calculating shipping costs:\nWeight and dimensions\nAs mentioned earlier, carriers charge your shipment based on the actual weight and dimensions weight. Generally, weight-based pricing is straightforward, as it assumes that the heavier the package, the higher the shipping cost. On the other hand, dimensional weight pricing is determined by the box's length, height, and weight. It appreciates the fact that although the package might be light, it may take up a considerable amount of truck floor and wall space. This is why, as a business, you must choose your packaging boxes carefully. Opting for the smallest reasonable packaging material for your item can help you save on transportation and packaging materials costs. Here is a practical example to illustrate the correlation between weight and shipment cost:\nIf you are shipping an item whose actual weight is 41 lbs and DIM weight is 30 lbs, you will be charged for shipping 71 lbs. Now, assuming you are using UPS overnight delivery, you will pay between $177.58 and $225.24 to ship your package, depending on the specific package you choose.  \nDistances\nThe distance to the final destination is another crucial factor determining the overall cost of shipping. Generally, the greater the distance, the higher the shipping cost since more resources and time are required for transportation. As such, carriers often incur additional costs for fuel to cover longer distances. Longer distances also increase the depreciation of the vehicle, the number of handling operations, and delivery costs. These factors can increase requirements and costs associated with global shipping. Compared to domestic shipping, international shipping involves additional complexities and costs related to customs clearance, transportation modes, regulations, and documentation. As an e-commerce business, you must consider these factors carefully when planning international shipments and budgeting for shipping expenses.\nDelivery speed\nThe delivery speed is another factor that affects the cost of shipping heavy items. Typically, the quicker you need your package delivered, the more expensive shipping becomes. Urgent shipping often requires dedicated resources, streamlined processes, and deviations from standard routes or modes of transportation. Such maneuvers incur additional expenses, including expedited handling fees, premium transportation charges, and priority processing costs. Here is a real-world scenario showcasing different delivery timelines and their cost differentials for USPS:\nPriority Mail (1-3 days): Priority Mail takes between one and three days. Prices range from $6.95 for the small envelope to $17.60 for the large box. This can be an ideal option for small to medium-sized heavy items with no big rush to get to the customer.\nPriority Mail Express (overnight): This overnight shipment gets your package to its destination as quickly as possible. Items weighing less than 70 pounds start at $22.50. However, this rate applies specifically to flat-rate shipping envelopes, and costs may increase for other packaging options. This can be the cheapest option if your heavy item can be squeezed into the flat-rate envelope.\nMedia Mail (2 to 10 days): Media Mail gets your package to the customer in 2 to 10 days. It is the smallest niche for this carrier, ideal for any kind of media, such as books, CDs, and DVDs. Media Mail costs range from\nPackaging material\nPacking materials can also contribute to the overall cost of shipping. Studies reveal retailers in the US spend up to 10% on packaging compared to what they spend on the actual item. To minimize these costs, consider choosing purposeful packaging. This strategy entails selecting materials and designs that protect the contents during transit, optimize space utilization, and reduce excess weight. Choosing lightweight yet durable options can reduce shipping expenses without compromising product safety. You can also customize the packaging to fit the specific dimensions of the products being shipped. This eliminates unnecessary space within shipping boxes, thereby reducing the volume and weight of shipments.\nOverview of major shipping carriers\nA carrier is an entity that transports goods around the country or internationally. They have the assets, experiences, and skills necessary to move goods around the globe. These may include trucks, trains, planes, ships, personnel, and equipment dedicated to the shipment. Some of the leading carriers include:\nUPS: Founded in 1907, UPS is renowned for its extensive network and comprehensive range of shipping solutions. With operations spanning over 220 countries and territories, UPS offers diverse services, including express delivery, freight forwarding, logistics management, and supply chain solutions. Its commitment to innovation, sustainability, and customer satisfaction has solidified its position as a leader in the industry. UPS considers items over 70lbs as heavy. The company requires clients to attach a heavy sticker to all packages weighing more than 70 lbs. If your package weighs over 150 lbs, you must ship it through UPS Freight. UPS freight costs depend on whether you need ground or air freight. You may need to pay additional charges for value-added services, including lift-gate, limited access, and extreme length.\nFedEx: Established in 1971 and based in Memphis, Tennessee, FedEx has revolutionized the shipping industry with its pioneering overnight delivery service. The company operates a vast fleet of aircraft and vehicles, enabling swift and efficient transportation of packages and freight. FedEx provides various shipping options, including express delivery, ground shipping, freight services, and e-commerce solutions. With a global presence and a focus on technology-driven logistics, FedEx continues to set benchmarks for speed, reliability, and convenience in shipping. FedEx has a dedicated service for shipping heavy items weighing over 150 lbs, known as FedEx Freight shipping.\nDHL: As one of the world's largest logistics companies, DHL offers a comprehensive range of services encompassing express delivery, freight transportation, supply chain management, and e-commerce solutions. Headquartered in Bonn, Germany, DHL operates in more than 220 countries and territories, providing businesses and individuals with seamless shipping options tailored to their needs. DHL's commitment to innovation, sustainability, and customer-centricity has earned it a reputation as a trusted partner for global shipping and logistics solutions. The company offers a heavy shipment service called the DHL Express' Heavy Shipment Service, dedicated to heavy items weighing up to 3,000kg.\nFirstMile: Recognized for its focus on last-mile delivery solutions, FirstMile specializes in bridging the gap between businesses and consumers by offering efficient, cost-effective shipping services.

FirstMile has dedicated freight shipping service for packages weighing over 150 pounds or large boxes, ensuring efficient shipping.\nComparative analysis of carrier rates\nLeading carriers such as USPS, FedEx, and UPS offer competitive services for heavy packages. It is essential to note USPS has a weight limit of 70 pounds for shipping through its services. This makes UPS and FedEx ideal for heavy packages. Let's compare the cost of shipping a 71 pound between UPS and FedEx:\nOvernight/next-day delivery: It will cost you between $177.58 and $225.24 to ship an item weighing 71 pounds with UPS service. You will pay between $33.87 and $68.04 to ship the same item with FedEx service. Choosing FedEx over UPS could result in savings of up to 84.93%.\n2nd-day delivery: It will cost you between $121.38 and $ $133.56 to ship an item weighing 71 pounds with UPS service. You will pay between $22.59 and $25.37 to ship the same item with FedEx service. Choosing FedEx over UPS, you would save approximately 81.21% on shipping costs.\nGround delivery: It will cost you between $29.40 to ship an item weighing 71 pounds with UPS service. You will pay $10.10 to ship the same item with FedEx service. If you choose FedEx over UPS, you would save approximately 65.5%.\nAdditional costs and considerations\nApart from the carrier rates, there are additional costs to consider. These include:\nInsurance\nHeavy items often come with a higher risk of damage and loss during transportation. Insurance provides coverage against these risks, ensuring businesses don't suffer financially if their items are damaged or lost in transit. In addition to protecting the items themselves, insurance also provides liability coverage in case the heavy items cause harm or damage to third parties. This protects businesses from legal expenses and compensation costs from accidents or incidents involving heavy items. Besides, many industries and jurisdictions have regulatory requirements mandating businesses to have insurance coverage for heavy items. Failing to comply with these requirements can result in fines or legal consequences, highlighting the necessity of insurance.\nTracking services\nYou should also consider the cost of tracking services related to the shipment of your heavy goods. A study by McKinsey reveals incorporating tracking technology in shipping operations can reduce customer complaints by 90%. The right tracking solutions allow you to monitor the movement and location of your shipments in real-time. You can quickly identify any deviations from the planned route, enabling immediate action in case of potential risks or delays. Besides, having detailed insights into the whereabouts of your shipments ensures increased visibility and control over your supply chain operations. Such visibility allows you to proactively manage risks and optimize your logistics processes for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\nHandling and other fees\nWhen shipping heavy items, several potential hidden fees can significantly impact the total shipping cost. It is crucial to be aware of these charges to avoid surprises and accurately budget your shipment. Here is a checklist of standard extra charges to look out for:\nResidential delivery surcharge: If the shipment is delivered to a residential address rather than a commercial one, carriers may apply an additional fee.\nLiftgate service fees: If the pickup or delivery location lacks a loading dock or forklift, a liftgate may be required to load or unload the shipment. Carriers typically charge extra for this service.\nLimited access fees: Locations that are difficult to access, such as rural areas or construction sites, may incur additional charges.\nInside delivery charges: Carriers may assess an inside delivery fee if the shipment needs to be delivered beyond the front entrance, such as inside a building or up flights of stairs.\nRedelivery fees: Redelivery attempts may result in extra charges if the recipient cannot receive the shipment during the scheduled delivery window.\nReconsignment or rerouting fees: Changing the delivery address after the shipment is in transit can lead to consignment or rerouting fees.\nFuel surcharge: Carriers may apply a fuel surcharge to compensate for fluctuations in fuel prices.\nCustoms fees and duties: When shipping internationally, customs fees, import duties, and taxes may apply, significantly increasing the overall cost.\nPalletization fees: Carriers may charge extra for this service if your heavy items need to be palletized for shipment.\nTips for reducing shipping costs\nWith shipping costs based on weight and dimension, it can be quite expensive for e-commerce businesses to ship heavy and oversized packages. To reduce weight, you need to adopt the right cost-effective shipping strategies. Here are some of the tips to minimize your shipping costs.\nPackaging strategies\nThe right packaging method seeks to protect the item and reduce size-related costs. Experts recommend that you choose packaging materials tailored to the size of the item being shipped. Since the price is based on DIM, avoid excessive packaging that increases the weight and costs. Lightweight materials such as corrugated cardboard or recyclable plastics can offer sufficient protection without adding unnecessary weight. Consider also using custom foam inserts, corrugated cardboard dividers, or inflatable air cushions to safeguard fragile items and minimize excess packaging material. Some of the other best practices for packaging heavy items for transport include:\nUse secure cushioning: Use ample cushioning materials such as foam inserts, bubble wrap, or air pillows to protect heavy items from shocks and vibrations during transport. Ensure that the cushioning is tightly secured to prevent shifting.\nDistribute the weight: Distribute the weight evenly within the packaging to maintain stability and prevent strain on the container. Place heavier items at the bottom and distribute lighter items strategically to balance the load.\nUse sturdy sealing: Seal packaging securely using heavy-duty tape or strapping to prevent accidental opening or shifting of contents. Reinforce seams and edges to withstand the weight of the package.\nProvide handling instructions: Clearly label packages containing heavy items with handling instructions such as \"Team Lift\" or \"Fragile Heavy\" to alert handlers to exercise caution during transport. Provide proper training to personnel handling heavy packages to minimize the risk of accidents.\nComply with regulations: Ensure compliance with relevant rules and guidelines for transporting heavy items, including weight restrictions, labeling requirements, and safety standards. Failure to comply can result in delays, fines, or item damage.\nConsolidate shipments\nConsolidated shipping involves combining multiple orders into one shipment. One of the most significant benefits of this approach is cost savings. Carriers often offer discounts for larger shipments because it is more cost-effective for them to transport one large shipment than several smaller ones. Consolidating multiple heavy items into a single shipment allows you to take advantage of these volume discounts and reduce the per-unit shipping cost. Besides, bundling your shipments together can reduce handling and administrative costs. It allows you to streamline logistics, reduce labor costs and minimize administrative overhead. Here are some consolidated shipping strategies to help you optimize efficiency and cost savings:\nGeographical consolidation: With geographical consolidation, the business groups shipments based on proximity. By doing so, you minimize the distances and time needed for transportation. For instance, if you have several customers within the same region, you can group their shipments into a single load. This will save you the cost of long-haul transportation.\nVendor consolidation: This involves combining shipments from the same supplier or vendor. This strategy allows you to optimize the procurement process and negotiate better terms with the vendors.\nMode of transport consolidation: This strategy involves combining shipments using the same transportation mode, such as rail or truck. Grouping the consignment allows you to maximize cargo space within one transportation mode.\nContainer or pallet consolidation: This method maximizes space with the containers or pallets. The approach involves arranging items to minimize space within the storage units.\nTime-based consolidation: Time-based consolidation is where orders for specific days or times are batched together, leading to more efficient delivery routes. In a nutshell, this strategy seeks to group shipments together based on their delivery schedules.\nTechnology-driven consolidation: This strategy leverages advanced software and data analysis to make informed consolidation decisions. It utilizes algorithms and data-driven insights to identify the most cost-effective way to combine shipments.\nNegotiate rates\nAnother effective way to control shipping costs is to negotiate with your carrier for more favorable terms. Before you sit down with your preferred carrier, research rates for alternative shippers. Knowing the carrier's competition firsthand makes you more likely to earn concessions during negotiations. The carrier may be obliged to reduce some fees if they think you might shift to their competitor. Remember to negotiate with your carrier before finalizing any long-term shipping contracts. This allows you to explore multiple options and secure the best rates. Where possible, take advantage of seasonal fluctuations in demand and capacity to initiate the negotiation. Carriers are more willing to negotiate during slower periods with excess capacity. Here are a few quick tips for dealing successfully with better shipping rates:\nKnow your shipping volume: Clearly understand your shipping volume and frequency. Carriers are more likely to offer favorable rates to high-volume shippers.\nUnderstand market rates: Research prevailing market rates for shipping heavy goods. This information provides negotiation leverage and ensures you're getting a competitive deal.\nEmphasize long-term partnership: Highlight the potential for long-term cooperation. Carriers are often more inclined to offer discounts and preferential treatment to reliable, repeat customers.\nSeek multiple quotes: Obtain quotes from various carriers and use them as leverage to negotiate better rates.\nAlternative shipping\nThe following are some other cost-effective shipping options for your heavy items.\nFreight shipping\nFreight shipping can be an attractive option for transporting extremely heavy or large items due to its ability to handle oversized cargo efficiently. Freight carriers typically have larger vehicles and equipment designed to accommodate heavy and oversized items and optimize space, translating to lower shipping costs. Compared to parcel carriers that charge based on weight, dimensions, and distance, freight carriers typically offer volume-based pricing, which can be more cost-effective for heavy or oversized shipments. However, one drawback to freight shipping is the delivery time. Freight shipments often follow less direct routes, especially for international or long-distance transport, which can increase transit times. On the other hand, parcel carriers prioritize smaller packages and expedited services, offering faster delivery options compared to the often more scheduled nature of freight shipping.\nLocal delivery services\nYou can also consider a partnership with local delivery companies, especially when shipping to short distances. Smaller, localized carriers often have lower overhead costs than larger delivery companies. Ultimately, this often translates to lower delivery fees for customers. Besides, compared with large shipping companies, local carriers offer quicker delivery times since they are familiar with the area and can navigate it more efficiently. However, local delivery services have unique drawbacks worth considering. First, local carriers may need more coverage areas, which could restrict their ability to serve customers outside of specific regions. They may also lack the capacity to handle large deliveries, especially during peak times or busy seasons.\nLower the cost of shipping heavy items with FirstMile\nShipping large or heavy goods is challenging for most e-commerce businesses. Since shipping costs are primarily based on weight and dimension, sending heavy packages can be quite costly for the SMEs. To save costs and enhance efficiency, businesses must optimize their packaging and explore alternative shipping methods, such as freight shipping and local delivery services. Additionally, utilizing advanced technology and negotiating favorable rates with shipping carriers can further streamline the process and reduce expenses.\nUndoubtedly, the best strategy to reduce shipping costs for heavy items is to work with the pros.

According to Hanrahan, \u201cOne company with a large retail distribution operation estimates they will save over $300,000 in shipping costs by using our new cartonization software.\u201d\nBin Modeling vs Fluid Modeling Cartonization Logic \u2014 Most legacy cartonization software is based on the fluid model, which simply adds up the item volumes and compares the sum to the total volume of the carton. \u201cThis software model typically requires specific rules for some SKUs so it requires higher software support and customization to produce reasonable results,\u201d said Hanrahan. \u201cFor example, setting the fill factor too high will yield inaccurate cartonization results and expensive extra steps in the pick-and-pack process.\u201d\nNumina\u2019s new cartonization software is based instead on an advanced bin modeling algorithm that eliminates these limitations. It produces only SKU selection results that can truly fit into the selected carton size. It also much more closely achieves 100% fill ratios than fluid modeling solutions. The software can perform cartonization over any set of available containers and will optimize the total number and size of cartons to minimize shipping costs.\nBuilt-in Real-time Order and Shipment Validation \u2014 In addition to its \u201cpick to carton\u201d capabilities with built-in SKU and count validation, Numina\u2019s software also works well to monitor planned versus actual dimensional weights on outbound shipments, and detect discrepancies due to pick errors or SKU changes. The software can be integrated with an in-line weighing and dimensioning system to verify expected carton size and weight as shipping cartons travel to the pack lines for document insertion, void fill and taping. This method can be used for split case picks and is extremely valuable for verifying full case picking.\nAccurate Shipping Costs Pre-shipment \u2014 Numina\u2019s cartonization software, when integrated with an order fulfillment system, delivers real-time order inspection and results in more accurate LTL and parcel shipping costs. Shipping cost calculations are based on actual dimensional weight measurements, eliminating the risk of expensive charge backs or lost revenue.\nThe Numina Group is one of a handful of suppliers with both cartonization software for pick to carton and carton cube/weight measurement combined with real-time control and conveyor sorting decisions. \u201cOur software, integrated with existing ERP and/or WMS systems, can improve accuracy and reduce labor and shipping costs in existing or new DC operations,\u201d said Hanrahan.\nFull Case Pick Validation Catches Miss-picks \u2014 Companies that ship a high percentage of full-case SKUs can use the software\u2019s \u201clearn mode\u201d to on-line capture and learn full case SKU cube and weight. This eliminates the labor-intensive tasks of manual dimensional weight data collection. Additionally, once the SKU characteristics are learned, the software performs pick validation and can catch miss-picks in orders. This data can also be used to manage print and apply labeling of carrier or retail compliance shipping labels and improve other operations such as staging, storage space planning and cubing trailers for LTL or full truckload shipments.\n\u201cThe storage and cube utilization of a warehouse, the sizing of future facilities and transportation planning can all be optimized by combining cartonization software with an in-line dimensional weight system,\u201d said Hanrahan.\nCONTACT US\nLearn More:\nLearn More\nSet up a Complimentary Consultation\nThe Impact of Missing a Cut-Off Window in Distribution and How Numina Group Can Help\nREAD MORE\nNovember 15, 2024\nWhy AMR Cart Payload Capacity Matters in Warehouse Operations\nREAD MORE\nOctober 14, 2024\nHow Overtime & Temporary Staff Costs Hurt Distribution Centers\u2014and How Numina Can Help\nREAD MORE\nOctober 11, 2024\nThe High Cost of Shipping Mistakes and the Path to Perfect Order Practices\nREAD MORE\nOctober 4, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Numina Group\n10331 Werch Drive\nWoodridge, IL 60517\n630-343-2600\nProducts\nWarehouse Design Services\nWarehouse Control System Software\nVoice Picking System\nX-Press PAL\u2122 Print and Apply Labeling\nResources\nVideos\nNews\nEvents\nProduct Datasheets\nWhitepapers\nCareers\nAbout Us\nNumina Blog\nSupport\nContact Us\nCopyright \u00a9 2001-2024 by Numina Group, Incorporated\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nDisclaimers"

Small parcel shipping refers to the delivery service of small, lightweight parcels or packages that typically weigh less than 70 pounds but, depending upon the carrier\u2019s service offerings, may weigh up to 150 pounds.\nSmall parcel shipping comprises a large percentage of e-commerce and omnichannel B2B and B2C deliveries. The process of picking, packing, and shipping parcel shipments can be labor-intensive in manual fulfillment operations but can be efficiently managed by an automated warehouse system.\nParcel Shipment Packaging\nParcel shipment packaging types include cardboard boxes, envelopes, and soft pouches. The shipper usually provides the packaging for small parcel shipping, although the carrier may offer it. For example, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) provides a range of small USPS-branded boxes and pouches in multiple sizes to shippers at no cost. If the shipper provides the packaging, it must meet specific requirements, such as weight and size limits and other requirements defined by each carrier.\nBlog: How to Automate Pack and Ship Labeling Operations\nParcel Shipping Services\nSmall parcel shipping services are offered by a range of global, national, regional, and local carriers, including the United States Postal Service) UPS, FedEx, or DHL. Parcel delivery services include a broad range of service levels, such as standard ground, two-day, next, and same-day delivery.\nAdditional services include insurance, package tracking, and other accessorial services. The cost of shipping a parcel depends on factors such as the dimensions and weight of the parcel, the distance it needs to travel from the origin point to the delivery point, the required delivery date, etc.\nParcel shipments are not typically palletized, although in cases where a company is shipping large enough volumes of identical goods to a single destination, it may be possible to consolidate them onto a pallet and them via freight for a more economical cost.\nParcel Shipping Compared to Freight Shipping\nPackage delivery differs from freight shipping in the following ways.\nParcel Shipping\nParcel shipping is a service offered by numerous commercial carriers such as USPS, UPS, FedEx, and DHL. Small packages, such as parcels, are the main contents of a package truck, which may contain anywhere between 50 and 100 parcels, depending on the average package size. Examples include direct-to-consumer orders, e-commerce shipments, and documents.\nA parcel delivery truck follows a delivery route that includes multiple daily stops, delivering orders to residential and business locations.\nRates are based on package weight dimensions, delivery requirements, and additional services.\nThe orders carried are typically less than 150 pounds.\nThe trucks are usually no longer than 28 feet.\nFreight Shipping\nFreight shipments are delivered by numerous commercial freight carriers such as Yellow, ABF, and Pilot.\nFreight shipments may be a single stop, from point A to point B, or as part of a multi-stop shipment.\nFreight shipments are generally large loads, such as multiple products or orders consolidated and palletized on freight pallets. Examples include large industrial products, wholesale deliveries such as consolidated large furniture shipments to a retail store, and bulk products such as chemicals.\nFreight shipments may be less-than-truckload (LTL) or full-truckload (TL) orders.\nLTL freight rates are based on weight, dimensions, distance traveled, and additional services. TL rates are based on mileage.\nA typical large haul freight shipment can weigh from 5,000 to 70,000 pounds.\nOversized loads can weigh well over 110,000 pounds.\nParcel and freight-based shipping modes are important for omnichannel order fulfillment operations companies. One best practice to maximize pick, pack, and ship efficiency and ensure lowest cost shipping on all orders is to integrate a multi-modal shipping system into your overall automated warehouse platform.\nLearn More\nNumina Group\u2019s RDS\u2122 is a modular and scalable software suite for warehouse automation software solutions optimized to streamline the entire pick, pack, and ship order fulfillment operation.

                "text": "The OneRail Industry Insights Blog\nThe Shipper\u2019s Competitive Advantage of Delivery Speed to Market\nWRITTEN BY LIZ HAWKINS TAHAWI POSTED ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2022\nSpeed to market got a kick in the pants in 2020. Shippers had to balance a dramatic rise in orders, and consumer demand for on-time and quick delivery and fulfill these orders with fewer workers. But even during a normal year, parcel delivery can go awry. 3PLs and other delivery companies employed to transport goods could encounter problems, either on their end or with the end consumer. And when that does happen, it\u2019s bad news for a shipper\u2019s profitability.\nAs the logistics industry continues to evolve towards the consumer preference for online shopping, parcel deliveries are becoming increasingly outsourced to last mile specialists. The last mile market could reach $51 billion by the end of this year, up from $35.3 billion in 2019. And the 3PL market is on track to hit $1.7 trillion by 2026, registering 8% annual growth between 2021 and 2026.\nDemand for logistics services isn\u2019t going anywhere. When employee turnover is high, delivery windows are shrinking, and logistics providers are expected to do more with less, the solution to managing it all could be combining technology and human efforts to gradually improve the delivery process.\nWhat is Driving the Need to Ship Faster?\nEver heard of the Amazon effect? It describes how shoppers\u2019 purchasing habits and expectations have changed due to Amazon. The success of Amazon has transformed the retail industry as companies have evolved to include an online shopping presence for consumers.\nAs explained in Supply Chain Digital, Amazon offers a huge array of products at competitive prices and can ship most of them to a residence within two or three days. That ubiquity of fast, free shipping has led consumers to expect short delivery windows, regardless of what shipper they purchase from.\nIn other words, expectations are changing at the speed it takes to get your next Prime shipment. Seven to ten-day delivery is out, and two-day shipping is in.\nThe Need For Speed\nA Ware2Go survey confirms this phenomenon. In 2020, 75% of survey respondents told the 3PL providers that offering two-day shipping made them more competitive. When asked about the most impactful ways of increasing cart conversions, 56% of merchants mentioned free shipping, and 52% cited 1-2 day delivery. In contrast, only 29% mentioned free gifts with purchase, and a mere 26% referred to in-cart discounts.\nOn the consumer side, fast delivery is becoming less of a bonus offering and more of a requirement. Data from the Retail Industry Leaders Association shows that shipping speed impacts buying decisions for 62% of shoppers. A staggering 90% of consumers view two or three-day shipping as a baseline delivery promise, and 30% of shoppers now expect same-day delivery.\nDelivery speed to consumers is a competitive advantage, but not every company is prepared to offer it. Those who do and onboard the right technology will leverage their logistics to gain a competitive edge.\nWhy is Delivery Speed to Market a Competitive Advantage?\nDespite these numbers, many shippers have not mastered two-day delivery. Companies that do not evolve to accommodate consumer expectations for fast deliveries risk falling behind their competition.\nTwo-day shipping can be time-consuming, headache-inducing, and expensive. Yet there are good reasons to offer it. Here are six of them:\nCompetitive Advantage\nCompanies with a handle on two-day delivery can grab a larger market share from businesses that lag behind. In today\u2019s world, whoever gets a shipment to their customer first, wins. The prize is higher sales and repeat customers.\nCustomers Are Attracted to Logistics Efficiency and Shipping Time Transparency\nOne downside of commerce shifting towards online vendors is that e-retail does not always provide the same brand experience as an in-store visit. However, part of that brand experience can be reclaimed by offering fast and streamlined delivery. It resonates with consumers, so they will be likelier to tell their friends about it or leave a positive review online.\nReduced Inventory Costs\nFast delivery lowers inventory costs. Having less safety stock to store means fewer items taking up space in a warehouse and lower capital expenses.\nRepeat Purchases From Customers Who Enjoyed Their Experience\nAccording to the Ware2Go survey, short delivery times inspire customer loyalty. 59% of merchants said two-day shipping brought in more repeat customers, and 39% mentioned positive reviews online. Or check out this SendinBlue study showing fast or free shipping is a primary driver of brand loyalty for 75% of millennials.\nLess Cart Abandonment\nShort delivery times lead to higher conversion rates. In fact, sixty-eight percent of consumers say that fast shipping leads them to place an online order. Conversely, eighty-five percent of consumers search elsewhere for better options when delivery speeds are too slow. And one of the top two reasons for shopping cart abandonment is that delivery speeds were not fast enough. A few days of the delivery time can literally make or break a purchase.\nHigher Margins\nBelieve it or not, same-day or two-day shipping can result in higher profit margins. That is because when customers need an item quickly, they will be willing to spend more money on it. Instead of doing price comparisons, consumers tend to look for the fastest delivery option.\nHow Technology & Managing By Exception Yield Happier Customers\nSupply chains can be complicated, with many moving parts and opportunities for mishaps. When there is a hiccup, it\u2019s referred to as a freight exception. A freight exception is a catch-all term for anything that might go wrong in logistics. That could include damaged packages, lost packages, missed deliveries, weather disruptions, or even problems with the delivery vehicle itself. \nAs any professional knows, freight exceptions are inevitable in parcel delivery. But exceptions can also make customers pretty unhappy. \nA company\u2019s goal should not be to prevent exceptions but to have a system to deal with them as they occur. Employing the right combination of technology and people can help keep the fallout from freight exceptions to a minimum.\nA cross-platform exception management tool can keep last-mile mishaps from spiraling out of control and prevent customers from deciding to end their relationship with your company. When choosing an exception handling platform, it\u2019s important to look for a solution that utilizes historical data to anticipate future issues. An exception management system can amass logistics data points and analyze them to find recurrent problem areas and their root causes.\nBut technology alone is not enough. When a parcel arrives damaged or goes to the wrong address, communication is critical. Robust exception management software will have people behind it to maintain communication with shippers and consumers.\nUltimately, consumers want their deliveries when they are promised. Managing to stave off exceptions and course-correcting when they do arise can go a long way towards keeping customers happy.\nChoose a Partner Focused on Speed to Market and Improving Customer Experience\nThere are real benefits from improving speed to market, but cutting delivery times also comes with its share of challenges. The good news is that companies do not have to be Amazon to provide fast delivery services. They just need to choose a partner who can help them optimize their speed to market. \nImproving speed to market entails solving duel problems. There\u2019s the need to eliminate as much manual work as possible, which is necessary to maximize efficiency and lower costs. Shippers must also maintain a human touch to deal with those inevitable exceptions. It\u2019s a puzzle that can\u2019t be solved with technology alone. Delivery problems have a tight deadline for resolution, and chatbots or general help lines are inefficient at best. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to choose a last mile partner who uses technology to resolve exceptions before they happen and ensures that there\u2019s always someone to talk to, without compromising either.\nLast mile outlays can comprise more than half of the headline cost of transportation. Couple that with high demand for free shipping, and the connection between a company\u2019s last mile capabilities and profitability becomes clear. Shippers who can shorten their speed to market time and use technology to maximize efficiency have a competitive advantage in today\u2019s market. This is especially true with exception management. That\u2019s why OneRail created a platform that intelligently predicts and searches for resolutions to whatever transportation snags could arise. The OneRail platform has eliminated up to 90% of manual exceptions calls for clients and helps maintain a 98.6% on-time rate If you\u2019re looking for a technology solution that gives you full control over the customer experience with aggregated prices from a vast network and puts you on track to compete with Amazon\u2019s shipping capabilities in less than three weeks, give OneRail a call today!\nPosted in Last MileTagged delivery speed\nPost navigation\nPrevious: How Last Mile Slip Up Translate Into Risks for Customers\nNext: Grocery Logistics: A Guide to Last Mile Grocery Delivery Best Practices\nSEARCH BLOG\nSearch for:\nRECENT POSTS\nOneRail Secures $42 Million Series C Funding to Drive Growth & More Supply Chain Twists\nTaking Back Control: The Evolution to Same-Day Delivery 2.0\nSupply Chains Brace for Trump: From Dollar Stores to Distribution\nPeak Season Myths vs. Reality: Supply Chains Win, Lose & Hit Snooze\nSame-Day Appliance Delivery: How to Level Up Your Operations Fast\nARCHIVES\nArchives\n    \n    Select Month\n      November 2024  (5)\n  October 2024  (10)\n  September 2024  (10)\n  August 2024  (7)\n  July 2024  (7)\n  June 2024  (10)\n  May 2024  (11)\n  April 2024  (8)\n  March 2024  (3)\n  February 2024  (4)\n  January 2024  (3)\n  December 2023  (2)\n  November 2023  (3)\n  October 2023  (3)\n  September 2023  (2)\n  August 2023  (4)\n  July 2023  (3)\n  June 2023  (3)\n  May 2023  (4)\n  April 2023  (4)\n  March 2023  (5)\n  February 2023  (4)\n  January 2023  (2)\n  December 2022  (2)\n  November 2022  (3)\n  October 2022  (1)\n  September 2022  (4)\n  August 2022  (4)\n  July 2022  (4)\n  June 2022  (3)\n  May 2022  (5)\n  April 2022  (3)\n  March 2022  (3)\n  February 2022  (6)\n  January 2022  (2)\n  December 2021  (1)\n  November 2021  (2)\n  October 2021  (1)\n  September 2021  (2)\n  July 2021  (1)\n  May 2021  (1)\n  April 2021  (1)\n  February 2021  (1)\n  January 2021  (1)\n  December 2020  (3)\n  November 2020  (3)\n  October 2020  (2)\n  September 2020  (1)\n  August 2020  (1)\n  July 2020  (3)\n  June 2020  (1)\n  February 2020  (1)\n    CATEGORIES\nCategories\n Select Category\n API integration  (1)\n Artificial Intelligence  (5)\n Company  (8)\n Compliance  (4)\n Delivery Management Software  (5)\n Final Mile  (45)\n Fleet Management  (3)\n Last Mile  (75)\n Logistics  (76)\n Marketing  (10)\n Miscellaneous  (4)\n Multichannel Fulfillment  (14)\n Omnichannel Fulfillment  (40)\n Operations  (27)\n Outsourced Delivery  (1)\n Partners  (2)\n Retail  (11)\n Reverse Logistics  (2)\n Same-day delivery  (7)\n Shipping  (22)\n Trucking  (4)\n Wholesale  (2)\nSee how OneRail can\nsimplify your supply chain.\nLet's Talk\nLast Mile, Delivered.\ninfo@onerail.io (407) 792-6327\nPlatform\nDelivery Order Automation\nMultimodal Optimization\nAutomated Rate Shopping\nReal-time Last Mile Delivery Tracking\nCustomer Experience\nActionable Data\nResources\nResource Center\nBlog\nNewsroom\nCompany\nTrust Center\nAbout\nLeadership\nPartnerships\nCareers\nContact Us\nSupport\nLegal\nTerms\nPrivacy Notice\n\u00a9 2024 OneRail.

                "text": "The OneRail Industry Insights Blog\nThe Transformative Power of AI in Logistics and Last Mile Deliveries\nWRITTEN BY DAVID DAESCHLER, EVP OF DATA SCIENCE & AI POSTED ON OCTOBER 12, 2023\nThe logistics and delivery industry is always a massive, intricate puzzle. Every package, with its unique dimensions and destination, presents the challenge of finding the optimal route amid many possibilities. Traditionally, as I recently spoke about during my presentation \u201cAI Before It Was Cool\u201d at the Trimble Insight Tech Conference + Expo, humans played this game, often making it feel like a repetitive spin on a Vegas slot machine. However, the dawn of AI (artificial intelligence) in logistics promises a transformative change. \nOneRail is at the forefront of this revolution \u2014 we\u2019ve been using AI in our platform for the past three years. Using AI\u2019s power in transportation and logistics, OneRail has achieved impressive feats in the delivery ecosystem: A staggering 98% on-time rate and a platform processing billions of transactions, whether omnichannel or unified commerce. Yet this is only the start. As the complexity of the industry grows, the promise of AI delivery and decision-making shines even brighter.\nThe Rising Importance of Data\nProjected to reach $407 billion by 2027, the AI market could also elevate the US GDP by 21% by 2030. In logistics, where data is as vital as oil, how do data collection and fidelity merge with AI to capitalize?\nThe Pillars of Data: Collection and Fidelity\nEvery click and transaction leaves a digital trace of our choices. Yet, while collecting this data offers rich business insights, it\u2019s about more than quantity. The trustworthiness of data, known as data fidelity, is equally if not more important. Without it, businesses risk chasing false leads, wasting time and harming their reputation. This concept has many layers to consider:\nAccuracy \u2013 Ensuring the data reflects the real value.\nCompleteness \u2013 Having all the necessary information, as gaps can skew insights.\nConsistency \u2013 Uniformity across different sources and formats prevents confusion.\nTimeliness \u2013 Current and available data to make real-time decisions.\nPowering AI for Better Decision-making\nData is the lifeblood of AI and machine learning (ML). The fuel that allows these technologies to learn, adapt and evolve. With vast, diverse datasets, machine learning applications refine their skill, improving pattern recognition over time. The emergence of big data has shifted many organizations from hypothesis-driven models to a \u201cdata-first\u201d approach, valuing the granularity and nuance of vast datasets. Yet, even small datasets have their role, with emerging AI tools transforming processes even when massive data isn\u2019t available.\nUnderstanding AI in Logistics\nThe world of logistics is undergoing a seismic shift, thanks to the infusion of AI, silently orchestrating supply chains as packages crisscross the globe and delivery trucks weave through cities. But what exactly does AI mean in the context of logistics? Let\u2019s clarify some common terms. \nMachine Learning\nAt its core, machine learning is like teaching computers to learn from experience. Imagine a child touching a hot stove; the pain teaches them to avoid it in the future. Similarly, ML models get fed vast amounts of data, training them to recognize patterns and make decisions. In the realm of AI in logistics, ML is the brainpower behind forecasting product demand or preemptively flagging potential shipment delays, ensuring that the supply chain flows smoothly.\nPredictive Analytics\nPicture this: you\u2019re about to embark on a road trip, and a friend tells you the best times to avoid traffic. That\u2019s predictive analytics in action, albeit on a much simpler scale. It dives into historical data, combines it with statistical algorithms and ML techniques, and paints a picture of potential future scenarios. In the world of AI in transportation and logistics, this means anticipating peak shipping times, determining the best routes to avoid congestion and ensuring packages reach their destination on time.\nReinforcement Learning\nHave you ever played a video game where every right move gets you points, and every wrong one deducts them? That\u2019s the essence of reinforcement learning. Here, agents (or algorithms) interact with their environment, making decisions and receiving feedback through rewards or penalties. It\u2019s a continuous loop of action and reaction. In AI delivery and logistics, this concept is invaluable. For instance, it can dynamically optimize delivery routes based on real-time feedback, ensuring that the package reaches its destination and does so in the most efficient way possible.  \nReal-world Applications \nMany of you have heard about the buzz surrounding ChatGPT by OpenAI. Did you know that GPT is primarily a prediction machine? It predicts the next word in a sentence quite accurately based on the context provided by the user. Similarly, OneRail can analyze data from our business to forecast outcomes, such as on-time rates or potential savings. Additionally, given that 65% of consumers are willing to pay a premium for faster, more reliable deliveries, this could significantly boost profits, especially amidst the challenges of congested streets and increasing demands.\nOptimal Package Delivery Paths\nPicture Sarah, a small-business owner who ships artisanal crafts nationwide. Each package is a promise to her customer, and she can\u2019t afford delays. So, when sending a delicate piece to a loyal buyer in a different city, she relies on something other than traditional routes. Instead, she leans on advanced ML models, which sift through countless routes to find the most efficient path. As unpredictable as deliveries can be, from weather-related disruptions to traffic jams to road closures, predictive analytics can help her foresee these potential hiccups, ensuring her crafts reach their new homes on time without a hitch.\nEfficient Deliveries\nHave you ever wondered why some products arrive faster than others, even from the same store? Behind the scenes, predictive analytics is at play, forecasting demand in specific regions. This insight enables companies to position their stock strategically, slashing delivery times. And in an era where every penny counts, dynamic pricing takes center stage. ML models actively adjust delivery prices in real time, considering factors like demand, distance and time of day. Think of it as the stock market of AI delivery, where prices fluctuate to balance demand and supply, ensuring both the customer and the company get the best deal.\nHumans and Machines: A Synergistic Approach\nWe\u2019ve all heard of those dystopian sci-fi stories of machines or robot overlords replacing humanity. But, instead of the feared machine takeover, reality shows that AI in logistics is shaping a future where humans and machines work hand in hand, amplifying each other\u2019s strengths.\nThe Misconception of AI Replacing Jobs\nThe pandemic might have seemed the perfect time for AI to take over human jobs. Still, as Ty Findley from Ironspring Ventures pointed out at the Trimble conference, that didn\u2019t happen. Instead of seeing AI as a job replacer, viewing it as an activity reshaper is more accurate. Repetitive and mundane tasks may transition into digital activities, but this doesn\u2019t spell the end for entire occupations. In essence, while AI excels at handling repetitive requests, as highlighted by Trevor Ward of Rippey AI, it creates space for humans to shine in areas where they naturally excel.\nCombining Human Intuition and AI\u2019s Data-Processing Capabilities\nChris Torrence from Optym emphasized that while humans are invaluable assets in any organization, our brains cannot process the vast amounts of data that AI can. In this unified blend of human and machine, AI shoulders the data-heavy tasks, allowing humans to channel their energy into creative problem-solving, nonlinear thinking, and relationship building. Chief growth officer at freight tech consulting firm Metafora, Ryan Schreiber\u2019s perspective resonates with this, as he notes that when leveraged rightly, technology can magnify human productivity.\nReal-world Implications: Supercharging Logistics Efficiency\nOneRail\u2019s story perfectly captures the powerful synergy between humans and AI. Before integrating AI, Onerail\u2019s dispatchers managed 80 loads a day. With AI\u2019s assistance, they now handle a staggering 3,200 loads daily. This increase showcases AI\u2019s efficiency and role in empowering logistics staff to surpass previous limits and significantly boost their operational capacity. Moreover, by leveraging AI, companies can reduce errors in manual data entry and proactively forecast maintenance needs for vehicles or machinery.\nLast Mile Deliveries: AI\u2019s Pivotal Role\nLogistics, the unsung hero of our digital era, ensures our packages arrive safely and quickly. Now, with the infusion of AI into this sector, there\u2019s a promising horizon ready to address the industry\u2019s most pressing challenges with renewed vigor.\nThe Last Mile Delivery Conundrum\nThe last leg of a product\u2019s journey, often termed last mile delivery, presents a unique set of challenges. Delivering directly to individuals \u2014 whether at their homes or businesses \u2014 adds complexity, unlike the more straightforward task of shipping to distribution centers. The clock is always ticking, with many of these deliveries being time-sensitive, adding pressure to maintain punctuality. Moreover, this final stretch often comes with a heavy price tag, making it the costliest phase in the entire delivery process.\nAI: Revolutionizing Delivery Dynamics\nDespite these challenges, AI emerges as the hero, bringing innovative solutions to the forefront.\nDynamic Routes: Gone are the days of static delivery routes. With AI\u2019s prowess, routes can be adjusted in real-time, considering factors like traffic congestion or sudden weather changes, ensuring timely deliveries.\nPrecision in Predicting Delivery Windows: No more waiting endlessly for a package! AI\u2019s capability to analyze various parameters allows it to offer customers precise delivery time estimates.\nProactive Exceptions Management: In the unpredictable world of logistics, exceptions are inevitable. However, AI can foresee potential hiccups, like missed deliveries, and provide proactive solutions, whether alternative delivery options or timely customer notifications.\nThe Future Outlook\nAI\u2019s imprint on logistics becomes increasingly evident as we prepare for the future. No longer just an assistant for mundane tasks, AI is gearing up to be the brainpower behind resilient, efficient and agile supply chains.\nSupply Chain Optimization: AI\u2019s predictive prowess can help inventory management by fine-tuning stock levels and mitigating overstock and stockout scenarios. AI also offers insights into supplier performance, ensuring a more reliable supply chain.\nPredictive Capabilities: From natural disasters to strikes, AI can foresee potential disruptions, crafting alternative strategies on the fly.\nJob Dynamics: AI\u2019s integration can reshape job roles, but the future will likely emphasize augmentation over replacement.\nAdapting to Tech Evolution: As AI constantly evolves, there\u2019s an imperative for ongoing learning within logistics. Companies should offer periodic tech upskilling sessions and foster collaborations with tech innovators, ensuring they\u2019re always a step ahead.\nThe Future of AI in OneRail: Unlocking New Value\nIn our exploration of AI in logistics, the vast potential of the future stands out. I see a growing appetite for AI-driven data products. This momentum reflects the industry\u2019s eagerness to leverage data, particularly when enhanced by AI.

                "text": "The OneRail Industry Insights Blog\nBest Practices for Sustainable Last Mile Delivery\nWRITTEN BY BILL CATANIA POSTED ON JANUARY 5, 2023\nE-commerce and home delivery are now an integral part of our lives, with over 80% of U.S. consumers shopping online in 2022. Consumers are attracted to the convenience and efficiency of the digital marketplace, but while demand for faster delivery options is increasing, there are also growing concerns about the environmental impact and sustainability of last mile delivery. There is increasing pressure from legislators and consumers to decrease carbon emissions and establish eco-friendly delivery practices while simultaneously delivering goods quickly and efficiently. This creates a complicated challenge for retailers and shippers, but companies must be willing to take action toward sustainability to remain competitive in the marketplace.\nIn this blog, we will explore the challenges shippers face in sustainable last mile delivery, best practices for improving sustainability and how technology is helping to drive sustainable delivery initiatives through optimization. \nChallenges in Last Mile Delivery Sustainability\nSustainable last mile delivery is an important supply chain trend that will continue gaining momentum in the years ahead. Consumers and policymakers are increasingly aware of the supply chain\u2019s environmental impact. They are demanding more oversight and improvements toward sustainability, which present distinct challenges for shippers and retailers.\nCarbon Emissions\nSupply chain greenhouse gas emissions typically make up 80% of a retail company\u2019s total emissions. As demand for last mile delivery grows, so does the number of delivery vehicles needed to meet increasing expectations for speed, resulting in more traffic congestion and even greater last mile carbon emissions. This is worse for food and grocery last mile delivery, as temperature-controlled vehicles create more emissions than non-refrigerated trucks. Meanwhile, governmental regulations and public pressure to minimize carbon footprints are gaining momentum, creating an enormous challenge for companies to find solutions and move toward sustainable last mile delivery.\nComplex Route Planning\nLast mile route planning is extremely complex, and the addition of more stops, more drivers, and more vehicles presents even greater challenges to delivery sustainability. Traditional static route planning is inflexible to changes, cancellations, added stops and detours, and can result in unnecessary miles, wasted space in vehicles, excessive carbon emissions and increased fuel costs. Optimizing route planning is critical to improving last mile sustainability metrics. \nPackaging Waste\nE-commerce and home delivery generated 2.1 billion pounds of plastic packing waste in 2019, a total that is estimated to reach over 4.5 billion pounds by 2025. Non-biodegradable packaging materials like plastic and styrofoam take approximately 500 years to decompose and are increasingly criticized by policymakers and consumers alike. Identifying alternative packaging options and prioritizing the use of recyclable materials is essential for last mile sustainability.\nBest Practices for Last Mile Delivery Sustainability\nConsumer demand for last mile delivery and eco-friendly delivery are increasing simultaneously, putting pressure on retailers and manufacturers to establish sustainable last mile delivery standards. This list of best practices provides tips and strategies to help companies reduce their environmental footprint, while delivering goods quickly and efficiently.\nUtilize Telematics\nTelematic devices like electronic logging devices (ELDs) are attached to delivery vehicles to record driving hours, distance and behaviors. Telematic devices offer immediate feedback on Hours of Service (HOS), driver location and vehicle speed, but also provide valuable data to improve two critical last mile sustainability metrics: fuel efficiency and empty miles.  \nFuel efficiency can be calculated through refuel and miles-driven data and can help identify poor fuel usage, due to driver practices or inefficient routing. \nEmpty miles can be calculated as a percentage of total miles that an on-duty vehicle traveled without goods. \nUtilizing telematics data to identify issues in fuel consumption and empty miles is essential when developing sustainable last mile delivery programs.  \nEstablish a Multimodal Distribution Network\nMultimodal transport is well established as a key component in the global supply chain, but it can also be utilized for distribution models to provide greater flexibility, reduce costs, and improve last mile sustainability and efficiency metrics. Multimodal distribution models employ multiple modes of transport running under a single contract to deliver goods to the final destination and are customized to meet the time, cost or efficiency expectations defined by the shipper or end customer. Multimodal route optimization can improve last mile sustainability by prioritizing eco-friendly vehicles and couriers, eliminating unnecessary miles and reducing total carbon emissions.\nRethink Packaging\nShippers committed to last mile sustainability must consider packaging materials and work toward implementing the \u201c3 Rs\u201d that have long defined waste management: Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. \nReducing the amount of packaging with smaller boxes or less stuffing minimizes waste and can reduce overall weight and improve shipping costs. \nPackaging that can be reused for shipping returns or another consumer use further minimizes waste. \nUtilizing recyclable packaging materials like paper, cardboard or compostable bags is easy to implement and greatly improves the last mile carbon footprint. \nEco-friendly packaging is undoubtedly beneficial for the environment, but it is becoming increasingly important for brand sentiment as well. A 2022 survey found that 86% of consumers are more likely to purchase from a retailer that uses sustainable packaging over a retailer that doesn\u2019t. \nMeasure and Monitor\nData is essential to understanding the environmental impact of last mile delivery. Establishing KPIs and sustainability metrics helps identify areas for improvement and track progress toward sustainability goals. These metrics and KPIs may include fuel consumption, carbon emissions per month or per delivery, amount of packaging used, and missed delivery or redelivery percentages. By consistently collecting and evaluating these metrics, companies can better understand their last mile environmental impact and take steps to improve eco-friendly delivery.\nPartner with Green Companies\nPartnering with companies that have a strong focus on sustainability and environmental stewardship can greatly improve a retailer\u2019s carbon footprint. Suppliers who sustainably source materials and transportation services from providers who limit carbon emissions are essential to establishing eco-friendly brands and products. Technology partners that drive logistics efficiency can further support last mile sustainability through route optimization, advanced data analytics and high-level supply chain visibility. \nTechnology Solutions for Last Mile Delivery Sustainability\nLike many other facets of the supply chain, technology can play a pivotal role in improving last mile sustainability. Shippers should look for technology solutions with several key features:\nMultimodal Route Optimization\nComplex supply chains require multiple modes of transportation to move goods efficiently, but sustainably managing multimodal networks can be challenging, particularly in the last mile. Technology that delivers one point of contact between courier, parcel, LTL and FTL providers simplifies last mile operations and ensures the best mode of transportation for every shipment. API-driven last mile solutions can provide optimized route planning based on a complex set of rules to guarantee that every shipment is optimized, cost-effective and meets eco-friendly last mile delivery standards.\nTracking & Exceptions Management\nMissed deliveries, redeliveries and unexpected route delays can add substantial time and miles to routes and dramatically impact last mile sustainability metrics. Real-time delivery tracking technology helps fill the gaps in last mile risk management with smart exception identification and alerts. This allows logistics teams to proactively address issues and reduce missed deliveries and additional miles to keep carbon emissions to a minimum. \nCourier Management \nThe growing demand for home delivery frequently requires onboarding additional couriers and delivery partners. However, a diversified and fragmented last mile network can present sustainability challenges. Pricing, routing, dispatching and tracking multiple providers can be a logistical nightmare. Technology solutions that integrate courier networks to standardize delivery processes can greatly improve eco-friendly last mile initiatives.\nActionable Data\nSustainable last mile delivery requires advanced data analytics to ensure continuous improvement and to form predictive models that drive future decision-making. Predictive analytics allows shippers to move beyond the visibility of current sustainability issues and toward anticipation of future problems, opening the door for proactive risk mitigation and sustainability improvements.\nImprove Eco-Friendly Delivery & Last Mile Optimization with OneRail\nIn today\u2019s high-demand e-commerce market, seamless and sustainable last mile delivery is essential to meeting consumer expectations and building brand loyalty. Technology solutions to centralize last mile operations deliver the real-time data companies need to meet sustainable delivery goals and drive efficiency.

                "text": "2016 Parcel Pricing & Benchmarking Survey \u2013 Live PARCEL Forum Results Unveiled\nBy Rob Martinez\nEditor's Note: A portion of these results appeared in our November/December issue, but we wanted to be sure you had access to all of the information, especially that which could not fit in the printed issue. We hope you enjoy this peek into one of the most popular sessions at the PARCEL Forum, and we hope to see you there next year, September 18-20, in Nashville! Visit www.PARCELForum.com for more information.\nWe asked the questions, you provided responses. For the fourth consecutive year at the PARCEL Forum, Shipware, LLC conducted a live parcel pricing and benchmarking survey in which 56 shippers responded to survey questions about their parcel usage, carrier preferences, cost reduction strategies and other valuable benchmarking data. Survey respondents collectively commanded approximately $2 billion in annual parcel spend.\nContracts were not shared, but rather, participating shippers responded anonymously to survey questions based on ranges. Technology-enabled and totally blinded to avoid confidentiality concerns, the survey was designed to help shippers to better understand how their pricing stacks up with other shippers. Moreover, all survey responses were cross-tabulated by industry, company revenues, primary carrier, and annual parcel volume/spend for more meaningful like-volume correlations.\nWhy is benchmarking parcel pricing data so critical? Well, the most common challenge I hear from volume parcel shippers is that they don\u2019t know how good \u2013 or bad \u2013 are the incentives, terms and structure of their carrier pricing agreements. While no shipper would ever negotiate a contract and knowingly leave money on the table, the reality is that some shippers have clearly done a better job than others when it comes to negotiating the most favorable rates and terms.\nPublished for the first time to non-survey participants, this article provides survey results on general parcel procurement, general rate increases, strategies to mitigate rising costs and receptivity to US Postal Service parcel products as a compliment to the services of the private national carriers, and more.\nSURVEY DEMOGRAPHICS\nIndustry\nWhile participants included a mix between several industries the most common sector was retail/wholesale/ecommerce followed by 3PL/warehousing/fulfillment and manufacturing.\n\nAnnual Revenues\nSmall and large companies alike were represented with annual sales revenues ranging from under $100M to those businesses that generate revenues greater than $10B.\n\nPrimary Carrier\nPredictably, 95.1% of all survey participants named UPS or FedEx as the \u201cprimary\u201d carriers (as defined as more than half of overall volume). Other carriers included USPS and regional carriers although adoption of carriers outside of FedEx and UPS was not common.\n\nParcel Volume\nAnnual parcel volume revealed a balanced mix of small, medium, large and mega shippers, although as expected for the PARCEL Forum audience, half the survey participants shipped high volumes of more than 2 million parcels annually.\n\nParcel Spend\nAnnual parcel expenditures likewise revealed a balanced mix of shippers of all sizes. Collectively, Shipware estimated survey participants command annual parcel spend of $2 billion.\n\n\nGENERAL PARCEL PROCUREMENT\nBy a margin of 4.5 to 1, survey respondents feel carrier negotiations have become harder rather than easier over the years.\n\nWe followed up asking those shippers that feel it\u2019s harder than ever to negotiate pricing with the major national carriers to explain their answer. Primarily, shippers believe it\u2019s due to the fact that the carriers are focused on operating margins (81.3%), hence tougher pricing negotiations. Others believe it\u2019s because the industry has few national, private carrier options to FedEx and UPS (78.1%), and that pricing has become more of a \u201ccommodity\u201d with pricing so closely aligned between the two rivals (50.0%).\n\nShippers and carriers were busy making pricing changes in 2016. 63.5% negotiated pricing with their primary parcel carrier within the last 12 months. By further correlating actual pricing results mapped to the frequency of negotiations, the data would suggest that those companies having negotiated contracts more recently are in fact driving deeper discounts than those shippers that hadn\u2019t negotiated in more than 2 years.\n\nShipware advocates that shippers should create an expectation with carrier reps of ongoing cost reduction. Notable reasons to bring the carriers back to the negotiation table include changes in shipping profile: volume fluctuation, changes in shipping product utilization, zonal distribution shifts, weight/DIM changes, etc. Moreover, changes in FedEx Earned Discounts thresholds and UPS Portfolio Tier changes, up or down, are legitimate reasons to make contract changes.\nHowever, the most effective rationale for initiating pricing improvements with FedEx and UPS are changes in the market place. The rise of the USPS as a legitimate third option \u2013 especially when comparing Priority Mail to Ground \u2013 regional parcel carrier options, package consolidators and parcel select players, service guide and pricing changes initiated by FedEx and UPS, etc.\nWe followed up by asking what changes were made during the most recent negotiations. Most popular responses were discount improvements (83.3%), contract changes related to accessorial charges (75.0%), revenue threshold changes (56.3%) and adjustments to address General Rate Increases (45.8%).\n\nIt is important to note that what\u2019s meaningful for one shipper may not be meaningful for another. It is important to conduct a comprehensive analysis to understand which pricing contract changes will have the most material impact.\nWhen asked to rank the top three ways shippers would change their UPS and FedEx pricing agreements, minimizing surcharges was the highest weighted response (66.0%), amazingly higher than getting deeper discounts (64.0%). Shippers would also like to lower minimum charges (50.0%) and have more favorable DIM factors/thresholds (44.0%).\n\nWhile historically a UPS discounting vehicle (deferred rebates), FedEx is also offering rebates. Called FedEx Earned Discount Override Program, select shippers who receive rebates get monthly, quarterly or annual rebate checks for meeting negotiated revenue thresholds. Rebates are quickly becoming a popular carrier incentive. 46% of survey participants now get rebate checks from either UPS or FedEx.\n\nThere are pros and cons of rebates. In general, Shipware does not advocate rebates. Rebates are one of many forms of carrier retention tools designed to keep shippers locked into using their services only. Plus, the carrier hangs onto your money for a specific time period (in some cases, one full year). Not good for those companies that need working capital. Rather, we prefer to see the carrier give those discounts to shippers upfront, rather than \u201cearn back\u201d dollars through rebating.\nUnfortunately for shippers, one-sided contract language including Early Termination Agreements (ETAs) \u2013 essentially, financial penalties for terminating parcel contracts prior to its renewal date \u2013 are becoming more common with more than one-third (39.5%) of shippers reporting their contracts include ETAs\nPenalties for \u201cearly termination\u201d are typically stated as a fixed percentage, between 1-3% or more of the previous 52-week net charges (63.6%), but can also be a specific dollar amount (36.4%).\nToday\u2019s parcel contracts often (43.2%) have other retention-focused language including minimum volume commitments. Like ETAs, minimum commitments carry financial penalties should the shipper\u2019s volume fall below stated commitments.\n\nCarrier retention strategies like rebates, ETAs, minimum commitments and many others have been extremely effective in UPS and FedEx\u2019s ability to maintain long term customer relationships despite an extremely competitive industry. In fact, nearly three quarters of shippers (73.6%) feel it would be very difficult to switch their primary carriers.\n\nThese retention strategies contribute to the fact that the majority (55.8%) of shippers surveyed single source (as defined as 80% or more volume going to a single carrier).\nDespite these results, it is surprising that less than half of shippers exclusively (17.4%) or mostly (23.9%) use carrier-provided automation to create shipping labels. The remaining 58.7% mostly or exclusively use manifesting systems that enable greater choice and flexibility in carrier selection.\n\nAnd shippers are continuing the move to greater flexibility and carrier choice, with nearly three quarters reporting that they concurrently or plan within the next year to use rate shopping tools for least-cost, best-way package routing between multiple carriers.\n\nEveryone knows that FedEx and UPS offer package delivery by defined and guaranteed transit times or your money back, right? Yes, but only if you haven\u2019t waived your right to file service claims, which half of our survey audience has done.\n\nFor those shippers that haven\u2019t waived their service guarantees, the majority (88.9%) conduct some level of auditing to identify late packages and other invoice credits. 66.7% outsource the work to professional audit companies. Surprisingly, 11.1% of our PARCEL Forum audience do not audit carrier invoices in any way.\n\nMost shippers expressed concern about recent carrier General Rate Increases (GRI\u2019s) with 93.7% feeling the increases have been \u201cslightly\u201d or \u201ctoo high\u201d.\nGENERAL RATE INCREASES AND COST MITIGATION STRATEGIES.\nEven amongst the survey group\u2019s $2 billion in collective parcel spend, 15.6% continue to receive the standard/published General Rate Increase (GRI). For those shippers that negotiated a \u201ccap\u201d to the GRI, 64.5% are capped between 3-4%. Only 4.4% of shippers have a GRI cap of 2.5% or less.\n\nTo mitigate rising shipping costs over the past year, shippers have tried many strategies including rate negotiations (72.0%), auditing carrier invoices (66.0%), improving packaging to minimize empty fill space and dimensional charges (50.%), and greater use of the US Postal Service, regionals and other alternative carriers.\n\nWhile many of these strategies will continue over the next year, shippers expressed significant increases in many areas, especially using least cost routing software, intensifying the use of the US Postal Service and regionals, zone skipping, continuing to optimize packaging, and focusing on the cost of returns.\n\nSpecific to mitigating higher costs associated with dimensional pricing, shippers are changing box sizes (66.7%), negotiating specific dimension based contract concessions (62.2%), shifting from corrugated to polybags for some shipments, and looking to packaging automation (17.8%). Surprisingly, fully 13.3% of PARCEL Forum shippers surveyed do not plan on taking further action related to dimensional pricing.\n\nU.S. POSTAL SERVICE\nThe last part of our survey recap addresses shippers\u2019 attitudes about the US Postal Service. Comparing survey responses from previous years, shippers are categorically becoming more comfortable with the US Postal Service as \u2013 if not a replacement \u2013 certainly a viable alternative or compliment to FedEx and UPS services. 53.5% of respondents feel USPS Priority Mail is \u201cprobably\u201d or \u201cdefinitely\u201d a viable alternative to FedEx and UPS Air services. The number increases to 56.2% when comparing Priority Mail to Ground services.\n\nDespite the increases over the years, still nearly have of shippers believe the Postal Service is \u201cprobably not\u201d or \u201cdefinitely not\u201d a viable alternative for either Air or Ground services. Reasons cited included poor customer service (51.6%), reliability concerns (41.9%), difficult to do business with the USPS (38.7%), limited tracking (35.5%) and uncompetitive pricing (35.5%) amongst other negative perceptions.\nDespite the ongoing \u2013 but decreasing \u2013 negative perceptions, the Postal Service certainly offers an opportunity for shippers to compare services and pricing. Nearly half of shippers (48.9%) believe they could benefit with faster delivery transit and reduced costs through USPS modal optimization for some packages as a compliment to FedEx and UPS national services. While only 13.3% disagree, 37.8% of shippers just haven\u2019t yet gotten around to exploring USPS opportunities.\n\n\nTherefore, not surprisingly, 65% of shippers do not yet feel their distribution is modally optimized to include all USPS product offerings.\n\nAs a follow up, we asked the 35% of shippers who claim to be optimized with the Postal Service to report savings achieved. 76.5% report savings greater than 5%, with nearly one quarter (23.6%) experiencing savings greater than 15%.\n\nWe asked the audience to list true advantages of the Postal Service. Most popular responses included no accessorial charges (84.6%), shipper friend dimensional pricing (61.5%), 6 day/week delivery (51.3%), competitive pricing (43.6%), ounce-based pricing (35.9%), final mile expertise (35.9%), free packaging (30.8%) and faster transit times (23.1%).\nWhile 28.3% of shippers reporting their use of the USPS to be unchanged over the past year, 43.4% increased \u201cslightly\u201d or \u201csignificantly\u201d. Only 8.6% decreased use of the US Postal Service.\n\nAnd the future looks bright for the Postal Service as 64% of shippers intend to slightly or significantly increase use of its services over the next 12 months.\n\nSUMMARY: BENCHMARKING VALUE & LIMITATIONS\nOf course, benchmarks can only take a shipper so far in their carrier negotiations. While overall volume and revenue certainly play a role in pricing, FedEx and UPS discounts are largely based on the carriers\u2019 analysis of distribution footprints and physical package characteristics, which are directly tied to the carrier cost drivers. Other pricing factors include desired carrier operating ratios, sales commissions, strategic account value, and competitive considerations.\nTherefore, simply reviewing benchmarking data may not be enough to draw conclusions that you, too, should be receiving similar discounts. Benchmarks like those published above will provide shippers with an idea of what\u2019s possible \u2013 high watermarks for which to strive. Finally, when survey questions are cross-tabulated with shipper volume, spend, industry or other key metrics, shippers are better able to correlate their results with more relevant peers.\nRob Martinez, DLP is President & CEO of Shipware LLC, an innovative parcel audit and consulting firm that helps volume parcel shippers reduce shipping costs 10%-30%.

Gordian\u2019s most recent \u201cQuarterly Construction Cost Insights Report for Q4 2023\u201d update reveals a dichotomy of stabilization and persistent challenges that construction professionals must address to ensure timely construction project completion and cost-effective construction supplies delivery.1\nStabilizing Trends and Persistent Hurdles\nIn late 2023, the market breathed a sigh of relief as the prices of key building materials such as structural steel, framing lumber, and conduit decreased compared to the previous turbulent years.2\nAs Todd Burns, President, Project and Development Services, Americas, JLL, articulated: \u201cWith immense housing needs, return to office strengthening and federally backed infrastructure and manufacturing accelerating, the industry is poised for growth despite challenges.\u201d3\nThese challenges include:\nLabor Shortages: Despite a stabilized market, the shortage of skilled laborers remains a significant roadblock, causing construction project delays and escalating labor costs.\nInterest Rate Challenges: Fluctuating interest rates add another layer of complexity, influencing the borrowing costs of construction projects.\nRed Sea Turmoil: Geopolitical unrest has disrupted maritime logistics. These events led to tragic losses and skyrocketing building material freight rates as companies rerouted around Africa to avoid conflict zones.\nRaw Material Shortages: The demand for quality materials is currently outpacing supply, creating a bottleneck that reverberates along the supply chain and exacerbates delays.\nCargo Theft/Fraud \u2013 A new threat of cargo theft and fraud has emerged: \u201cdouble brokering\u201d. The Wall Street Journal reports that fraudsters, masquerading as legitimate carriers, are accepting payments to transport goods but then outsourcing the job and skimming off the top; alternatively, they are absconding with the merchandise to sell on their own accord.4 This fraudulent chain of events creates victims at each link: shippers lose their goods, brokers deal with betrayal, and the actual carriers end up uncompensated. Reports of freight fraud more than quadrupled in 2023 from the year before, according to data from CargoNet.\nWeather Challenges: Unprecedented droughts impeding major river transport corridors have also compounded delayed delivery schedules for construction supplies and already high logistics costs.\nHow to Improve Construction Supply Logistics Efficiency\nGiven the challenges the construction supply industry is facing, efficiency in supply logistics and construction materials distribution is paramount. Here are the best practices to implement to help your business tackle inefficiencies and pave the path to progress:\nImprove Warehousing Systems\nWarehouse automation simplifies processes, saving time and reducing logistics errors. A good Warehouse Management System (WMS) allows for real-time inventory management and tracking, boosting warehouse efficiency, productivity, and accuracy.\nEnhance Customer Experience with Omnichannel Solutions\nThe construction supply industry must create a unified shopping experience to satisfy customer expectations. Omnichannel shopping means integrating online stores with physical retail experiences to ensure consistency across all platforms \u2014 from browsing and ordering construction materials to delivery and support. By giving customers an omnichannel experience, construction supply distributors provide convenience, speed, and a personalized touch.\nEmbrace Digital Transformation\nThe power of digitization can\u2019t be understated. It allows distributors to stay competitive and amplifies distribution efficiency. McKinsey & Company reports that COVID has accelerated digital transformation and that more than 50% of construction executives surveyed have already boosted their digital investment.5 By leveraging technological advancements, companies can meet the fast-paced demands of contractors and customers who crave real-time interactions and intelligent solutions. 80% of B2B customers expect responses and interactions in real time.6\nLeverage Technology for Strategic Advantage\nTechnological advancements are transforming the distribution industry. The integration of omnichannel strategies is just the start. Construction supply distributors can significantly enhance their operations using analytics, supply planning, and logistical support powered by AI and machine learning. These technologies offer a previously unfathomable level of insight and efficiency to every supply chain step, from inventory management to customer engagement.\nAdapt to New Competitors\nA competitive shift in the landscape has also occurred. Established B2B distribution companies are diversifying their offerings while major B2C e-commerce giants are entering the B2B space, bringing the customer-centric focus that has dominated the B2C market. This intensifies the need for traditional construction supply distributors to innovate and adapt or risk losing ground.\nOffer Value-Added Services as a Differentiator\nDistributors are encouraged to enhance their value proposition by offering added services that streamline ordering of quality materials and improve overall customer satisfaction. In a post-pandemic era, these value-added services have become niceties and necessities as consumer expectations carry over into B2B relationship demands.\nRevolutionizing Construction Supply Logistics with Parcel Lockers\nThe addition of parcel smart lockers presents an innovative solution that caters to the specific needs of the construction industry. Here\u2019s how they are changing the game:\nOversized Lockers Work for Distributors\nWith solutions like oversized lockers from Parcel Pending by Quadient, even large and bulky supplies are easily handled.\nFor instance, Ferguson, a leading distributor, recently installed Parcel Pending by Quadient smart lockers and oversized lockers to meet customer demand. With over 1,500 locations across the United States, Ferguson wanted to provide contractors with convenient, self-service transactions for large and bulky items at high-volume sites.\nJohnstone Supply, too, is incorporating smart lockers as part of their supply logistics strategy. The company has over $4.5 billion in annual sales generated by 465 franchise-operated locations across the US and Canada. Quadient\u2019s indoor and outdoor parcel lockers allow Johnstone Supply\u2019s customers to quickly retrieve products at their convenience, allowing them to spend more time at job sites.\n24/7/365 Accessibility\nTime is money, and construction professionals can\u2019t afford delays. Standard electronic lockers and oversized lockers ensure that supplies are available anytime, maximizing efficiency and meeting tight project schedules.\nAdding parcel lockers creates a meaningful point of difference, adds a value-add component, and streamlines customer order fulfillment. Various indoor/outdoor smart parcel lockers meet fulfillment needs, including one-door and three-door oversized solutions. Parcel Pending by Quadient\u2019s Buy Online, Pick-Up in Locker (BOPIL) technology can help construction supply distributors build a consistently superior omnichannel customer buying experience.\nIn the face of ongoing uncertainty within the construction sector, a wave of measured optimism is rising. The industry is adopting forward-thinking supply chain strategies, harnessing insights from data analysis, employing data-centric technological solutions, and adding value-added services such as parcel lockers.\nReady to grow your construction supply business?

This success is the result of close collaboration with long-standing partners, including pick-up point operator Relais Colis and sports retailer Decathlon.\n\u201cThis achievement is a major milestone, thanks to the support from our strategic partners. As we continue to roll out a vast open and shared parcel locker network in France, we're actively preparing to welcome even more new partners,\u201d explains Benoit Berson, Chief Solution Officer, Parcel Locker Solutions at Quadient. \u201cWe are observing a number of players deploying their own locker network, creating a multiplication of urban storage units to the detriment of public space. Besides being unsustainable in the long term, this solution is not thought through from a customer experience point of view. We have designed our network of universal lockers to fit into the urban environment, offering an open solution shared between the various players in transportation, local retail, and service companies. It is the only solution capable of combining the last mile and first mile in a way that is truly service-oriented, eco-friendly and rational over the long term.\"\nFor several years now, Quadient has been gradually extending its network of smart lockers across many countries, offering consumers a convenient, fast and secure solution for collecting their online orders. Available in Decathlon stores for their Click & Collect offer, but also in Carrefour retail stores, shopping malls, train stations and other public areas in France, Parcel Pending by Quadient lockers are an efficient solution for managing deliveries and collections 24/7. In the near future, they will also be available for returns and second-hand parcel depots.\nChristophe Cornilleau, General Manager of Relais Colis, said: \"We are delighted to celebrate this remarkable achievement with Quadient. A long-standing partner for parcel lockers, we are proud to have been by their side from the first installation to this thousandth unit, contributing to the development of their network in France, notably through our partnership with Carrefour. This important milestone demonstrates our shared commitment to offering consumers an ever more convenient and efficient parcel delivery experience. Aware of the climate challenges our industry faces, we will continue to strengthen our collaboration with Quadient, so that together we can meet the market's growing expectations in terms of customer satisfaction and responsible delivery.\"\nQuadient offers a complete portfolio of smart lockers designed to facilitate deliveries and returns, whether installed indoors or outdoors, and able to handle products of all types and sizes for different markets. Quadient currently has more than 18,500 units in operation worldwide. The company aims to accelerate the roll-out of its open network in France in the coming months, continuing its efforts to simplify delivery processes, improve logistics efficiency and guarantee an exceptional customer experience, in a durable and sustainable way.\nTo find out more about Quadient's parcel locker solutions, visit https://www.parcelpending.com.\nContacts\nJoe Scolaro, Quadient\nGlobal Press Relations Manager\n+1-203-301-3673\nj.scolaro@quadient.com\nSandy Armstrong, Sterling Kilgore\nDirector of Media & Strategic Communications\n+1-630-964-8500\nsarmstrong@sterlingkilgore.com\nAt Quadient, we help companies build powerful connections with their customers.\nBecause connections matter.\nProduct\nCustomer Communications\nSmart Mail\nParcel Lockers\nResources\nResources Library\nBlog\nNews\nEvents\nCompare\nPreference Center\nCustomer Success\nCompany\nAbout us\nCommitments\nInvestor Relations\nPartner Programs\nCareers\nSolutions\nIndustries\nHow we help\nSupport\nContact us\nQuadient university\nKnowledge base\nCompliance\n\u00a9 2024 Quadient.

This success is the result of close collaboration with long-standing partners, including pick-up point operator Relais Colis and sports retailer Decathlon.\n\u201cThis achievement is a major milestone, thanks to the support from our strategic partners. As we continue to roll out a vast open and shared parcel locker network in France, we're actively preparing to welcome even more new partners,\u201d explains Benoit Berson, Chief Solution Officer, Parcel Locker Solutions at Quadient. \u201cWe are observing a number of players deploying their own locker network, creating a multiplication of urban storage units to the detriment of public space. Besides being unsustainable in the long term, this solution is not thought through from a customer experience point of view. We have designed our network of universal lockers to fit into the urban environment, offering an open solution shared between the various players in transportation, local retail, and service companies. It is the only solution capable of combining the last mile and first mile in a way that is truly service-oriented, eco-friendly and rational over the long term.\"\nFor several years now, Quadient has been gradually extending its network of smart lockers across many countries, offering consumers a convenient, fast and secure solution for collecting their online orders. Available in Decathlon stores for their Click & Collect offer, but also in Carrefour retail stores, shopping malls, train stations and other public areas in France, Parcel Pending by Quadient lockers are an efficient solution for managing deliveries and collections 24/7. In the near future, they will also be available for returns and second-hand parcel depots.\nChristophe Cornilleau, General Manager of Relais Colis, said: \"We are delighted to celebrate this remarkable achievement with Quadient. A long-standing partner for parcel lockers, we are proud to have been by their side from the first installation to this thousandth unit, contributing to the development of their network in France, notably through our partnership with Carrefour. This important milestone demonstrates our shared commitment to offering consumers an ever more convenient and efficient parcel delivery experience. Aware of the climate challenges our industry faces, we will continue to strengthen our collaboration with Quadient, so that together we can meet the market's growing expectations in terms of customer satisfaction and responsible delivery.\"\nQuadient offers a complete portfolio of smart lockers designed to facilitate deliveries and returns, whether installed indoors or outdoors, and able to handle products of all types and sizes for different markets. Quadient currently has more than 18,500 units in operation worldwide. The company aims to accelerate the roll-out of its open network in France in the coming months, continuing its efforts to simplify delivery processes, improve logistics efficiency and guarantee an exceptional customer experience, in a durable and sustainable way.\nTo find out more about Quadient's parcel locker solutions, visit https://www.parcelpending.com.\nAbout Quadient\u00ae\nQuadient is the driving force behind the world\u2019s most meaningful customer experiences.

Along with most everything else, the cost of doing business has increased significantly in recent years across fulfillment activities, from transportation to labor to packing materials. To counteract these higher costs, retailers are discovering that increasing the number of units per order through bundled offerings helps drive revenue, keeps inventory moving, and creates a win-win situation for them and their customers.\nThe global market for beauty and personal care products generated a revenue of approximately $42.5 billion in 2022. Among all segments of the beauty market, cosmetics showed the highest growth rate and is expected to double current revenue by 2027. In 2023, nearly 900 million people worldwide purchased beauty products online, and this number is expected to exceed 1.2 billion by 2027.\nBeauty brands especially stand to gain from bundled offerings online. The subjective nature of beauty products lends to highly customizable shopping experiences, often imperative when it comes to encouraging consumers to add more items to their cart. For example, a customer purchasing a lip gloss and an eyebrow product could be tempted to purchase product for their cheeks as well (i.e., highlighter, blush, etc.) \u2013 bonus points if they get to choose their preferred shade. The customer benefits from a nice discount overall, and the cart is a third fuller than it was before. Win-win.\nWhat are the benefits for brands?\nIncreased Sales: By offering complimentary or related products in a bundle, brands can entice customers to make a purchase they may not have considered otherwise.\nMargin Expansion: Bundling enables brands to leverage higher units per order, leading to increased average order value (AOV) and improved profit margins. Offering bundled products at a slightly discounted price can encourage customers to spend more, resulting in higher revenue and profitability. \nInventory Management: By encouraging bundling on slow-moving or excess inventory with popular items, brands can clear out stock before a product goes out of style, or out of date. This reduces storage costs, minimizes waste, and optimizes overall supply chain management.\nHow does product bundling benefit consumers?\nValue for Money: By combining complementary products, brands are offering customers more for their money and allowing them to try new products at a lower cost, lending to a more rewarding shopping experience.\nConvenience: You are saving consumers time by providing them with a curated selection of products that fulfill their needs, often delivered in a neatly packaged set for an enhanced experience. This has the added benefit of streamlining the shopping process and enhancing customer satisfaction.\nDiscoverability: Bundling introduces consumers to new products they may not have been aware of otherwise. By including lesser-known or niche products in a bundle, brands can increase their exposure and encourage customers to explore a wider range of the collection.\nWhat are the operational requirements for successful product bundling?\nStrategic product selection: It is important that brands are strategic about bundles. During busy peak periods, for example, it often makes sense to offer pre-kitted bundles, gift sets, etc. to help with speed of fulfillment. However, kit-to-order offerings can create a more personalized shopping experience. This allows customers to easily select the product mix that is perfect for them. Narrowing the offering to select products to choose from helps simplify the decision-making process for the customer while also allowing the DC to plan ahead for an optimal operational flow.\nSeamless inventory management and clear communication: Brands must ensure they have ample stock to meet demand for each product offered. Successfully processing bundles requires highly efficient inventory management. Real-time inventory tracking and forecasting tools can help optimize stock levels and prevent stockouts or overstock situations. Additionally, an advanced WMS should be able to systematically route picking activity throughout the DC in a manner that prioritizes efficiency and accuracy during fulfillment.\nValue for money: Brands must effectively communicate the benefits of the bundled offering to consumers through clear and persuasive marketing messages. Highlighting the value proposition, savings, and convenience of the bundle can help drive customer interest and generate sales. Social media and influencer marketing has a huge part to play here. This holiday season there has been significant emphasis on the beauty advent calendar with significant savings incentivizing customers to buy.\nStreamlined Order Fulfillment: To support bundles, brands must have streamlined order fulfillment processes in place. This includes efficient packaging, accurate tracking, and timely delivery. Ensuring a smooth customer experience from purchase to delivery is crucial to building trust and encouraging repeat business. Brands must ensure that what the customer receives upon delivery matches up to their online shopping experience. There\u2019s nothing more disappointing than being excited about a delivery after a great online checkout, only for your items to arrive poorly packaged, with incorrect products, or at worst, damaged. A well-thought-out packout process is essential to success.\nCost-Efficient Shipping:  To combat the rising cost of transportation, many brands are focusing on increasing the number of products shipped per order. By driving basket size, brands can reduce the cost per item shipped. This approach not only helps to reduce shipping costs, but it can also drive profit by increasing the overall value of each order. By offering incentives such as free shipping for orders over a certain value, brands can encourage customers to purchase more items per order, ultimately increasing revenue and profitability.\nUnlock the benefits of product bundling\nBy leveraging the power of bundled deals, customizable options, and gift sets, brands can increase sales, drive margins, and manage inventory effectively. Simultaneously, consumers enjoy great value for money, convenience, and the opportunity to discover new products from their favorite brands.\nTo support successful bundling strategies, brands must carefully select products, implement effective pricing strategies, manage inventory efficiently, communicate clearly with customers, and streamline order fulfillment, this is where partnering with a proven 3PL provider can make all the difference. With these operational requirements in place, brands can unlock the full benefits of product bundling while delighting consumers and encouraging loyalty.\nJamie Saucedo\nAs Senior Vice President of Business Operations, Jamie is responsible for PFS' global portfolio of 70 brands.

Among these products, plum pollen has emerged as a valuable ingredient due to its nutritional and medicinal properties. Consequently, the extraction of plum pollen has become a focal point for exporters aiming to capitalize on this growing demand.\n\nPlum pollen, derived from the male flowers of various plum tree species, is rich in proteins, vitamins, and minerals. Its potential health benefits, including antioxidant properties, anti-inflammatory effects, and its role in boosting immunity, make it a sought-after product in dietary supplements and functional foods. However, to harness these benefits effectively, advanced extraction technologies are necessary to ensure optimal yield and quality.\n\nOne of the most widely used methods for pollen extraction is the mechanical shaking technique. This method involves gently shaking the plum flowers to release the pollen grains. While it is a straightforward and cost-effective approach, it may not yield the highest quality pollen due to possible contamination with other plant materials. To enhance the purity of the product, exporters often complement mechanical extraction with air or sieve separation techniques, which help eliminate unwanted debris.\n\nAnother promising extraction technology is solvent extraction, which uses organic solvents to dissolve the pollen\u2019s bioactive compounds. This method can significantly enhance the extraction efficiency and concentration of beneficial components. However, the choice of solvent must be carefully considered, as it can impact the final product\u2019s safety and quality. Additionally, the solvent residue must be eliminated meticulously to meet food safety standards required in international markets.\n\nextraction technology of plum pollen exporter\n\n\nEnzymatic extraction is also gaining traction as a more innovative approach. This technique employs specific enzymes to break down the cell walls of pollen grains, facilitating the release of bioactive compounds. Enzymatic extraction is particularly advantageous because it operates under mild conditions, preserving the integrity of sensitive compounds and resulting in higher purity levels. However, this method can be more expensive due to the cost of enzymes and the need for precise control during the extraction process.\n\nOnce extracted, the pollen requires careful handling and processing to maintain its quality during storage and transportation. Freeze-drying is a popular preservation technique that effectively removes moisture while maintaining the nutritional profile of the pollen. This method not only extends the shelf life of the product but also makes it lightweight, which is essential for exporters aiming to reduce shipping costs.\n\nMoreover, the rise of e-commerce and digital marketing strategies has opened new avenues for plum pollen exporters. Establishing a robust online presence can help tap into international markets, allowing producers to reach consumers who are increasingly interested in natural and organic health products.\n\nIn conclusion, the extraction technology of plum pollen plays a critical role in maximizing its potential as a viable export product. By employing advanced extraction methods such as mechanical shaking, solvent extraction, and enzymatic extraction, exporters can enhance the purity and quality of the pollen, meeting the increasing global demand. As the market for natural health products continues to expand, investing in efficient extraction technologies will be essential for the success of plum pollen exporters in the competitive landscape. With the right strategies and innovations, the future of plum pollen in the global market looks promising.\n\n\n\nShare\n\nShare\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nWhatsApp\nLinkedIn\nPinterest\nNext\uff1a\nPolvere di Pesco Keto - Produttori di Alta Qualit\u00e0\nLatest news\n\u041f\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u043f\u044b\u043b\u043a\u043e\u045e \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0430\u0439 \u0432\u0456\u0448\u043d\u0456 \u045e \u043c\u0456\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0434\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f\u045e ODM\nNewsNov.25,2024\nBanana Storage Bag Service for Freshness and Convenience\nNewsNov.25,2024\nAdvantages of Apple Cross-Pollination for Improved Fruit Quality and Yield\nNewsNov.25,2024\napricot pollen pollination company\nNewsNov.25,2024\nhanging fruit bag factory\nNewsNov.25,2024\nExploring the Role of Plum Pollen in Effective Pollination Strategies\nNewsNov.25,2024\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Hebei jiamingliang pollen Co., Ltd.

These bags are not only biodegradable and compostable but also provide a unique and attractive way to package fruits for export. Fruit paper bag exporters are helping to reduce the excessive use of plastic packaging in the food industry. By using paper bags made from recycled materials, they are aligning their practices with the growing global trend towards sustainability. These exporters are not only fulfilling their responsibility towards the environment but also meeting the preferences of consumers who are becoming more conscious of the environmental impact of their purchases. One of the key benefits of using fruit paper bags for export is their breathability. Unlike plastic bags, paper bags allow fruits to breathe and release ethylene gas, which helps to slow down the ripening process and extends the shelf life of the produce. This is particularly important for exporting fruits over long distances, where maintaining freshness is crucial. In addition to their functional benefits, fruit paper bags also offer a marketing advantage for exporters. These bags can be customized with logos, branding, and other designs, making them a great way to promote the company and create a memorable impression on customers. The unique texture and feel of paper bags also add a touch of sophistication to the packaging, enhancing the overall presentation of the fruits\n\nfruit paper bag exporters. Furthermore, fruit paper bags are lightweight, which can help reduce shipping costs for exporters. Since paper bags are typically thinner and lighter than plastic bags, they contribute to lower transportation costs and reduce the carbon footprint of the export process. This makes them a cost-effective and environmentally friendly packaging solution for fruit exporters. As the demand for sustainable packaging continues to rise, fruit paper bag exporters are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. By offering eco-friendly packaging options to their customers, they can differentiate themselves in the market and attract environmentally conscious consumers. This not only helps to enhance their brand image but also contributes to a more sustainable and greener future for the food industry. In conclusion, fruit paper bag exporters play a vital role in promoting sustainability and reducing plastic waste in the food industry. By choosing paper bags as a packaging solution for fruits, exporters are not only meeting the demands of the market but also contributing to a more eco-friendly and responsible supply chain. With their functional benefits, marketing advantages, and cost-effective nature, fruit paper bags are indeed a smart choice for exporters looking to make a positive impact on the environment.\n\n\nShare\n\nShare\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nWhatsApp\nLinkedIn\nPinterest\nNext\uff1a\nPromoting apple pollen tube growth through exporting proteins and signaling molecules\nLatest news\n\u041f\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u043f\u044b\u043b\u043a\u043e\u045e \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0430\u0439 \u0432\u0456\u0448\u043d\u0456 \u045e \u043c\u0456\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0434\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f\u045e ODM\nNewsNov.25,2024\nBanana Storage Bag Service for Freshness and Convenience\nNewsNov.25,2024\nAdvantages of Apple Cross-Pollination for Improved Fruit Quality and Yield\nNewsNov.25,2024\napricot pollen pollination company\nNewsNov.25,2024\nhanging fruit bag factory\nNewsNov.25,2024\nExploring the Role of Plum Pollen in Effective Pollination Strategies\nNewsNov.25,2024\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Hebei jiamingliang pollen Co., Ltd.

                "text": "Back To All Content\nOctober 19, 2023\nHow are E-commerce Shipping Costs Calculated?\nE-Commerce|Blogs\nBy: Beth Owens\nThe rising cost of shipping is a problem for small and large businesses alike - especially as consumer expectations for fast shipping only continue to grow. But to create with a viable solution for high shipping costs, you need to understand what goes into the price on the shipping label.\nThe truth is that a lot of factors go into determining shipping costs - and some of them might surprise you.\nSo, how are shipping costs calculated, and how can brands use this information to their advantage to reduce shipping costs?\nIn this blog, we're going to cover what factors go into calculating shipping costs and share actionable strategies to help keep your shipping costs as reasonable as possible.\nTL;DR\nAccurate shipping cost calculation helps identify areas for cost reduction and maximizes profit margins.\nKey factors in calculating shipping costs include dimensional weight, package weight, shipping zones, and shipping speed.\nIt's also important to consider additional costs like peak season surcharges, accessorial charges, and duties/taxes can also impact shipping rates.\nWhy it's important to accurately calculate shipping costs\nIdentify what is pushing up your costs. Shipping rates may be expensive, but there are probably additional factors under your control that are resulting in unnecessary dollars being spent. For example, a lack effective cartonization will result in a higher DIM weight for a package, which means a higher cost to ship. By assessing these characteristics, you can identify where you can reduce shipping costs.\nMaximizing profit margins. Regardless of whether you are paying for shipping or passing on the cost to your customer, shipping costs have a direct impact on your profitability. If your customer is paying for shipping, you need to know what your average shipping costs are in order to pass on a competitive fee that minimizes cart abandonment, or set up an accurate free shipping threshold.\nShipping costs fluctuate throughout the year. Shipping is never a 'set and forget' strategy, because shipping services are constantly being re-evaluated by carriers as operational costs rise. Between peak season surcharges and general rate increases, brands need to be consistently checking in to see if their current shipping strategy is aligned with average shipping costs.\nWhat you need to determine shipping costs\nA carrier's shipping calculator is a very handy tool to get an idea of what different shipping options or speeds are going to cost you. However, those estimates are only going to be as good as the data you give it. To get accurate estimates for shipping a package, you need to have the following information to hand:\nDimensional weight\nDIM (dimensional) weight is a method used by carriers to calculate shipping prices based on cubic size, rather than the actual weight of the package. Most shipping companies including USPS, FedEx, and UPS now use dimensional weight for domestic and international shipments, unless the actual package weight is greater. This reflects how space is becoming a premium on delivery vehicles and packages are being billed accordingly.\nCalculating shipping costs requires measuring package dimensions accurately. To calculate DIM weight, you need to determine the package's cubic size, divide it by the carrier's dimensional weight divisor, and round up to the nearest whole number.\nPackage weight\nAs we stated above, actual package weight comes into play to calculate shipping costs when actual weight of a parcel is higher than dimensional weight. The heavier a parcel is, the more it will cost to ship. Packages that are over a certain weight may have to be shipped using dedicated shipping services.\nNumber of shipping zones\nShipping zones are geographical regions that allow carriers to calculate the distance that packages need to travel from the origin to the shipping destination. This helps carriers to calculate shipping rates and delivery times effectively and more predictability. The more shipping zones that a parcel has to cross to get to its destination, the higher the average shipping costs will be.\nBusinesses can shorten shipping distances by operating multiple fulfillment centers. By allocating orders to the location that is closest to the end customer, packages will cross fewer shipping zones and cost less to ship.\nShipping speed\nSpeed always comes at a premium in shipping. Expedited shipping options will cost retailers considerably more, especially when combined with any of the above like a high DIM weight or multi-shipping zone deliveries. The faster you want a package to arrive (and for that rapid delivery date to be guaranteed) the higher that shipping rates will be.\nFor example, a brand's average shipping costs are going to be considerably higher if they are using an overnight service for their orders, as opposed to an economy or standard shipping method that takes 3-5 days to arrive.\nAdditional costs to be aware of\nThe areas outlined above form the foundation of how carriers calculate their base rates for both domestic and international shipping. However, these are not the only charges that brands should be aware of when trying to accurately calculate shipping costs.\nIn addition to the base shipping rate, shipping carriers will bring in additional fees at certain times of year or charge additional costs on packages that meet certain criteria. It's important to have an in-depth understanding of these fees so your business can estimate shipping costs and set the right budget for their needs:\nParcel handling related charges\nShipping and handling costs refer to the materials and time required to get parcels ready for shipment. This includes packaging materials, labor, storage, specialized equipment, and more. If you partner with a 3PL, these costs will take the form of line items that are charged as part of your overall fulfillment costs. If you are self-fulfilling customer orders these costs may be less visible, but nonetheless form a key aspect of your shipping costs.\nDemand surcharges\nDemand surcharges, also known as peak season, are additional fees that major shipping carriers impose on top of their regular shipping rates to account for higher operational expenses during peak demand periods like the holiday season. Typically, these surcharges are fixed amounts applied to each package. Demand surcharges should not be confused with a General Rate Increase, which recognizes a longer-term growth in operational costs within the shipping industry.\nResidential delivery fees\nDelivering parcels to residential addresses is much more costly and inefficient than commercial addresses, as every package requires a tailored delivery route and drop-off. Because of this, shipping carriers may levy a residential delivery surcharge on these packages during busy times of year like the holiday season, or in cases where a business has not selected a residential package service, for example FedEx Home Delivery.\nShipping insurance\nFor certain high-value items, it's worth considering adding on shipping insurance to protect against theft or damage in transit. This avoids the merchant having to foot the bill for replacement items or return shipping costs, which quickly eats into your profit margins. Some shipping rates come insure parcels up to a certain value, so it's important to understand when you might need additional insurance.\nAccessorial charges\nAccessorial charges are applied in scenarios where a parcel cannot be processed using a carrier's regular automated process. This includes oversized packages, extra equipment being required, or any form of manual handling during the sortation process. For example, if a polymailer got stuck in a sortation machine and needed to be removed by a worker, this would be considered as additional handling and would likely incur a charge. Unlike peak season surcharges which are billed upfront when the package is shipped, accessorial charges after the fact.\nDuties and taxes\nWhen shipping internationally, businesses need to decide how they are going to manage the duties and taxes that may be applied to shipments. There is a choice to be made between Delivery Duty Unpaid (DDU) and Delivered Duty Paid (DDP). DDU places the responsibility for taxes and customs fees on the buyer, with the seller handling only the shipment costs and documentation. In contrast, DDP means the seller covers all duties and taxes, as well as shipping the goods to the customer. DDU offers buyers more control but can result in surprise fees and delays, potentially leading to customer complaints.\nTips to reduce shipping costs\nCheck a shipping cost calculator\nShipping calculators allow you to quickly get a shipping cost comparison between different carriers. All major carriers including United States Postal Service, UPS, and FedEx have a shipping calculator available on their website. You can also invest in shipping software that can compare shipping rates in real-time using one interface. For example, Ryder E-commerce uses our in-house SmartRate selection tool to assess a customer's order history and determine the best shipping strategy for their needs.\nUse flat rate shipping\nBecause flat fee shipping methods calculate rates on package size rather than the weight of the package, it offers a great way for businesses to standardize their shipping costs and save money on longer delivery distances. Flat rate shipping is also commonly exempt from peak season surcharges, as well as including packaging within the shipping rate. Major carriers including USPS, FedEx, and UPS all offer their own versions of flat-rate shipping. But while flat-rate offers predictable costs and is well-suited for free shipping promotions, it may not suit businesses who are doing a lot of short-haul deliveries or those seeking creative branding opportunities.\nUse a free shipping threshold\nImplementing a free shipping threshold for online orders allows e-commerce businesses to offer free shipping without sacrificing profitability to low-value orders. Calculating the optimal free shipping threshold requires analyzing your average order value and shipping fees to find the right balance between enticing customers and protecting your profit margins. However, setting the right threshold is crucial, as too low or too high thresholds can impact average order values and cart abandonment rates. It's also essential to account for bulky or heavy items in your calculation, and decide whether or not to exempt these from your threshold.\nShipping consolidation\nOnline shoppers frequently encounter split shipments in e-commerce, where a single order is divided into multiple deliveries. While this may seem advantageous in getting certain items to the customer faster, it results in much higher shipping fees, not to mention higher shipping related charges like packaging and order fulfillment. Split shipments occur for several reasons, including poor inventory management and cartonization strategies. Instead, allow customers to opt for order consolidation options to save money and be more sustainable.\nUse multiple shipping speeds\nIt may come as a surprise, but not every customer is going to want rapid shipping - especially if this results in additional costs to their order. According to Shippo\u2019s 2023 State of Shipping Report 75% of consumers who were given the choice between a free and fast shipping offer would choose free shipping. Brand can keep their shipping costs low by offering free shipping options on slower shipping speeds, while offering faster shipping rates at an additional cost. This enables your brand to offer consumers more flexibility via a full spectrum of shipping services, without breaking the bank.\nYou can learn more about e-commerce shipping trends in our 2023 E-commerce Consumer Study.\nConsider a third-party logistics (3PL) provider\nDetermining shipping costs and implementing changes to your shipping strategy is an ongoing responsibility that takes precious time away from other areas of your business. Partnering with a 3PL for e-commerce fulfillment not only takes this responsibility off your plate, but qualifies you for discounted shipping rates due to partner's high shipping volume. This is one of the most effective ways to reduce overall shipping costs while also getting access to advanced parcel expertise.\nRelated Content\nNovember 18, 2024\nHow to Prevent Overselling During Sales\nE-commerce digital platform for inventory management\nRead More\nNovember 15, 2024\nHoliday Shipping Deadlines\nGet Packages There On Time\nRead More\nNovember 11, 2024\nRyder and Mugsy Jeans\nCreating the Perfect E-commerce Fit\nExplore Other Topics\nLogistics\nTransportation Services\nRyder Last Mile\nFleet Management\nSubscribe Today\nWant the latest industry insights?

                "text": "Back To All Content\nDecember 12, 2023\nManage Accessorial Charges to Lower Shipping Costs\nE-Commerce|Blogs\nBy: Beth Owens\nBeyond the standard shipping rates paid by shippers, accessorial charges play a crucial role in determining the overall cost of shipping packages from A to B. These additional fees, ranging from address correction to redelivery or additional handling, can significantly impact a company's bottom line if efforts are not made to mitigate them.\nThe fact that accessorial fees are not charged until after shipment causes many businesses to trip up on the fine print. Nobody likes surprise charges - especially when shipping is already such a massive running cost.\nIn this blog, we're going to explore accessorial charges, how they are applied, and what businesses can do to prevent these additional fees from piling up.\nWhat are accessorial charges?\nAccessorial charges are additional fees or surcharges levied by parcel carriers on top of regular shipment rates. Accessorial fees are designed to cover scenarios that fall outside of the standard shipping services. This includes any extra services, resources, or time spent carrying out specific shipping requests or activities. Accessorial charges are normally charged on a per-shipment or per-package basis and accumulate as separate line items.\nWhy do shipping carriers apply accessorial charges?\nThe price paid by the shipper to send a package is carefully calculated to take into account a range of factors, including:\nPackage weight\nDelivery route miles\nDestination\nService level\nBut there is another side to this equation: The amount of operational resources and time it takes to process that package from beginning to end.\nBecause the need for additional handling or processing services may not become apparent until after the shipping rate has been paid, accessorial charges applied after the fact ensure that parcel carriers are not on the hook for those extra costs.\nFor example, if a parcel or envelope becomes stuck in a sortation machine and needs to be processed manually, an accessorial fee for additional handling ensures that carriers are compensated for the additional effort required.\nWhat is the difference between accessorial charges and demand surcharges?\nAccessorial charges and demand surcharges are terms that are used interchangeably when talking about additional fees levied on shipments. However, they are targeted at different scenarios.\nWhile accessorial charges are targeted at compensating carriers for additional services, additional equipment usage, or time, demand surcharges are applied to cover increased operating costs during periods of high demand for delivery services. This is most common during the holiday season, though it can occur at any time of year when parcel volumes spike (as was seen during the COVID-19 pandemic).\nAccessorial charges may increase temporarily during the holiday period in response to operational pressure on parcel networks. But demand surcharges are influenced by broader market factors, and so are not directly tied to additional services as accessorial fees are.\n\u201cThe main difference for the shipper that is demand surcharges are volume-based, while accessorial surcharges apply to any package regardless of volume or destination,\u201d says Sean Kim, Vice President of E-Commerce Experience and global Parcel Strategy at Ryder. \u201cDemand surcharges are billed upfront, but an oversize or additional handling surcharge will get billed after the fact, which can come as a nasty surprise to shippers.\u201d\nThere's another key difference that shippers need to take into account: While demand surcharges are almost impossible to avoid during peak season, accessorial charges can be prevented with the right planning and execution.\nCommon types of accessorial charges\nAdditional handling surcharge\nAs parcel sortation has become increasingly automated, most carriers will levy an additional fee when a package requires manual interaction beyond standard procedures. This could be due to a parcel's large size, fragile items, or packaging type. This type of accessorial charge is designed to compensate carriers for the extra labor and resources the additional handling requires, as well as the potential increased risk of injury or damage.\nExample: A parcel or freight shipment may include special handling instructions for the parcel, such as \"place this side up\" which requires extra attention by delivery personnel. This may trigger an additional handling surcharge, especially if an advance notification is not given to the carrier.\nFuel surcharge\nGas is one of the biggest running costs for any transportation provider, so it's common for parcel carriers to pass on some of this cost if gas prices rise beyond levels that a base shipping rate can support. Fuel surcharges are dynamic, and may come into effect with little warning. Typically, they are set based on the current price of fuel, such as the U.S. Department of Energy's Diesel Fuel Index.\nExample: UPS reviews its fuel surcharge weekly to ensure that it keeps pace with current fuel prices. As of 11/13/2023, there is a 15.25% fuel surcharge on all Ground Domestic shipments.\nAddress correction surcharge\nAddress validation is an important step in the shipping process. This is where the carrier checks that the address provided is accurate and deliverable. If the address provided does not match an address within the carrier's postal system, they may apply an address correction fee to cover additional labor and time taken to correct the delivery address. Common address mistakes that trigger accessorial fees on a shipment include incorrect postcodes, incomplete delivery addresses, or incorrect formatting which causes manual address validation to be required.\nExample: An online shopper fails to include their apartment number on the delivery address, meaning that the delivery truck driver doesn't know where the package needs to be left. In this scenario, the parcel carrier will need to contact the customer to ask for additional delivery information, resulting in a surcharge.\nScheduled pick up surcharge\nIf a business wants the parcel carrier to pick up their parcels instead of going to the post office, this is an additional service that the carrier may charge for. This is more likely to occur if the pick up is taking place outside of the carrier's standard pick up windows or out of route miles, or if the shipper is not eligible for any volume-based discounts.\nExample: If an e-commerce business wants a parcel carrier to pick up a group of priority packages from their warehouse on a Saturday, this may qualify for extra accessorial charges, either per package or as a percentage of the total shipping cost. USPS, for example, charges $14.75 for Pickup on Demand on Express Mail, Priority Mail, and Parcel Post services.\nDelivery area surcharge\nA delivery area surcharge (DAS) applies when a parcel carrier is delivering a package that is either outside of their regular area of operation or is more difficult or time-consuming to access. The surcharge helps to compensate for the additional cost and inefficiencies of delivering to these locations and may be applied according to zip code, delivery type, or infrastructure quality.\nExample: Carriers often designate certain zip codes with higher delivery costs as being liable for delivery area surcharges. This is most common in rural areas, which are less accessible by major highways or airports. UPS levies extra costs of $2.10 per package that is delivered to a residential destination belonging to a specified list of zip codes.\nResidential delivery surcharge\nDeliveries to residential addresses are among the least efficient for parcel carriers to execute, since each address may only be the recipient of one package compared with multiple deliveries of hundreds of packages to commercial addresses. Residential delivery surcharges are designed to cover the higher operational costs of serving a residential area, such as apartment buildings and suburbs. This may take the form of an additional fee, or be calculated into the pricing structure of a particular service.\nExample: Although it specializes in delivering to residential addresses, FedEx Home Delivery still applies a separate residential delivery charge of $5.15 per package in addition to the base shipping rate.\nLarge package surcharge\nPackages that are larger than a certain size or weight dimensions specified by the carrier may be liable for a large package surcharge to cover the additional time and effort of loading or unloading these packages. Different carriers will use different criteria for determining when the surcharge is applied, including the length, width, height, and overall volume of the package. The size of the surcharge is either a flat fee or scaled depending on how much the package exceeds the carrier's size or weight limits.\nExample: Given that large packages can be considerably more difficult for carrier personnel to load or unload, it's not unusual for large package charges to be some of the largest accessorial fees awarded by carriers. FedEx's oversize surcharge, for example, is determined by the number of zones a package is traveling, with a large package on FedEx Home Delivery costing $160 per package for zone 2.\nRedelivery surcharge\nIf a package is unable to be delivered successfully to the delivery address given, the parcel carrier may impose a redelivery charge to cover the cost of making another delivery attempt. Failed deliveries can happen for various reasons, such as the recipient not being available, an incorrect address, or limited access to the property. Some carriers may provide one extra delivery attempt under the base shipping rate, while others may charge for all subsequent delivery attempts.\nExample: If a delivery driver cannot find a secure place to leave a parcel that will keep it safe from theft, delivery regulations may demand that the parcel must be kept and re-delivered on a future delivery run.\nHow to manage accessorial charges for lower shipping costs\nAvoid simple errors that trigger accessorial surcharges\nMany of the most common accessorial charges are caused by mistakes on behalf of the shipper that take time and resources by the carrier to correct. Scenarios such as incorrect addresses, failed deliveries, and additional handling can be avoided entirely with a little extra preparation.\nFor example, implementing address validation into your shipping workflow ensures that you are using the right address before the parcel is in the hands of the carrier, reducing the likelihood of correction fees being applied. Ryder's platform, for example, uses carrier databases to ensure that addresses are spelled and formatted correctly.\nLikewise, businesses can avoid redelivery charges by ensuring that customers are aware when their order is out for delivery. Sending a delivery notification when parcel drop-off is imminent allows customers to plan to be home to receive their package, reducing incidences of failed delivery.\nUse the right service for each parcel\nDifferent types of customer orders will be suited to different services, depending on characteristics like dimensional weight or contents i.e. hazardous materials. The shipping service you choose can be the difference between not only optimizing freight costs but also whether any accessorial charges are applied.\nUsing specialist freight carriers for extremely heavy or large packages, for example, reduces large package surcharges because freight shippers are better equipped to manage oversized products compared with other carriers. Using local or regional delivery services can also help to avoid delivery area surcharges, as delivery routes are tailored to specific zip codes.\nShipping method mapping is a great way to map orders containing certain criteria i.e. order value, product type, delivery destination, and speed to specific shipping methods you are using. This saves valuable time allocating orders manually and ensures that they are being shipped using the most appropriate service that reduces accessorial fees.\nPay close attention to surcharge updates\nCarriers may update their accessorial charge policies with limited warning, especially ahead of the holiday season or in preparation for the new financial year. Raising accessorial fees by $0.10 or $0.20 might not sound like a lot, but multiplied by hundreds of parcels, this increase can seriously undermine your profit margins. Be sure to regularly check the websites of the carriers you use and subscribe to alerts to stay informed and adapt your shipping strategies accordingly.\nPartner with a 3PL\nIn addition to making shippers eligible for wholesale shipping rates, another upside to partnering with a 3PL is that they can help to identify where accessorial charges are coming from - and come up with strategies to mitigate them.\n\u201cAt Ryder, we quantify exactly how many and which packages had accessorial charges applied, down to the individual tracking numbers,\u201d says Kim. \u201cThis allows us to work with customers to understand what shipment characteristics are causing problems and how to remedy them.\u201d\nBy leveraging the experience of a 3PL partner like Ryder, businesses can future-proof their shipping strategy with inside advice on what is causing the majority of accessorial charges, enabling them to sustainably reduce shipping costs - from the ground up.\nRelated Content\nNovember 18, 2024\nHow to Prevent Overselling During Sales\nE-commerce digital platform for inventory management\nRead More\nNovember 15, 2024\nHoliday Shipping Deadlines\nGet Packages There On Time\nRead More\nNovember 11, 2024\nRyder and Mugsy Jeans\nCreating the Perfect E-commerce Fit\nExplore Other Topics\nLogistics\nTransportation Services\nRyder Last Mile\nFleet Management\nSubscribe Today\nWant the latest industry insights?

According to Khaled Naim, co-founder and CEO of Onfleet, both delivery and online sales continue to grow despite inflation. Food-at-home prices increased more than 13% over the past 12 months, marking the largest 12-month increase in 43 years. Though consumer price sensitivity is at an all-time high, Americans have become dependent on online ordering and delivery services for staple consumer goods because of the convenience and added health safety. So, as we hopefully near a post-pandemic era, what will the future hold for the last mile? \u2022 Demand for faster, more streamlined last-mile grocery delivery will continue to grow as consumer expectations rise. \u2022 Ease of scalability will be key to grocer success with last-mile delivery. \u2022 Grocers will leverage delivery management technology to make delivery a competitive advantage. \u2022 Modernization of the last mile will become a reality as more grocers begin their digital transformation. As last-mile delivery becomes essential to consumers, the cost of inaction in the grocery delivery market will be steep.

These disruptions could have extended beyond the rail sector itself, and affected other transportation modes, primarily trucking, according to Uber Freight, who estimates that even if 20% of rail freight shifted to trucking, spot rates could\u2019ve doubled in just that short period of time. \u201cAs we\u2019ve learned from the past two years, the truckload market is very sensitive to disruptions in supply and demand. While spot rates react quickly to such changes, contract rates lag by a few months. Therefore, a disruption of this magnitude would have a direct impact on spot rates,\u201d according to Uber Freight. Data indicates that the average weight of a carload is 128,000 pounds and that of an intermodal load is 33,000 pounds. According to the Commodity Flow Survey, rail carries about the same amount of freight as for-hire truckloads (measured in ton-miles). When excluding local hauls (less than 100 miles) and light loads (less than 10,000 pounds, which are likely LTL shipments), rail carries 33% more freight than long-distance for-hire truckloads. Total emissions produced by all the truckload freight and 20% of the served rail freight would have increased by 19%. Scan the QR code to learn more In addition to the known supply chain shortages, the current trucking industry challenges https://foodl.me/dmluym are having negative impacts on cold chain integrity, increasing the potential for temperature excursions that could accelerate the degradation of perishable food quality and safety. Yet, despite the emerging complexities of this new trucking industry landscape, cold chain stakeholders have access to data analytics, tools and services to help them maintain their strict quality standards, according to Doug Thurston, VP of sales, cold chain digital solutions at Emerson.\nMost importantly, data provides an objective record of cold chain temperatures in-transit. In challenging times like these, where truckers and retailers simply can\u2019t afford the negative impacts of rejected loads, data serves as an arbiter of supply chain disputes. It takes emotion out of the equation by providing indisputable proof of precisely when and where temperature excursions occur.

Develop new plan. Implement new process. Execute. New disruption occurs. Pivot again. Rinse and repeat.\nAt some point, when is the \u201cNew Normal\u201d not so new? At what point does the New Normal become Old News? Begs the question of, what does a normal supply chain really even look like?\nIs it disruption-proof? Is it cybersecurity-safe? Is it running on all cylinders with a full staff? Is it equipped with all the latest tools and technologies? Is it automated, cloud-based or hands-free?\nBetter yet, does this so-called \u201cnormal\u201d supply chain even exist?\nPrior to 2019, nearly all supply chains were considered normal. They operated the same way, day in and day out, with only a few hiccups here and there.\nPost-pandemic though, normal has been redefined to better suit the nature of how supply chains operate in a disruption-laden environment.\nNatural disasters, port strikes, rail strikes, worker shortages, inflation and risk continue to present bottlenecks in all facets of the supply chain, leading some to believe that the logistics space may never achieve normalcy again.\nCase in point: Nearly 45% of economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal estimated bottlenecks would ease by the second half of 2022. Yet, here we are, about to turn the page to 2023, and the supply chain still seems anything but normal.\nChina, for example, continues to enforce a zero-COVID-19 policy \u201cthat can partially or fully lock down major cities like Chengdu, Shenzhen, Xian, or Shanghai,\u201d says Mirko Woitzik, global director, intelligence solutions at Everstream Analytics. \u201cWhile this persists, we will continue to see port, airport and city shutdowns, as well as extended travel bans, which will impact supply chain logistics.\u201d\n\u201cThe global economic slowdown and rising inflation rates will also create workforce and labor issues within the supply chain. This will add financial pressure to many parts of the supply chain that are still reeling from the impacts of COVID-19 coupled with the war in Ukraine. Cost-cutting measures will likely increase labor shortages in critical parts of the supply chain from food production to ports and railways, which have the potential to cause further turmoil,\u201d adds Woitzik.\nOther factors such as inflation and rising fuel costs, to name a few, continue to put a strain on the supply chain.\nOn the other hand though, several industry leaders detail how this return to normalcy may not be as far-fetched in 2023 as currently perceived, but it will still be very different from prepandemic.\nSupply chains are unlikely to stabilize until first half of 2024 and beyond, while 22% expect disruptions to continue until the second half of 2023, according to a Carl Marks Advisors survey.\nIn a separate report, Citi economists said logistics pressures from excessive consumer demand for goods are easing up, yet companies shouldn\u2019t consider an \u201call clear\u201d just yet.\nThe physical shortage of capacity, which drives up freight rates, doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue at this time, according to SeaIntelligence, with models suggesting that a return to \u201cnormal\u201d at a 2% capacity loss baseline by early 2023 is possible.\n\u201cIn supply chain circles battered by more than two years of upheaval, the word \u2018normal\u2019 is creeping into the outlook for 2023. From the Logistics Managers\u2019 Index to the New York Fed\u2019s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, we\u2019re seeing forecasters more optimistic about the future outlook,\u201d says Ben Harris, senior managing director, client solutioning and strategy at Cushman & Wakefield. \u201cAnd while we\u2019re optimistic that they\u2019re right, we continue to see continuing challenges around raw materials and labor shortages, which are unchanged since last year at this time. Hopefully things will start to substantially ease by summer 2023, but it is going to be bumpy and uneven.\u201d\nIn order to obtain somewhat of a normal way of doing business, companies must adhere to a New Normal, but in a way that\u2019s defined as new on a regular basis. Think of it as an alternate state of the supply chain, where the timeline has skewed to create a new supply chain space [Back to the Future fans, anyone?]. This new continuum is laden with bottlenecks, strikes and challenges never before experienced.\nAnd, it\u2019s all happening at once. And, it\u2019s all normal.\n\u201cInstability and disruption are the New Normal. We must acknowledge the inevitable and shift our focus not only to building more adaptive, responsive and resilient supply chains, but addressing the systemic factors that contribute to ongoing risks and rising costs,\u201d says Tom Madrecki, VP of supply chain and logistics, Consumer Brands Association.\nRail strike strikes back\nIn early October, U.S. supply chains dodged a rail strike, one that would\u2019ve embargoed shipments and further crippled global supply chains. President Biden enforced a 60-day cooling off period, where the Presidential Emergency Board looked at the disputed issues in the negotiations and issued a recommended settlement. These disruptions could have extended beyond the rail sector itself, and affected other transportation modes, primarily trucking, according to Uber Freight, who estimated that even if 20% of rail freight shifted to trucking, spot rates could\u2019ve doubled in just that short period of time. Fast forward a month later, and rail workers continue to express concern over their current labor contracts. Analysts say a possible next shutdown could \u201champer passenger service and slow the flow of goods to stores and warehouses. A union strike could cost the U.S. economy up to $2 billion per day, according to an estimate from the Association of American Railroads. Roughly 40% of the nation\u2019s long-distance trade is moved by rail\u2014more than any form\n@Kalyakan.stock.adobe.com of transportation\u2014and a union strike could stop more than 7,000 trains from operating,\u201d according to Time.com.\nInstabilities in this sector are projected to continue for the next couple of years.\nProblems at the port\nThen there\u2019s problems at the port, which didn\u2019t just happen overnight and certainly didn\u2019t start when the EVER GIVEN got stuck in the Suez Canal.\nThe backlog of inventory compounded with the oversupply of containers is contributing to second-hand container market prices plummeting, according to analysis from Container xChange.\n\u201cThe current situation of oversupply of containers is a result of a series of reactionary market disruptions that began soon after the outbreak of the pandemic in early 2020. With the rise in demand, congestion at ports increased and the container capacity was held up for a considerably long period of time. This led to the panic ordering of new boxes at record levels. With time, as markets reopen and demand softens, the oversupply is a natural outcome of demand-supply forces\nWith inflation and lockdowns, disruptions will continue to change the equation between supply, demand and prices.\nbalancing at new levels,\u201d says Christian Roeloffs, co-founder and CEO of Container xChange.\nDisrupting 2023\nCurrently the industry is faced with several disruptions.\nFor starters, the Russia-Ukraine war doesn\u2019t seem to be ending any time soon.\n\u201cRussia cutting off gas supplies to many parts of Europe is greatly affecting the price of energy in Europe. Currently, Europe is facing 10% inflation as of September 2022. We will likely see inflation soar even further during the winter months. The increase in costs has resulted in companies in Europe either shifting their production to other parts of the world or reducing their output. In some cases, companies that cannot afford it had to close, or stop production entirely. These problems will not be an overnight fix and will surely continue to be an issue into the new year,\u201d says Woitzik.\nHeightened financial volatility, sustainable development divestment, complex global supply chain reconfigurations and mounting trade costs stemming from the war in Ukraine continue to impact trade and development, according to a new study released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).\n\u201cSoaring food and fuel prices will affect the most vulnerable in developing countries, putting pressure on the poorest households, which spend the highest share of their income on food, resulting in hardship and hunger,\u201d says UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan.\nIn fact, \u201cthe biggest trend to watch has to be the slowdown in the growth of global trade. Between 2005-2019, there was an 84% increase in global trade. Obviously, the pandemic had an immediate and (so far) lasting impact on that growth.

They can even track where their items are throughout the process until it arrives. This type of expectation of visibility and expediency is going to increase across the supply chain,\u201d says Jennifer Karpus-Romain, executive director for Transportation Marketing & Sales Association (TMSA).\nThe availability of ingredients and shortages in some food products continue to challenge the food sector, specifically the frozen food category.\n\u201cManufacturers may still need to reformulate or make labeling changes in response to ingredient shortages. The frozen food industry in particular is facing the diversion of soy and canola oil to make biofuels for government transportation subsidies and manufacturers face crisis-level shortages in edible vegetable oil for producing many frozen foods,\u201d says Alison Bodor, president and CEO at American Frozen Food Institute (AFFI).\nFurthermore, other disruptions such as inflation and labor shortages continue to put a damper on the industry.\n\u201cThe trucking industry is already plagued with driver shortages. Warehouses faced similar issues earlier this year and last year. Staffing complexities and labor shortages will be an ongoing trend next year as well,\u201d says Adhish Luitel, senior analyst, ABI Research. \u201cInflation has grown rapidly this year globally and a lot of regions in the world are now dealing with the highest level of inflation in years. Businesses must be prepared for cost increases related to procurement, finished products, wages, transportation\nDusan Kostic - stock.adobe.com\nfees, storage space rent and more. Coping with inflation and trying to minimize its impact would entail fixing a lot of inefficiencies across supply chains.\u201d\nAnd, it\u2019s those inefficiencies that could pose disruptions all on their own.\n\u201cAs we approach the end of 2022 and enter 2023, I anticipate a state of continued supply chain instability and disruptions for the next year, if not longer. Consequently, issues of accuracy in demand forecasting will continue to be a major pain point for retailers,\u201d says Troy Prothero, SVP, product management, supply chain solutions, SymphonyAI Retail CPG. \u201cFrom changes in purchasing and consumption patterns that resulted from the past two years to inflation and geopolitical events, all of these factors combined create a perfect storm for supply chain disruption. What\u2019s more, retailers can no longer rely solely on historical demand data as a basis for forecasting.\u201d\n\u201cAs a result, retailers must look to their demand forecasting technologies and ensure predictions are as agile, data-driven, science-based and accurate as possible,\u201d Prothero says. \u201cIn addition, it\u2019s crucial to proactively look at scenarios that might occur and plan how to act ahead of time, rather than just react to them.\u201d\nIndustry experts offer hope to a return to normalcy in the supply chain space, but it will be a new normalcy of sorts and be quite the bumpy ride in getting there.\n\u201cWe are right back to a threatened supply chain because we have not had the time to catch up and build needed resiliency,\u201d Madrecki says.

In the current job market, the winners are those who see the opportunity to invest in systems that require low human interaction. And even when human operators are required, the ergonomics of the system will determine the turnover rate.\nMontana-based Doyles Sheehan, a leading distributor to convenience stores, capitalized on the opportunity to reinvent the order fulfillment process. They teamed up with Velociti Alliance North America, a technology leader for optimized order fulfillment solutions, to convert their warehouses from single-order picking to hybrid order/batch picking. While some areas of the warehouse are picked one order at a time, most areas benefit from batch-oriented picking and sorting, where one pass through inventory fills an entire truckload of orders.\nThrough analysis and simulation of the Doyles Sheehan order history using 3-D models, Velociti was able to take their pick rate from 400 to 750 pieces per hour per employee. \u201cNot only did the Velociti partnership significantly decrease our labor requirement, but we also increased throughput and accuracy with minimal training. The bottom-line addition to profit is significant,\u201d says Pat Coulter, Director of Operations and Information Systems.\nUsing wearable technology, handsfree order selection, and cloud-based order optimization, Coulter has been able to achieve top-tier results without spending millions of dollars in automation. With Velociti, Doyles Sheehan has created more ergonomic jobs for a smaller staff of dedicated employees \u2013 people they can keep, because the work is manageable. With the labor savings, Coulter has been able to create incentives for highperforming associates, recognizing them for their dedication and ensuring that they stay engaged with the company for years to come.\nFor more information, head over to https://velocitialliance.com.\nTRENDS IN COLD CHAIN\nIf you had to choose a theme for 2022, its likely you would point toward supply chain disruption. For third-party logistics (3PL) providers who saw soaring rates and strong demand over the past two years, the market remains favorable long-term, but 2023 will look very different with a double-digit decline in revenues as the market normalizes, says Evan Armstrong, president of Armstrong & Associates.\nAnd while all signs point to a more stable market following the last few years of uncertainty, 3PLs are still likely to feel the impacts of that \u201cnew normal.\u201d\n1. Shippers are demanding a higher service level\nIndustry growth and increased service levels are the two biggest trends to look for in 2023, according to Chris Wilson, VP of business development at TA Services.\n\u201cBecause 2021-22 was kind of a recovery period of getting out of the supply chain and COVID nightmares, now we are seeing more companies move from being reactive to be more proactive,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cWe are seeing a lot of companies working a lot more with third parties, doing an integration of their\n@iQoncept.stock.adobe.com\nWhile all signs point to a more stable market following the last few years of uncertainty, 3PLs are still likely to feel the impacts of a New Normal.\nsupply chain with a third-party company as far as its transportation, its warehousing, its final mile, everything. Companies are relying on 3PLs a lot more than they used to.\u201d\nShippers are also looking for proactive ideas from 3PLs to improve operations and reduce costs, says Armstrong, and that \u201c3PL customers have evolved from wanting basic transportation and warehouse management skills to more strategic relationships. They are also looking at 3PLs for business continuity management and are seeking well-positioned 3PLs which can even operate in cases of disasters. Some customers are asking 3PLs to present their internal plans for labor shortages, disaster preparedness, work stoppage, weather-related transportation disruptions, technology outages and other risks to operations.\u201d Wilson notes that it\u2019s no longer just about price, but what you can bring to the table. \u201cIt\u2019s about positioning yourself to have the most options and the best options,\u201d he explains. Drew Herpich, chief commercial officer at Nolan Transportation Group and Transportation Insight, attributes the continued growth in the 3PL market to a level playing field. \u201cPeople are now starting to accept brokers on the same level as assets. Brokers for so long got a bad name out in the industry, and shippers have realized, especially after COVID, that brokers have similar capabilities as these assets do,\u201d Herpich adds.\n2. 3PLs must be flexible\nShippers are also looking for 3PLs that have the flexibility to bend and sway as the market changes. \u201cYou can no\n\uf152 Cold chain and dry warehousing capacity\nis tight and will continue to be a challenge throughout 2023.\nlonger take the approach of, \u2018this is who we are, and this is how we do it.\u2019 You have to be able to pivot and adjust to each individual customer,\u201d Wilson explains.\nHe adds that shippers are looking for an \u201celastic logistics plan,\u201d with a partner \u201cthat can look at the overall picture and offer options.\u201d\nThis type of flexibility requires IT integration with transparency and visibility into both yours and your customers\u2019 systems, \u201cso that they\u2019re able to know in real-time everything that is going on with their supply chain and that the 3PL is handling it,\u201d says Wilson.\n3. A continued crunch on warehouse capacity\nCold chain and dry warehousing capacity is tight and will continue to be a challenge throughout 2023 as shippers look to 3PLs to find space and manage operations.\n\u201cFinding and managing warehouse and\n@bnenin.stock.adobe.com\ntransportation labor is another challenge and risk that is being passed on to 3PLs,\u201d explains Armstrong.\nWilson says that 3PLs are being asked to take more product in and have more stock available, so if and when there are supply chain disruptions, the stock is readily available. However, this has created a major crunch on warehousing space.\nIn response, Herpich predicts the industry will see an increase in mergers and acquisitions this year among the biggest players.\n\u201cBeing able to build or get the equipment or space to be able to build these refrigerated solutions is going to be tougher. To get the on-demand warehousing, you\u2019re going to see a lot more M&A deals going down,\u201d he says.\n4. Labor shortage is growing\nWilson says a labor shortage across the supply chain is likely to be an even bigger problem for 3PLs this year.\nAccording to an annual study by NTT\nFROMVINETOMARKET\nGetting perishables to the market in excellent condition is a tough job. But with our help, it\u2019s a little easier. With a fleet of more than1,40053-foot refrigerated trailers and containers,Alliance Shippers Inc. has the capacity to manage the largest protective-service tasks.

This also tracks with the findings in the study, which found 84% of 3PLs and 70% of shippers are either actively implementing or researching and reviewing augmenting their supply chain operations with new technology and/or automation to offset talent shortage.\n5. Rates will trend downward\nRecipient of Food Logistics\u2019 2022 Top Software & Technology Providers Award\nEnd-to-End Visibility Shipper - Carrier Matching\nAs disruptions in the supply chain continue to resolve, Wilson predicts rates trending downward. While general freight volume is currently muted and rates for most modes are down significantly from the first half of 2022, Armstrong says more historically normal transportation rates and demand levels should progress into 2023.\nThis means that price will no longer be the biggest differentiator in a competitive 3PL landscape.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking to work with a new customer, everyone\u2019s rates are going down into the ground right now. Its more about providing a service level and finding other services that provide a value-add for the customer,\u201d Wilson says.\nTo that point, Armstrong says that value-added warehousing and distribution will continue to do well given the general lack of warehousing space, which is nearing a critical level in the cold chain and strong growth in e-commerce fulfillment and last-mile delivery.\nReal-Time Tracking\nAutomation & Efficiency Instant Reports\nCustomer Support & Relationship\nJoin Our Community WWW.LANEZ.COM\n6. Digital freight matching takes focus\nDigital freight matching will continue to pick up speed in 2023, with an increased focus on the automation of freight brokerage. This process automates traditional spot-market freight brokerage sales functions, and according to Armstrong, is increasing shippers\u2019 use of more spot vs. contract pricing.\n\u201cThe ongoing digitalization of transactional truckload freight brokerage continues at a rapid pace as more 3PLs have built API integrations to large shippers\u2019 transportation management systems for truckload spot-market rate quoting and automated load tendering and booking,\u201d says Armstrong, adding that it has become a competitive differentiator as 3PLs look to increase the number of loads and shipments they manage per person per day and revenue per person per year.\n7. Sustainability will demand a bigger role\nSustainability will also be top of mind for many 3PLs this year. \u201cThe solutions that we see today have not been exactly environmentally friendly or sustainable long term. You\u2019re going to see much more sustainable solutions come to the forefront,\u201d Herpich says. Wilson points to green initiatives in the warehouse, specifically mentioning major grocery chains who in recent years have announced plans to reduce emissions, cut their carbon footprints and create greater efficiencies in the warehouse. Lighting and temperature control are the two biggest areas companies are focusing on in the warehouse, with energy efficiency found through LED lights, skylights, sensors that monitor usage and turn off lights when not in use and highefficiency HVAC systems.\n8. Innovative cold storage solutions are needed\nAs warehouse capacity continues to tighten, Herpich says 3PLs will need to get more creative in keeping products cold.\n\u201cYou are going to see people get more and more creative if they don\u2019t actually have a cold storage warehouse,\u201d Herpich says, adding that you\u2019re also going to see more \u201cfrom a packaging standpoint in being able to keep things cool because at the end of the day, the insurance and the claims can be costly if you don\u2019t do it the right way.\u201d\n9. Last-mile logistics remain a challenge\nWhile interest in grocery delivery was already growing pre-pandemic, it is now the preferred method of grocery shopping for many consumers.\n\u201cThere was a small niche of people who did home delivery of grocery, but that market has blossomed,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cEvery major chain is now partnering with some sort of home delivery service. In the beginning, they would send a shopper to the store to fulfill the delivery, and now it\u2019s working out of warehouses. Now, they\u2019ve pivoted that there are warehouses just for that at-home delivery.\u201d\n10. Demand for reverse logistics will grow\n3PLs place a lack of importance on reverse logistics, but considering the growing size of the market, it is suggested 3PLs may be missing out on \u201cthe untapped potential of reverse logistics to their overall growth and customer loyalty.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nAMY WUNDERLIN\nfreelance writer\nTHE LEADER IN TEMPERATURECONTROLLED LOGISTICS\nBuilding trust through outstanding performance\nWarehouse Solutions | Transportation Solutions Brokerage Solutions | CES Solutions\n908-351-2800 | EastCoastWarehouse.com\nTOP SOFTWARE & TECH PROVIDERS AWARD: VISIBILITY, SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT LEAD THE WAY\nIn February 2020, MIT Management Sloan School predicted that machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced analytics would be the top supply chain technologies set to deliver the most competitive advantage.

& Risk Management Platform\nINSURANCE COVERAGE AMID SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES\nConsumers today expect to get what they want when they want it\u2014whether it\u2019s ordering something online that can be delivered in a few days or going to the grocery store to shop fully stocked shelves. However, the COVID-19 pandemic changed all of that. It exposed the vulnerabilities of the global supply chain and logistics companies to quickly adapt to continue to move products and goods throughout the world.\nOver the last two years, while some businesses have become experts in shipping logistics, others have been pushed outside of their comfort zones to find alternate ways to get their products to market. This inconvenience unfortunately created more challenges and issues for businesses such as increased costs, elevated inventory and evolving risks.\nSupply chain efficiency is essential in business, and delays and bottlenecks are friction points for an already stressed supply chain. While many factors contribute to supply chain issues, the main ones are demand, material supply, bottlenecks and labor shortages.\nBottlenecks and shipping delays\nPort inefficiencies are a major cause of the supply chain bottleneck. If ships get held up at a port or can\u2019t unload cargo quickly, the delay has a rippling effect on the supply chain. Some ports are investing in newer equipment like environmentally friendly autonomous cranes to help improve efficiency. However, it will take more than a year for these cranes to be built and delivered, which means the ports will continue to face logjams. Although these investments in port infrastructure have been happening, it has not been able to keep pace with the growth in size of container ships and demand during COVID-19.\nShipping and logistics problems\nAside from delays, businesses face unique risks and other problems with shipping such as costs, lost cargo, environmental regulations, damaged cargo and goods and world events like political unrest. It is important to remember that it is not just the product owner that faces these risks. Logistics companies are also exposed to various liability risks.\nTypically, companies rely on ocean freight to transport goods. In fact, the majority of global trade goes through ocean vessel because the cost for air freight is exponentially more than shipping by sea. The other big difference between ocean and air freight is speed. Shipping goods on a plane means they will reach their destination faster than traveling by sea. Because of this, using a cargo plane is generally reserved for more expensive goods or perishable products.\nHowever, when supply chains were significantly delayed and disrupted during the height of the pandemic, some businesses were unable to rely on air freight because of cost, storage space and weight. A shipping container can be 20- or 40-feet long and can hold a lot of materials. With air cargo, goods are traveling by pallet. The physics of a plane can\u2019t hold the same amount of weight as a shipping container. Unfortunately, it is not possible to just flip a switch and immediately start using air freight.\nInsurance to help protect supply chain\nGiven the delays and issues in the supply chain, businesses and logistics shipping companies face unique risks. Although some of these risks were present before the pandemic, alternative measures for freight travel can create new exposures. If a company decides to charter their own vessel instead of working with a logistics shipping company, they are entering into a different agreement. It is a channel they would not normally go through, so they must think about the risks involved. It is why businesses need to make sure their insurance coverage is up to date.\nAs countries reopened, demand skyrocketed and manufacturers could not re-open quickly enough to meet this increase.\nKARLA SCOTT\nsenior managing director, ocean marine,\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nCLIVE NIX\ntransport and marine liability underwriter, international, The Hartford\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nThe Hartford\nYESTERDAY WAS THE TIME TO START NEARSHORING\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, companies around the world have been struggling to rebuild their global supply chains, both in terms of finding suppliers to deliver the key parts needed in their manufacturing and/or delivering end products to their customers.\nFood Logistics\u2019 editor-in-chief Marina Mayer sat down with Michele Porrino Perassi, executive director of World Trade Center San Luis Potosi in Mexico, to talk about post-COVID-19 pandemic challenges for maritime and air cargo, logistics challenges deriving from e-commerce and how nearshoring is an option for U.S. and Latin American companies to reconfigure their global value chains.\nFood Logistics: What does the state of the supply chain look like next year and in the years ahead?\nMichele Porrino Perassi: Since we are an industrial park in Mexico, very close to the U.S. market, offering exceptional services for any business wishing to expand or start operations, the logistic challenges during the pandemic are generating many opportunities for us. The \u201cnearshoring effect\u201d is a real thing. Companies are approaching us and other industrial parks to reduce logistics risks and increase logistics efficiency. Historically, the goal for manufacturing companies was zero inventory. The pandemic has changed that thinking. Now, many companies are trying to relocate all their manufacturing capacity from Asia. In some cases, when that\u2019s not possible, they are relocating part of their capacity. And in other cases, companies cannot relocate manufacturing but can substantially increase their safety stock. These measures are helping, but they won\u2019t reduce logistical challenges immediately. Even with just increasing safety stocks, you need warehouses, and there aren't enough in North America. The current vacancy rate in warehouses in Canada, the U.S., and\n@donvictori0l.stock.adobe.com\nMexico are close to 0%. This process will take time. I believe it will take 1-2 years for companies to get to safer performance.\nFood Logistics: Explain the importance of logistic hubs in relation to ports and distribution centers.\nPorrino Perassi: It makes sense to relocate a business to a logistic hub to have different ways to access the market so you can be more efficient. For example, companies located in WTC Premium Industrial Park in San Luis Potos\u00ed, Mexico, have access to a good rail service connecting to truck routes in Mexico and the U.S. and a free trade zone that makes making and receiving shipments easier in an international environment. Our city also has a strong, established supply chain, making logistics very efficient. Being part of a global network such as the WTCA is extremely beneficial because there are over 300 WTC locations in over 100 countries.\nFood Logistics: Explain some of the postCOVID-19 pandemic challenges for maritime and air cargo and what\u2019s in store for 2023.\nPorrino Perassi: Companies must be more creative. That may be finding better, more efficient routes. It could also be using combined processes (having part of your manufacturing done in Asia, part of it done in Mexico and part close to your market). You can also have some manufacturing done on the road (by rail, etc.) Looking years ahead, by using technology, such as 3D printing, companies may be able to have manufacturing done on-site and in real-time wherever they are located.\nFood Logistics: Explain some of the logistics challenges deriving from e-commerce.\nPorrino Perassi: E-commerce has been increasing exponentially, and there are many challenges: lack of warehouse space, a shortage of drivers, dealing with reverse logistics (consumers returning items). I\u2019m convinced that companies need to build a relationship with consumers and be able to suggest and explain more efficient ways to supply merchandise. There\u2019s a lot of technology available that can enhance the experience for the customer while also improving logistics efficiently, and at the same time, taking care of the environment because that\u2019s critical.\nSCAN QR CODE\nFor the complete article\nHOW NFTS CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO SUPPLY CHAINS\n@denisismagilov.stock.adobe.com\nIt\u2019s no secret that global supply chains are under duress. Since the onset of the pandemic, the increase in consumer demand paired with product and labor shortages have tested the current processes and technologies in place.\nSupply chains are in need of a technology re-set, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a useful tool to digitize, track and trace items. NFTs can be used for authentication to transfer ownership rights and to store data that\u2019s verifiable on blockchains. With the average product moving through many touchpoints on its journey to a consumer, an NFT can be paired with that product and used to record, verify and report each touchpoint. Ownership of that NFT can be transferred as the product changes hands to the eventual purchaser. The implementation of NFTs into supply chains at large could enable warehouses, manufacturers and consumers to better understand and refine the product journey. Here are a few examples of how they can be integrated:\nConsumer transparency and certification\nSupply chain disruptions, combined with a growing consumer interest in sustainable and ethically sourced products, have made it more important to give consumers a clearer understanding into where things come from and how each step in a product\u2019s journey impacts the environment.\nNFTs can be used as \u201cdigital twins\u201d of products to verify and track items as they go from raw materials to an item in a consumer\u2019s hands. Not only does this implementation give a purchaser a verifiable certificate of ownership, it can also give consumers insights into sustainable practices in supply chains. Digital twin NFTs can also be used for connecting consumers to brands as the means to unlock exclusive perks and post purchase promotions.\nFor sellers, it\u2019s important to note that when customers accept digital twin NFTs, the seller can then see and take note of the customers\u2019 wallet addresses. This provides a valuable anchor for addressing customers, even across different environments like brick-and-mortar stores, online shops, IoT kiosks or public events. Sellers can issue promotions or solicitations to these addresses and have a much stronger connection to customers than if they just had their email or mailing addresses.\nTraceability\nTracking and tracing the movement and quality of goods as they flow through the supply chain has been an ongoing challenge for companies, manufacturers and supply chain professionals, as well as consumers. Digital twin NFTs have the ability to provide real-time tracking and verifiable records into the environmental and social impact and overall quality of goods.\nFor companies moving large amounts of inventory, digital twin NFTs can be leveraged to track and trace individual items or shipments. This could be especially useful with items where multiple checkpoints and authorizations are required along the way.\nAnother example is with food and beverage distribution. Food distribution requires temperature controls and checks at multiple locations to ensure quality for consumers and to prevent food waste. Digital twin NFTs give consumers, distributors and manufacturers a non-fungible record of the supply chain journey to ensure the quality of perishable items.\nData insights\nThese NFTs can also provide easy visibility into not just where items are located but also the history of various components, information on manufacturing steps and more. As supply chain leaders and technologists seek to better understand and pinpoint logistical challenges, NFTs\u2019 ability to store data using smart contracts on blockchains provides all parties with a verifiable retrospect into product journeys.\nPaving the way to adoption\nWhile supply chains are poised to benefit from the adoption of NFTs, there are many common roadblocks to implementing them into legacy supply chain systems.\nFirst is the high transaction costs associated with modifying or transferring NFTs on some blockchains. Transaction fees need to be nearly free for all high-volume businesses, otherwise they can\u2019t be justified. Implementation expense is another concern. Point of sale and distribution companies involved in new standards have a hard enough time supporting an additional REST endpoint, let alone running a blockchain \u201cvalidator\u201d node. However, this is changing as more source code packages and cloud based one-click solutions become available.\nOverall, we are still in the early stages of utilizing NFTs to better our supply chains. The good news is that there is an appetite for transparency, traceability and trust .\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nJULIEN GENESTOUX\nfounder and CEO,\nUnlock\nHOW A VIRTUAL TWIN CHANGES THE COLD FOODS PACKAGING GAME\nPackaging design engineers\u2014 especially for food products\u2014will say that developing an attractive, functional design to promote a brand involves many factors. Whether designing a bottle, carton, box or other form, exact requirements call for applying a combination of creativity and science.\nProtecting food from elements (light, moisture, air and even pathogens like bacteria) and ensuring package integrity means goods arrive safely in stores. Consider developing the packaging for delicate \u00e9clairs, for instance. The \u00e9clair packaging must entice the consumer in the store and the pastry must taste good after purchase. To add more complexity, consumer packaged goods companies with razor-thin profit margins must not only keep packaging costs down, but also strive to meet sustainability goals.\nComplicating packaging decisions further, new regulations require manufacturers to phase out single-use plastics, Styrofoam, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and other bisphenol A (BPA)-laden polymers. Instead, packaging designers now use eco-friendly alternatives (like bamboo, rice husk and even mushroom fiber) and responsibly-sourced paper. How do manufacturers meet all specifications with minimal design iterations while mitigating the risk of damaged products or product recalls?\nTo ensure success in achieving these goals, engineers must start with simulation and the virtual twin to make the right decisions.\n@petunyia.stock.adobe.com\nAcross-the-board packaging success\nTo meet growing customer demand, companies are looking for ways to bring products to market more quickly. One option is to eliminate traditional prototyping methods in favor of 3D\nsimulation software by applying a virtual twin of packaging designs to define the optimal balance of strength, size and performance in the shortest time possible.\nAlso analyze how packaging would withstand temperature extremes and high humidity over extended periods without expensive environmental chambers and lengthy testing.\nBecause the virtual twin allows users to simulate these and countless other variables, optimizing a product or package design takes hours rather than weeks or even months. There are no physical prototypes to build and discard when testing design options.\nCool tech for cold temps\nWhen a global leader in convenience foods and beverages needed similar capabilities, it employed 3D simulation on a virtual twin of its beverage packaging. The company\u2019s blow molding department sought to identify what processing parameters would provide the best wall thickness in stretch blow molded and extrusion blow molded beverage bottles. Through end-to-end simulation, the beverage maker eliminated its previous trial-and-error approach to bottle design. In addition, packaging engineers at the company have begun using simulation to perform feasibility studies on recycled plastics and paper beverage packaging, each aimed at reducing carbon footprints. The company now enjoys newfound cost reductions and improved sustainability.\nSustainable directions\nThe drive to meet sustainability requirements to support a lower carbon footprint and a more circular economy continues to grow by the year.\nPackaging manufacturers of all kinds can do more with recycled plastics or switch to environmentally friendly materials. Meeting this challenge in an efficient, cost-effective manner via 3D simulation tools and a virtual twin allows companies to define the best fit, form and function for packagin\u2014without physical prototypes.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nADRIAN WOOD\nstrategic business development director,\nDassault Syst\u00e8mes\nPEST MANAGEMENT TIPS FOR COLDER WEATHER\nThe winter season can serve as an open invitation into business for pests that don\u2019t go dormant during the colder months. These critters will be searching for food and shelter and your building will look good to them. Supply chain facilities can be a weak link where pests can contaminate goods.\nHere are the most problematic pests threatening to put a kink in your food and supply chain during this time of year.\nRodents. Along with the danger of possibly sparking a fire, these pests bring health-related threats. They are associated with numerous potentially serious health hazards, including typhus, food poisoning and hantavirus. Rodents can contaminate products through droppings and other biohazardous body wastes.\nCockroaches. These stubborn pests thrive in heated buildings during the winter. Oriental cockroaches enter by crawling through gaps or openings in the foundation. American cockroaches follow sewage lines and plumbing into boiler rooms or utility rooms. And German cockroaches can hitch a free ride inside through shipments, bags and even clothing.\nBirds. Birds like pigeons, house sparrows and starlings may carry a variety of pathogens that can be transferred to humans and products. For example, dust from dried-out bird feathers and droppings, carrying pathogens, could be inhaled.\nAnts. Pavement ants and odorous house ants are two species that may establish colonies under foundations or slabs yearround. As a result, they sometimes appear inside structures even in the wintertime when other insects are not active. When ants are seen indoors in the winter, it will most likely be near sources of heat and moisture. These could be where plumbing and utilities penetrate slabs.\nFlies. There are two major groups of pest flies that can affect facilities. Fruit flies, drain flies and phorid flies are in the first group. These flies establish populations within the facility and breed in unsanitary places as floor drains, septic soil beneath slabs, sewage ejector pits and sumps. House flies and blow flies are among the filth flies and are known to be active in the late winter or early spring. They normally live and breed outside in excrement, garbage or animal carcasses.\nFortunately there are many steps to help prevent pests from threatening the cold food chain. 1. Identify popular pest areas early. If you can identify the key areas they will gravitate to ahead of time, you can address them before pests are introduced. Common hotspots include storage rooms, delivery areas, utility rooms, break rooms and trash areas. 2. Look for evidence. Once you\u2019ve identified the areas, monitor them frequently for activity. Look for damage to packaging and food, droppings and obvious entry points. If you notice anything, log it immediately. 3. Seal any openings. Pests love to sneak into buildings through cracks and gaps. Cockroaches, ants, flies and spiders are especially skilled at entering this way. Do an assessment of your siding and foundation and repair where needed. Seal any gaps between doors and windows with caulk, ensure weather stripping is in place and undamaged and replace any damaged screens in windows. 4. Clean and sanitize. Clean up spills and crumbs as soon as possible. Keep storage areas and utility closets clean and tidy and avoid unnecessary clutter (particularly cardboard). Instruct employees not to consume food or leave food wrappers and bags in operational areas. Clear your drains of buildup/ 5. Deal with smells. Bad smells naturally occur near and around trash areas and dumpsters. Neutralize the smells or add a pleasant scent.\nWith staff training, diligent maintenance, cleaning practices and the help of a pest management provider, you can help keep facilities pest-free during the winter months and every season after.\nromul014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR NICOLAS ELLIS technical specialist, Western Pest Services\nMARCH 20-23, 2023 MCCORMICK PLACE CHICAGO, IL\npromatshow.com\nsupply chains explored\nWith over 900 of the world\u2019s leading manufacturing and supply chain solution providers under one roof, you can see firsthand what the future holds \u2013 and find the tools you need to shockproof your operations and move your business forward.

According to a study by Inbound Logistics, shipping expenses can account for up to 13% of a business's total costs. By reducing shipping costs, businesses can lower their overall expenses, enhance competitiveness in their industry, and increase profit margins. Additionally, lower shipping costs enable companies to offer more competitive pricing to their customers, potentially leading to increased sales and customer loyalty.\nOne effective method to reduce shipping costs is to negotiate better rates with carriers. Leveraging shipping volume allows businesses to secure lower rates, resulting in significant cost savings. Another strategy is to optimize packaging and shipping methods. Using the appropriate packaging materials and methods can reduce package size and weight, leading to lower shipping costs.\nReducing shipping costs also positively impacts the environment. Optimizing packaging and shipping methods can reduce a company's carbon footprint, contributing to a more sustainable future. This sustainability effort can also appeal to environmentally conscious customers, who may prefer companies that prioritize green practices.\nAnalyzing Shipping Costs: Identifying Areas for Improvement\nAssessing Current Shipping Methods and Expenses\nThe first step in reducing shipping costs is to thoroughly evaluate current shipping methods and expenses. Analyze shipping data to identify areas where costs can be cut. This analysis may reveal opportunities such as reducing shipment frequency, consolidating orders to minimize the number of shipments, or adjusting packaging to decrease weight and size.\nComparing Shipping Carriers\nAnother critical aspect of cost analysis is evaluating the shipping carriers being used. Different carriers offer varying rates and services, so it's essential to compare and select the most cost-effective option for your business needs. Additionally, negotiating rates based on shipping volume with carriers can lead to substantial cost savings. Regularly reviewing and adjusting carrier agreements ensures that businesses continue to optimize their shipping strategies over time.\nStrategies to Reduce Shipping Costs\nNegotiating Shipping Rates with Carriers\nNegotiating shipping rates is a powerful strategy for businesses aiming to reduce costs. This negotiation can involve bundling shipments, agreeing to long-term contracts, or leveraging volume discounts. Understanding your shipping needs and the carrier's pricing structure allows businesses to negotiate favorable rates effectively. It's crucial to revisit carrier agreements periodically, especially as business needs evolve, to maintain or further reduce shipping expenses.\nOptimizing Packaging and Labeling Processes\nEfficient packaging and labeling processes can significantly impact shipping costs. By streamlining these processes and utilizing effective packaging materials, businesses can decrease the weight and size of shipments, leading to lower shipping fees and reduced environmental impact. Implementing labeling automation can also speed up the process and minimize errors, further reducing costs.\nUse appropriate packaging materials: Choose materials that protect products without adding unnecessary weight or size.\nImplement labeling automation: Automate labeling to improve accuracy and efficiency.\nAdopt a barcode system: Use barcodes to track inventory and ensure correct packaging and labeling.\nLeveraging Technology to Optimize Shipping Operations\nTechnology plays a crucial role in optimizing shipping operations and reducing costs. Utilizing shipping software can automate various processes, including carrier selection, labeling, and tracking. Implementing such technology helps businesses identify shipping inefficiencies, such as delays and errors, allowing for quick corrective actions. Real-time shipment tracking through GPS and advanced technologies keeps both businesses and customers informed about the status of orders, enhancing transparency and satisfaction.\nFurthermore, analyzing shipping data through technology provides valuable insights into trends and patterns. These insights help businesses make informed decisions regarding carrier selection, packaging, and other aspects of shipping operations, leading to considerable cost savings and improved efficiency.\nFor more information on choosing the right shipping software, refer to UPS Shipping Software Solutions.\nImplementing a Returns Management Policy\nReturns management can be a significant expense, particularly concerning shipping costs. Developing a returns management policy that minimizes returns and reduces associated shipping expenses can help businesses save money. Strategies may include providing detailed product information, enforcing stricter return policies, or charging customers for return shipping.\nCollaborating with logistics providers that offer discounted rates for returns can further reduce expenses. Additionally, utilizing fulfillment centers closer to customers can decrease shipping distances and costs, enhancing overall efficiency and profitability.\nAdvanced Techniques for Reducing Shipping Costs\nOutsourcing Shipping Operations\nOutsourcing shipping operations to third-party logistics providers (3PLs) can offer significant cost savings by leveraging their expertise and economies of scale in shipping. This approach allows businesses to scale shipping capacity based on demand without the need for additional resources or equipment. However, it is essential to consider the potential trade-offs, such as reduced control over the shipping process, which may lead to delays or other issues.\nMaximizing Discounts and Rebates\nCarriers often provide discounts and rebates that businesses can capitalize on to lower shipping costs. Understanding and maximizing these programs involves negotiating better discounts or taking advantage of seasonal promotions. Regularly reviewing carrier discount programs ensures that businesses are fully benefiting from available incentives.\nTracking and Monitoring Shipping Expenses\nEffective tracking and monitoring of shipping expenses are vital for identifying ongoing cost reduction opportunities. Utilizing data analytics and key performance indicators (KPIs) allows businesses to gain insights into their shipping operations and pinpoint specific areas where costs can be minimized. Tools like Logistics KPIs can provide valuable metrics for continuous improvement.\nReducing International Shipping Costs\nInternational shipping presents unique challenges and can be costly. To reduce international shipping costs, businesses should consider using less expensive carriers, optimizing packaging for international transit, or leveraging free trade agreements where applicable. It is also crucial to be aware of potential pitfalls such as customs fees and unexpected taxes, which can inflate shipping expenses. Properly navigating the complexities of international shipping can lead to significant cost savings and broader market reach.\nBuilding Strong Relationships with Carriers\nEstablishing and maintaining strong relationships with shipping carriers can yield various perks and benefits that contribute to cost reductions. Long-term partnerships often result in more competitive pricing, priority service, and access to additional services. Effective communication and collaboration with carriers ensure that businesses receive the best possible terms, further enhancing cost-efficiency and service quality.\nEvaluating the ROI of Shipping Cost Reduction Strategies\nAssessing the return on investment (ROI) of shipping cost reduction strategies is essential for prioritizing initiatives that offer the most significant financial benefits. While some strategies may require an initial investment, such as implementing technology or outsourcing shipping operations, they can provide substantial cost savings over time. Conducting ROI analysis helps businesses make informed decisions about where to allocate resources to maximize savings and improve operational efficiency.\nConclusion\nReducing shipping costs is a critical component of running a successful business. By evaluating shipping methods, selecting the right carriers, negotiating favorable rates, and implementing efficient processes, businesses can significantly lower expenses and enhance customer service. Additionally, leveraging technology, monitoring shipping expenses, and fostering strong carrier relationships can lead to substantial cost savings. Ultimately, a comprehensive strategy for reducing shipping costs not only improves a company's bottom line but also boosts its competitive position in the industry.\nAbout the Author\nAnthony Robinson is the CEO of ShipScience, a pioneering company dedicated to helping e-commerce leaders optimize their shipping decisions, reduce costs, and automate tedious processes.

With online shopping becoming increasingly popular, efficient and cost-effective order fulfillment has become a top priority for businesses aiming to stay relevant and successful.\nThe Importance of Reducing Shipping Costs for Ecommerce Businesses\nShipping costs can significantly impact the profit margin of an ecommerce business. Elevated shipping expenses often result in higher product prices, making it more challenging to attract price-conscious customers. For small businesses, this can severely affect their bottom line and erode customer loyalty. By reducing shipping costs, ecommerce businesses can remain cost-competitive, increase customer satisfaction, and drive higher sales.\nEffective strategies for reducing shipping costs include:\nNegotiating favorable rates with shipping carriers to take advantage of volume discounts and establish long-term relationships.\nOptimizing product packaging by using smaller and lighter materials to decrease shipment weight and size.\nImplementing efficient order fulfillment processes to minimize handling time and reduce associated costs.\nLeveraging technology such as automation and shipping software to enhance efficiency and accuracy.\nReducing shipping costs also benefits the environment.

Additionally, offering free or reduced shipping options encourages customers to consolidate orders, further decreasing the environmental impact of ecommerce shipping.\nAnalyzing Your Current Shipping Costs: Identifying Areas for Improvement\nBefore taking steps to reduce shipping costs, it's crucial to analyze current shipping processes. Identifying areas for improvement in fulfillment is essential for achieving cost savings. This includes examining packaging costs, shipping rates, return handling, and tracking the time required to process and ship orders.\nKey areas to consider include:\nDistance: Evaluate the distance between your warehouse and customers.

Some carriers offer discounted rates for bulk orders, which can be leveraged for cost savings.\nWhen comparing shipping rates, consider the following factors:\nShipping Time and Delivery Options: Assess the balance between cost and delivery speed to meet both business needs and customer expectations.\nAdditional Services: Look for value-added services such as package tracking, insurance, and easy returns that can enhance the customer experience.\nCarrier Reliability: Evaluate carrier reliability and service quality to ensure timely and accurate deliveries.\nNegotiating with Carriers: Strategies for Lowering Shipping Costs\nEcommerce businesses can lower shipping costs by negotiating with shipping carriers. Strategies include:\nRequesting Bulk Shipment Discounts: Leverage your shipping volume to negotiate better rates with carriers.\nRenegotiating Contract Terms: Revisit contract terms periodically to ensure you are receiving the best possible rates and services.\nSwitching Carriers: Explore alternative carriers that may offer more competitive rates or better service terms.\nLeveraging data and analytics during negotiations can be highly effective. Analyzing shipping data helps businesses identify areas for optimization, such as frequent shipping routes where lower rates can be negotiated. Additionally, using data to inform negotiations can lead to better terms like shorter delivery times or more flexible pickup options.\nImplementing Order Fulfillment Strategies to Lower Shipping Costs\nEfficient order fulfillment can significantly reduce shipping costs. Key strategies include:\nOptimizing Packaging: Minimize space and weight to reduce shipment costs.\nSegmenting Orders: Categorize orders by weight, size, and destination to choose the most cost-effective shipping method for each order.\nNegotiating Carrier Rates: Leverage shipping volume to negotiate better rates with carriers.\nRegularly Reviewing Shipping Options: Continually assess shipping rates and carrier options to ensure the best possible deals.\nManaging Returns and Exchanges: Reducing the Cost of Reverse Logistics\nReturns and exchanges are inevitable in the ecommerce industry. Efficient handling of these processes can result in significant cost savings in reverse logistics. Key strategies include:\nClear Return Policies: Establish transparent and straightforward return policies to streamline the return process.\nStreamlined Return Processes: Implement efficient processes for handling returns and exchanges to minimize operational costs.\nRestocking Fees: Consider implementing restocking fees to offset the costs of returned items.\nAdditionally, minimizing the number of returns and exchanges through detailed product descriptions, high-quality images, and informative videos can help customers make informed purchasing decisions. Providing robust customer support via chatbots or live chat can address questions and concerns before purchases, reducing the likelihood of returns and associated costs.\nThe Role of Packaging in Reducing Shipping Costs for Ecommerce Businesses\nPackaging is a critical area for reducing shipping costs. Effective packaging strategies include:\nUsing Lightweight Materials: Employ lightweight packaging materials to decrease shipping weight and costs.\nOptimizing Packaging Size: Design packaging to fit products snugly, minimizing excess space and reducing dimensional weight charges.\nSkip Packaging: Utilize original manufacturer packaging when possible to eliminate additional packing steps and materials.\nEco-Friendly Materials: Incorporate biodegradable plastics or recycled cardboard to achieve cost savings and enhance environmental sustainability.\nAutomated Packaging Systems: Implement automated systems to streamline the packaging process, reducing labor costs and increasing efficiency.\nLeverage Technology: Using Automation and Software to Reduce Shipping Costs\nAutomation and software solutions are powerful tools for reducing shipping costs, especially for businesses with large order volumes. Key technological strategies include:\nAutomating Shipping Label Printing: Streamline the shipping label creation process to save time and reduce errors.\nOrder Management Software: Utilize software to track shipments, manage inventory, and minimize shipping process inefficiencies.\nData Analytics: Analyze shipping data to identify cost-saving opportunities, such as optimizing shipping routes or selecting more cost-effective carriers.\nCustomer Communication Tools: Provide real-time shipment updates to reduce customer service inquiries and improve satisfaction.\nCustomer Shipping Options: Offer customers the ability to choose their own shipping preferences, increasing control over shipping costs and enhancing customer loyalty.\nUtilizing Third-Party Logistics Providers to Lower Shipping Costs for Your Ecommerce Business\nThird-party logistics providers (3PLs) can help businesses reduce shipping costs by offering cost-efficient shipping solutions.

Each option has its advantages and disadvantages:\nFree Shipping:\nPros: Highly attractive to customers, can serve as a strong marketing tool, potentially increasing conversion rates.\nCons: Can be costly for businesses, may erode profit margins if not managed properly.\nDiscounted Shipping:\nPros: Maintains a degree of profitability while offering competitive shipping rates, attracts price-sensitive customers.\nCons: Might not be as compelling as free shipping, may require careful calculation to ensure costs are covered.\nHow to Optimize Your Supply Chain to Reduce Shipping Costs\nOptimizing the supply chain is crucial for minimizing shipping costs. Strategies include:\nStreamlining Procurement: Simplify the procurement process to reduce costs and improve efficiency.\nEliminating Supply Chain Inefficiencies: Identify and address inefficiencies within the supply chain that drive up shipping expenses.\nPartnering with Suppliers and Carriers: Establish partnerships that result in mutually beneficial agreements, leading to cost reductions for both parties.\nTips for Managing International Shipping Costs for Your Ecommerce Business\nInternational shipping presents additional challenges and costs for ecommerce businesses.

The two most common options are ground shipping and economy shipping. This guide explores the differences between these two options to help you make an informed decision.\nUnderstanding Ground Shipping\nGround shipping is the most prevalent shipping method in the United States, involving the transportation of packages over land. Major carriers like UPS, FedEx, and USPS handle this service.\nAdvantages of Ground Shipping\nReliability: Managed by well-established carriers, ensuring timely and secure delivery.\nCost-Effectiveness: Generally more affordable than air or sea shipping, making it suitable for regular or bulk shipments.\nVariety of Services: Options include express shipping, same-day delivery, and guaranteed delivery times.\nDisadvantages of Ground Shipping\nHigher Costs: More expensive compared to economy shipping due to faster and more reliable service.\nEnvironmental Impact: Although more sustainable than air shipping, it still contributes to carbon emissions.\nExploring Economy Shipping\nEconomy shipping is a budget-friendly option ideal for businesses aiming to reduce shipping costs. Carriers offering this service include FedEx SmartPost, DHL eCommerce, and USPS Mail Innovations.\nAdvantages of Economy Shipping\nAffordability: Lower shipping costs make it ideal for non-urgent deliveries.\nEnvironmental Benefits: Optimized routes and combined transportation methods reduce carbon footprint.\nTracking Available: Most economy services provide tracking information for monitoring shipments.\nDisadvantages of Economy Shipping\nSlower Delivery: Delivery times typically range from 3 to 10 business days.\nLimited Services: Fewer options for expedited delivery and special handling compared to ground shipping.\nKey Factors Affecting Shipping Rates\nSeveral factors influence the cost of shipping, whether you choose ground or economy services:\nPackage Weight and Dimensions: Heavier and larger packages incur higher shipping fees.\nShipping Distance: Longer distances generally result in higher costs.\nDelivery Speed: Faster delivery options come at a premium.\nCarrier Selection: Different carriers have varying rate structures and discounts.\nProduct Type: Hazardous or fragile items may require special handling, increasing costs.\nShipping Timing: Scheduling shipments during off-peak times or in advance can lead to discounts.\nUnderstanding these factors can help you choose the most cost-effective shipping method for your needs.\nComparative Analysis: Ground vs. Economy Shipping\nWhen comparing ground and economy shipping, consider the following aspects:\nCost Comparison\nEconomy shipping is typically less expensive than ground shipping. However, the exact difference depends on package size, weight, distance, and chosen services. For instance, shipping a large, heavy package over a long distance might be more cost-effective with ground shipping despite its higher base rate.\nDelivery Time\nGround shipping usually offers faster delivery times, ranging from 1 to 5 business days, compared to economy shipping's 3 to 10 business days. If timely delivery is crucial, ground shipping is the preferable option.\nService Offerings\nGround shipping often includes additional services such as signature confirmation and guaranteed delivery times. Economy shipping, while reliable, may lack these premium features.\nEnvironmental Impact\nEconomy shipping can be more environmentally friendly due to optimized routing and combined transportation methods, reducing the overall carbon footprint compared to standard ground shipping.\nHow Delivery Time Influences Your Shipping Choice\nThe urgency of your shipment plays a significant role in selecting the appropriate shipping method:\nTime-Sensitive Deliveries: Ground shipping is ideal for packages that need to arrive quickly.\nFlexible Timelines: Economy shipping is suitable for shipments where delivery time is not critical, allowing for cost savings.\nAdditionally, consider the shipping distance. Local shipments might still benefit from ground shipping's speed, while long-distance packages may require a balance between cost and delivery time.\nStrategies to Reduce Shipping Costs\nImplementing the following strategies can help you save on shipping expenses:\nCompare Rates: Regularly compare shipping rates among different carriers to find the best deals.\nUtilize Discounts: Take advantage of carrier discounts, bulk shipping rates, and promotional offers.\nOptimize Packaging: Use appropriately sized packaging to reduce weight and dimensional fees.\nLeverage Shipping Tools: Use shipping calculators and software to estimate costs and identify savings opportunities.\nConsolidate Shipments: Combine multiple shipments into a single package when possible to minimize costs.\nBest Practices for Preparing Packages\nProper packaging ensures that your shipments arrive safely and can help reduce shipping costs:\nUse Sturdy Boxes: Select boxes that can support the weight and dimensions of your package.\nProtect Contents: Utilize bubble wrap, packing peanuts, or other cushioning materials to prevent damage.\nSecure Packaging: Seal all seams and edges with durable tape, reinforcing corners as needed.\nClear Labeling: Clearly label packages with the recipient\u2019s and sender\u2019s addresses.\nInclude Documentation: Add a packing slip or invoice inside the package for easy reference.\nFuture Trends in Shipping Services\nThe shipping industry is continuously evolving, driven by the growth of e-commerce and advancements in technology:\nIncreased Automation: Automation in logistics and warehousing is improving efficiency and reducing costs.\nSustainable Practices: Carriers are adopting greener practices to minimize environmental impact.\nEnhanced Tracking: Improved tracking technologies offer greater visibility and transparency for shipments.\nInnovative Delivery Methods: Drone deliveries and autonomous vehicles are on the rise, promising faster and more flexible shipping options.\nStaying informed about these trends will help you adapt your shipping strategies to meet future demands and leverage new opportunities.\nConclusion: Making the Right Shipping Choice\nSelecting between ground and economy shipping depends on your specific business needs, including budget, delivery time, and the nature of your shipments. Ground shipping offers reliability and speed, making it suitable for time-sensitive and valuable packages. In contrast, economy shipping provides a cost-effective solution for non-urgent deliveries, helping you save money while still ensuring your packages reach their destination securely.\nBy understanding the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of each option, and by implementing cost-saving strategies, you can optimize your shipping processes to enhance efficiency and customer satisfaction.\nReferences\nUPS Tracking Services\nFedEx Tracking\nUSPS Inside Track Tracking\nDHL Innovation\nUS Shipping Market Size - Statista\nAbout the Author\nAnthony Robinson is the CEO of ShipScience, a pioneering company dedicated to helping e-commerce leaders optimize their shipping decisions, reduce costs, and automate tedious processes.

That's why using real-time shipping rates with UPS can be a game-changer for your business. In this article, we'll provide a comprehensive guide to everything you need to know about setting up and using real-time shipping rates with UPS.\nWhy Using Real-Time Shipping Rates is Important for Your Business\nCustomers today expect transparency and real-time information when it comes to shipping. If they don't know how much shipping will cost until they reach the checkout page, they may abandon their cart or choose a competitor who offers more transparent shipping pricing. According to Shopify, the average cart abandonment rate is around 70%. By using real-time shipping rates, you can provide customers with accurate shipping costs based on their location and the products they're buying. This helps to build trust with your customers, reduce cart abandonment rates, and increase conversions.\nAnother benefit of using real-time shipping rates is that it can help you save money on shipping costs. By accurately calculating shipping costs based on the weight and dimensions of the package, as well as the destination, you can avoid overcharging customers for shipping and reduce the likelihood of having to cover the cost of shipping errors or miscalculations. According to UPS Business Insights, accurate shipping calculations can save businesses up to 15% on shipping costs.\nReal-time shipping rates can also help you streamline your shipping process and improve customer satisfaction. With accurate shipping costs and delivery estimates, you can better manage customer expectations and provide them with a positive shipping experience. Additionally, real-time shipping rates can help you identify areas where you can improve your shipping process, such as by optimizing packaging or negotiating better rates with carriers.\nHow to Set Up Your UPS Account for Real-Time Shipping Rates\nThe first step to using real-time shipping rates with UPS is to set up an account with them. You can do this by visiting the UPS website and following the step-by-step instructions. Once you have an account set up, you'll need to integrate the UPS shipping plugin into your e-commerce platform. Most e-commerce platforms, such as Shopify, WooCommerce, and Magento, have built-in integrations with UPS that make it easy to set up real-time shipping rates. You'll need to enter your UPS account details into the plugin to get started.\nAfter you have integrated the UPS shipping plugin into your e-commerce platform, you can start configuring your shipping settings. You can choose which UPS services you want to offer to your customers, such as ground shipping, 2-day air, or overnight shipping. You can also set up shipping rules based on the weight and dimensions of your products, as well as the destination of the shipment. This will ensure that your customers are getting accurate shipping rates based on their specific order.\nIt's important to note that real-time shipping rates with UPS may not always be the cheapest option for your customers. Depending on the size and weight of the package, it may be more cost-effective to use a different shipping carrier or service. Make sure to compare rates from different carriers to ensure that you are offering the best shipping options to your customers.\nThe Benefits of Real-Time Shipping Rates with UPS\nIn addition to increased transparency and customer trust, there are many other benefits to using real-time shipping rates with UPS. For example, it can save you time and money by automating the shipping process. You won't need to manually calculate shipping costs, weigh packages, or fill out shipping labels. Real-time shipping rates also give you the ability to offer multiple shipping options to customers, such as overnight, 2-day, or ground shipping. This can help to attract more customers with different shipping needs.\nAnother benefit of using real-time shipping rates with UPS is that it can help you to streamline your inventory management. By having accurate and up-to-date shipping information, you can better manage your stock levels and ensure that you have the right products in the right place at the right time. This can help to reduce the risk of stockouts and overstocking, which can both be costly for your business. Additionally, real-time shipping rates can help you to optimize your shipping routes and reduce delivery times, which can improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.\nUnderstanding the Different Shipping Methods Offered by UPS\nUPS offers several different shipping methods to choose from, depending on the speed and cost you're looking for. For example, UPS Ground is a cost-effective option for shipping within the United States, while UPS Next Day Air is a faster but more expensive option. UPS also offers international shipping options, such as UPS Worldwide Express and UPS Worldwide Expedited, for shipping outside of the United States. It's important to understand the different shipping options available to you so that you can choose the best option for your business and your customers.\nAnother important factor to consider when choosing a shipping method is the size and weight of your package. UPS offers different packaging options, such as envelopes, boxes, and tubes, to accommodate a variety of sizes and shapes. Additionally, UPS has weight and size restrictions for each shipping method, so it's important to check these restrictions before selecting a shipping option. By understanding the different packaging options and restrictions, you can ensure that your package is shipped safely and efficiently.\nHow to Calculate Shipping Costs with UPS\nCalculating shipping costs with UPS is based on a few factors, including the destination, package weight, and shipping method. Once you have an account with UPS and have integrated the shipping plugin into your e-commerce platform, the plugin will automatically calculate shipping costs based on these factors. If you're shipping in bulk or have unique shipping needs, you can also get a custom quote from UPS for more accurate pricing. According to the UPS Price Estimator, accurate cost calculations can lead to savings of up to 10% on shipping expenses.\nTips for Reducing Shipping Costs with UPS\nWhile real-time shipping rates can help to provide transparency and accuracy for customers, it's also important to keep shipping costs as low as possible for your business. Here are a few tips for reducing shipping costs with UPS:\nUse the right packaging size: Choose the smallest box or envelope possible to reduce shipping costs based on weight.\nMinimize package weight: Eliminate unnecessary packaging materials and use smaller product sizes when possible.\nNegotiate rates: UPS offers discounts for bulk shipping, so be sure to negotiate rates for larger volumes or frequent shipping.\nUse the right shipping method: Choose the right shipping method that balances cost and speed based on customer needs.\nThe Importance of Accurate Packaging and Weights for Real-Time Shipping Rates\nOne of the most critical factors in calculating accurate shipping costs with UPS is ensuring that you have the correct package weight and dimensions. If the weight or dimensions are incorrect, the shipping cost will be inaccurate, and your customers may be charged more or less than they should. To avoid these issues, be sure to use a proper scale to weigh packages and measure them accurately. Additionally, use high-quality packaging materials that will protect products during shipping, so you don't have to worry about returns or damaged products.\nHow to Track Your Shipments with UPS in Real-Time\nAfter you've shipped a package, you'll want to be able to track it in real-time to ensure it arrives at its destination on time and in good condition. UPS offers a tracking system that allows you to monitor the progress of your shipments from the time they're picked up until they're delivered. You can access this tracking information by logging into your UPS account or using the tracking number provided to you when you shipped the package.

Additionally, UPS may have specific shipping restrictions or requirements based on the products you're shipping. To avoid these issues, be sure to:\nDouble-check all package weights and dimensions\nReview UPS's shipping policies and restrictions before shipping\nEnsure that your e-commerce platform's plugin is correctly configured\nIntegrating Real-Time Shipping Rates with UPS into Your E-commerce Website\nIf you're using an e-commerce website, you'll need to integrate real-time shipping rates with UPS into your site to ensure that customers can see accurate shipping costs during the checkout process.

                "text": "FEATURES\nPARTNERS\nRESOURCES\nFREIGHT SOLUTIONS\nABOUT\nCONTACT\n816.781.5100\nHow Cartonization Works to Reduce Shipping Costs and Waste\nby Austen Gooch | Mar 22, 2023 | Shipping Automation + Optimization\nThe cost savings and efficiencies high-volume shippers can gain from packing items in exactly the right size box can be significant.\nWe\u2019ve all been there \u2014 you order a few small things online that arrive in a huge box. Why has the shipper packed them in a box that\u2019s way too big? How do shippers get it so wrong? The question, though, is: How can they get it right? Few people understand the complex world of high-volume parcel fulfillment and the tools, such as advanced cartonization, that can help optimize this process.\nAdvanced cartonization is a process that uses sophisticated algorithms and software to evaluate the size, shape, and weight of every item in an order to determine the most efficient packaging options. In addition to determining optimal box size and the number of items in each box, it also suggests an arrangement of the items within the carton to maximize space utilization, minimize shipping costs, and minimize the risk of damage to the items in transit.\nTypically 3-D modeling creates a virtual representation of the items to be packed in the available cartons. Algorithms then determine the optimal packing arrangement based on the items\u2019 size, shape, weight, fragility, hazmat restrictions, and packing material requirements. The system can then instruct the shipper \u2014 the person loading the actual box \u2014 what size box to use for which items and how to properly load those items into the box. For example, it could instruct a worker to lay Item A flat, put Item B on its side, and wrap Item C for protection.\nHow does cartonization work in my shipping operations?\nYou can integrate cartonization software into multiple systems \u2013 typically, it\u2019s a shipper\u2019s Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platform, a Warehouse Management System (WMS), an order management system (OMS), or an online shopping cart platform. When a customer places an order, cartonization captures the unique IDs of each SKU, calculates the dimensions of each, and determines the most efficient way to pack them into the smallest box possible.\nThe rating information is then pushed back to the OMS or shopping cart to assign shipping costs, and the box and packing logic instructions are pushed to the warehouse for the shipper to follow. The box is packed according to the rules, the shipping label is automatically generated, and the package is on its way with the right carrier.\nAn effective cartonization engine within a parcel shipping platform can make these package decisions in fractions of a second, while also factoring in the shipper\u2019s operational constraints, parcel costs within the shipper\u2019s carrier network, as well as various dimensional pricing factors offered by different carriers. These tools allow high-volume shippers to take the guesswork out of package sizing, resulting in potential cost savings into the millions, an improved carbon footprint, and a significant reduction in cardboard and other packing materials usage.  \nHow does cartonization work in practice?\nLet\u2019s look at an example of cartonization at work.\nConsider a shipper that regularly ships a certain group of items in a 12x12x8 inch box, but cartonization logic instructs the shipper to use a 12x12x6 box utilizing better packing logic. That seemingly little change \u2013 only 2 inches \u2013 can reduce dimensional weight for this same shipment down by 25% (from 8 lbs. to 6 lbs.), thereby reducing shipping costs by as much as 10%, or approximately $2 in this particular example. For a shipper that averages 4k+ of these shipments per day, that could add up to more than $2 million in annual savings.\nMoreover, removing that 2-inch ring at the top of the box in this example (6\u201d versus 8\u201d tall), reduces cardboard usage by 0.667 square feet per box (another ~10% reduction). If you repeat this one million times a year, the cardboard usage would be 667,000 sq ft, which is roughly 33 tons of cardboard, taking approximately 550 trees to produce. This small, isolated incremental change could therefore save a little over an acre of forest every year.   \nRight-sizing boxes and packaging material can lead to significant cost savings over time, which is especially important for businesses that ship large volumes of goods or have high shipping costs. Working with the right partner to employ a feature-rich shipping software can be instrumental in applying efficiency-gaining cartonization logic at scale.\nRead more:\n7 Reasons Why a Multi-Carrier Shipping Solution (Almost Always) Beats A Single-Carrier Strategy\nShipping Software Features\nCarrier Management\nOperational Support\nShipping Analytics + Data Visibility\nShipping Automation + Optimization\nTestimonial\nLinkedIn\nSearch\nRecent Posts\nPhone\n(816) 781-5100\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright Shipstore\nREQUEST A DEMO\n      HOW MANY PARCELS DO YOU SHIP PER DAY?\nLESS THAN 100\n101 TO 500\n501 TO 1,000\n1,001 TO 10,000\n10,001 TO 100,000\nMORE THAN 100,000\n      SUBMIT"
