By tapping centralized data and predictive reports, you can proactively and systematically reduce that necessary overhead.\nFleet GPS tracking gives you the ability to see what really happened and can help you save time and money, while also protecting your drivers, maximizing efficiency, and gaining peace of mind. Regular GPS data by itself can only tell you so much, but when you incorporate live driver footage into your operations via a fleet dash cam, you can have total control of your fleet like never before.\nA fleet dash cam system from FleetOptix can verify that your drivers are following safety protocols so you can keep your vehicles on the road and your operations running smoothly. Our  fleet GPS tracking provides standard features along with video for driver-side and/or road-facing cameras.\nImprove Fleet Safety\nHaving real-time data at your fingertips will help you spot potential problems — accident-prone drivers, lease mileage issues, upcoming repairs — before they happen. The system transmits videos simultaneously from all cameras within seconds of an incident, providing instant visibility and the ability to quickly resolve liability. With a comprehensive set of data, you can also track money-saving and expense-reducing trends.\nCloud-connected GPS tracking fleet dash cameras from FleetOptix deliver continual high-quality video clips and night vision via a searchable online dashboard. In addition, the front and rear-facing cameras provide a 360-degree view. You can also run reports based on date/time for a detailed picture of the distance and time the vehicles have traveled.\nThe right fleet dash cam system will help you protect and track your vehicles in real time while also allowing you to create geo-fences and get real-time notifications on any device. You can also automatically upload event videos as-they-happen and create reports to view and print at-a-glance totals for distance driven, idle time, speeding incidents, and more.\nReal-Time Tracking\nThe FleetOptix fleet GPS tracking system gives you an intuitive way to track your fleet in real time and notify you of events — speeding, impact accidents, harsh acceleration, sudden braking. You will receive a notification and the ability to look at a number of still images taken at the time of the event. You will also get the opportunity to view a video file from the fleet dash cam.\nWith fleet GPS tracking, you can record the road and the interior of the cab, which can lead to a decrease in risky driving. Fleet dash cameras can also spot seat belt violations, distracted driving, littering, and other inappropriate driver behaviors.\nArchived video can be used to develop driver coaching and customize instruction according to the individual’s needs. Additionally, you can use the data to identify cost outliers or investigate damage or other quotas.\nBy using tools such as geofences — powered by Google and our interactive maps as well as our fleet telematics solution — you can monitor your fleet’s whereabouts. You can also maintain control of locations you’ve set as off-limits — bars, adult entertainment facilities or even the driver’s home. Fleet management from FleetOptix gives you 24/7 coverage that powers and protects your business.\n81% of Truckers Are Found Liable in Accidents!Protect your drivers and your fleet against accident claims with our GPS camerasGet a free quoteSee What Your Drivers See With A Fleet Dash Cam with GPS tracking\nWhen you own or manage a fleet of trucks or vehicles, you need to keep track of a lot of information — from who is where and in which truck to what the mileage is between points. There are times of arrival to monitor, data to analyze, regulations to stay on top of, and maintenance to schedule. And that’s just for starters.\nOne way busy fleet owners and managers stay on top of their myriad responsibilities is to leverage technology-powered tools like a dash cam with GPS tracking system. Fleet dash cameras put you in the driver’s seat so you can see what your drivers see in real-time and/or video playback. A fleet camera system removes the guesswork by giving you fast, laser-accurate information that you can analyze to glean insightful data. Fleet dash camera data can help improve safety and can also exonerate your driver if an accident was not his or her fault. The right GPS tracking camera system gives you the ability to mediate tough situations with fast accuracy.\nProtect Your Drivers Against Accident Claims!Our cameras have reduced disputed claims from 40% to 2% for fleet ownersGet a free quoteFleet Dash Camera systems from FleetOptix capture the entire scene\nFleet dash cameras from FleetOptix capture the entire scene, inside and out. With road-facing, driver-side, rear and side cameras, you get full visibility of what your driver is dealing with. You get a full front-facing view of the road as well as an inside view of the cab and driver. A secondary camera can also be installed anywhere in the truck to give you an extended view of the side and rear, which can be especially helpful in the event of an accident. Learn more about our full Truck Dash Cam lineup and how it can help you manage your Fleet more effectively. Further, with fleet GPS tracking, you will always know a driver’s live location and have access to real-time images and video.\nAll of the tamper-free videos are instantly uploaded and stored in the cloud for comprehensive use in insurance claims, court cases, driver coaching, and more.

Said:\nNo hassle and Reduced Cost\nGoShare is my now go-to for transporting materials. We manufacture building materials that require testing at 3rd party test facilities.  Before we would fly someone into the town and rent a truck.  Now with GoShare we simply arrange a day before and the next morning materials are delivered with no hassle and reduced cost on our end. Thank you GoShare!!!\nCarmen A. Said:\nLove GoShare\nLove GoShare! I purchased furniture at Homegoods.  I was in direct communication with a GoShare rep as it was July 2 a holiday weekend. I driver accepted for next day when Homegoods opened.  I spoke to the driver and you get updates to your cellphone.  I will continue to use GoShare for all me delivery needs. The cost of transport was very reasonable too!\nRebekah B. Said:\nGreat, No Hassle Service\nThis is a great service. We booked online and the request was accepted within minutes. A few hours later our driver picked up our couch at Home Sense with no issues and delivered on time at our home shortly after.  Such a great no hassle service and our delivery guy was great!\nCrystal B. Said:\nSuper Easy, Convenient and Fast\nSuper easy. Convenient and fast. I was needing a pickup and delivery of a package so of course I went to Google and found GoShare. Being reluctant,  I did it, and the outcome was great. If you are in need of a quick, super easy and convenient delivery company GoShare is your company.  I'm from Atlanta, GA I did try reaching out to other companies before this with no response.  GoShare allowed me to do everything straight from the app, including track my package.  Thank You GoShare.\nDimitar B. Said:\nPrompt, Professional, Friendly\nGoShare was recommended in store by Bob's Discount Furniture. Signing up through the Apple iPhone App Store was easy. The process is intuitive and as simple as possible. I requested a service before we left the store - 10 minutes from start to finish. We were linked to a transport company within 10 minutes before we managed to leave the plaza. The service we received was prompt, professional, friendly, accurate and with great care. Will recommend to any friend who needs fast, reliable transport avoiding the overpriced premiums of others. Will definitely use again.\nFrancesca P. Said:\nGoShare is incredible\nGoShare is incredible.  I have used them three times now and every time they are getting me out of a bind in such an efficient and cost effective way!  This third time I used bigger truck - with one day's notice! - that was clean and big and the driver and helper were fantastic.  And it was a long distance delivery!  I am so tired of the pricing and rigidity of the traditional moving industry.  I am so grateful for GoShare.\nBrittany L. Said:\nHelpful and Professional\nGreat service! Downloaded the app and my furniture was picked up and delivered in about an hour! Musa, our driver, was helpful and professional. It's kinda like the Uber for furniture (or other heavy duty items) delivery! Highly recommend.\nAndy S. Said:\nOn Demand Courier and Freight Services\nI had been looking for a service that could provide on demand courier and freight services for my business. I came across GoShare through a Google search and could not be happier with the service thus far. I've done about a dozen orders in the past few weeks and each time the driver has been on time or early, friendly, and very helpful.\nWill J. Said:\nGreat App\nGoShare is the Uber of when you need a \"truck or a van and a guy\". Great App. Fast Response. and reasonably priced. This will become more & more popular when the word gets out. I had a guy come out with a beautiful new cargo van he bought just to be a GoShare Driver.  Great attitude and excellent service.\nBeth V. Said:\nGreat Service!\nI have found pieces of furniture at Home Goods in the past but neglected to purchased due to not having the right truck to transport- yesterday I found 2 gorgeous pieces to use in our rental home at the beach & was so happy to see the advertisement right there on top of the tv cabinet I wanted- I signed up while waiting in line & just had both pieces delivery by Henry! Very professional & punctual! Love this service & will ask for Henry in the future!\nCurran D. Said:\nAmazing Service, Fair Prices\nLoved my first experience with this company and app. The driver was able to pick up the furniture on his own without me having to meet at the store I bought the furniture from, which was convenient with my busy schedule. The driver took very good care of the furniture, using blankets and tie downs. The driver also helped move it into my house, and wow was it heavy. The driver went above and beyond, I couldn't be more pleased with this app. Thanks for running a great service.\nM. Panday Said:\nProfessional and Punctual\nHad a wonderful experience using GoShare to get a power recliner sofa with 6 big boxes delivered from local Costco store to my apartment. The individuals were very professional and punctual. The Goshare platform was simple and straight forward and I got response within minutes of submitting move request. I would recommend anyone looking to do moves or pickup to use their services. In fact while at Costco many people enquires about how and what I am using to move. The plus was that the platform allows you to add a helper to your request.

Our software delivers a fully digital solution connecting all stakeholders within the inbound gate-to-gate process.\nHow it Works\nFreightSmith is revolutionizing how businesses manage their warehouse receiving process by providing a comprehensive suite of digital freight management services that are easy to use yet powerful enough for even the most complex operations. From its remote pre-check capability of up to 24hrs in advance of delivery, and 24/7/365 customer support, to its real-time updates at the receiver level for all deliveries along with instant access to all digital unloading receipts including a comprehensive load management tool supporting door assignment and PO/load resolution. FreightSmith has everything warehouse managers need to remain competitive in today’s ever-evolving supply chain landscape. With its innovative technology solutions directly linked to other operating systems via API FreightSmith is setting a new standard for digital freight management services.\nFreightSmith IMS – Inbound Management System\nThe FreightSmith IMS warehouse portal is the key to any receiving manager’s success in expediting inbound operational flow. The IMS solution allows staff to communicate directly with drivers as they provide gate passes for trucks to enter their facility as well as assign doors and notify drivers immediately when a door is available and ready.\nThe IMS tool time stamps and tracks every step of the way for each load, allowing receiving managers to monitor inbound progress, track staged vehicles, and proactively reduce detention exposure at their entire facility.\nFreightSmith completes the chain and provides the data linkage that can be used to optimize any warehouse receiving process eliminating the black hole in the supply chain path.\nLearn More\nFreightSmith – Mobile App\nThe mobile app is available for free in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.\nOnce the driver downloads the application on their smartphone, they will be able to check-in remotely for their scheduled appointment as well as gain access to full visibility of the gate-to-gate process for their delivery. The FreightSmith check-in process can be completed away from the facility at a convenient time and location to optimize the driver’s HOS. Most valuable to drivers and carriers is that they can process unloading payments from within the app with digital receipts supplied that can be accessed later as needed. The digital documentation can easily be shared with shippers and carriers ensuring a complete record of the delivery in a timely manner.\nAll of this can be done from the safety and comfort of the cab of their truck.\nLearn More\nFreightSmith SchedulePro\nFreightSmith SchedulePro is the ultimate solution for streamlining and simplifying warehouse appointment scheduling – the dynamic, yet cost-effective tool designed by experts from inbound warehouse operations.

(I usually find shoving a pencil through my ear more gratifying)! I really do like the service that we have been getting from your company.  You can thank Jim Bullard, the owner of Interim Healthcare in Lubbock for suggesting I try your service!Brad SwensonThank you! Have used LSO for many years. Not 1 complaint. We appreciate ya’ll.Christine KDee was PERFECTION!!! Fast, qualified, prepared, friendly, knowledgeable and very friendly! A breath of fresh air! Kudos to you and her!Dave GarciaA Texas-based company with Texas employees, providing stellar Texas-friendly service on a daily basis. I use LSO three times a week and usually, everything gets to its destination on time or early, but the important part is that, if something goes wrong, I can reach a live person almost instantly and they always stay with my problem until it’s solved. Every time. With a smile. Can’t beat that with a stick.Diana DowI love having LSO deliver my packages. I can actually communicate with them by phone. Jessica just did a tremendous job in tracking my package and making sure it was delivered within my specified time frame. LSO is head over heels better than the other two.Don CookI don’t even have to enter a contest to validate how great LSO is! We at the San Antonio Salvation Army utilize Lone Star & have for years. I used to work at our Divisional HQ in Dallas & always knew when we got a package from SA because it was always in an LS envelope. After transferring here, I quickly understood why. I use the automated system for packaging slips & pick-up. Customer service has always efficiently assisted me with any problems.Geneva MurphyWe have been Lone Star customers for many years. They meet our demanding expectations.Haydeline SolisWe highly recommend LSO for all business and home deliveries.Howard BielGreat company. I received notification that I was to receive delivery but I was going on vacation that same day. I called to let LSO know and they arranged to get my delivery to me early. The woman I spoke to on the phone and the driver who delivered my parcel were both so polite and helpful. I would not hesitate to recommend this company!!Jackie CThe extra level of service by a regional carrier such as LSO makes the difference in gaining and maintaining clients.John TOur firm, McCall, Parkhurst & Horton, has been an LSO customer for 30 years, and we have always appreciated your service and staff, but tonight your employees went way beyond your great company and service, and we thank you. Please let the San Antonio courier Manager, the Customer Service Representative, and the courier know how much we appreciate getting our package picked up after it was accidentally deposited in the LSO bin shortly after the 6:00 pm deadline. We called customer service to see if the courier could come back, and they did!! Your dutiful customer service rep, Andrea (I think that is her name) and your night Manager and the pickup person, should all be acknowledged as exemplary team members and recognized by LSO. Again, thank you, and we are loyal customers and so appreciate your loyalty to us to get the job done of delivering our package to Austin Monday morning. Again, so grateful, and thank you for having employees that care.Kathy S. cooperOur trust in them has been unblemished.keith patricioWe have exceptional response times with LSO. The nature of our business, plus our steady business growth, requires a number of capabilities in the regional shipping partner we choose – reliability, responsiveness, flexibility and price – to name a few.Maryann StoddardWe take shipping seriously.

Custom packaging, on the other hand, is designed specifically for a brand, allowing for unique sizes, designs, and branding elements like logos.\nHow long does it take to produce and deliver custom packaging orders?\nOur production and delivery timeline is optimized for efficiency. The exact timeframe depends on factors like order size, customization complexity, and shipping destination. We strive to balance swift delivery with maintaining the highest quality standards in your custom packaging.\nHow do I get my tracking info?\nLog onto Arka account\nIs there a minimum order quantity for custom packaging?\nWe understand that businesses have varying needs, so we offer low minimum order quantities to make our services accessible to both small and large businesses. This flexibility helps you manage inventory and costs effectively.\nCan I get a prototype or sample of my custom packaging before placing a large order?\nYes, we provide prototypes and samples so you can assess the quality and fit of your custom packaging. This step ensures that you are completely satisfied with the design and material before committing to a larger order and designing you ideal custom boxes.\nDo you offer any after-sales support or customer service for custom packaging orders?\nCustomer satisfaction is a top priority for us.

They originally came in to help with safety and ergonomics and ended up helping improve our building security and receiving process. They were very patient with us and listen to our needs. The software engineers not only took our information and created something great but they also added features we didn’t think possible. They have really gone above and beyond what we originally thought possible.\nLeo Chen\nDirector of IT at Bloomsung\nArvist helped us design and implement a system to monitor the inbound traffic to our yard using our existing security cameras. We are able to monitor 24/7 now instead of relying on security guards to collect all the information we need. The Arvist team is very constructive and responsive.

These increases, spurred by multichannel retail and B2B e-commerce, are unlikely to reduce.Companies are faced with increased parcel delivery costs, driven by fuel and labor cost inflation, and shippers often lack the tools to optimize their transportation spend effectively.Most providers of ERP, transportation management systems (TMS), order management systems (OMS) and warehouse management systems (WMS) do not specialize in parcel capability. Rather, they partner with a noncompeting multicarrier parcel management solution (MCPMS) to support their customers.

The company has strong growth, good financial sustainability and thus contributes to leading the focus on sustainability in logistics.  For Centiro, employees are the company's most important resource and great emphasis is placed on creating a culture where everyone feels involved in the company's success. The strong culture means that there is courage to challenge traditional norms and established approaches to building value-creating services and processes.Through innovative solutions and dedicated customer teams, Centiro has developed its processes and working methods in a unique way and created a customer-oriented business development that is world-class. Centiro is a very good role model and a worthy recipient of the Swedish Quality Award. Gustaf Stawåsen, CISO at Centiro says, “I believe our unique way of working with our culture, our colleagues at heart, and a partner-driven customer focus – challenge traditional structures and non-value metrics. The process with SIQ has been comprehensive in many steps, with an amazing evaluation team and great questions and discussions. A rare, rewarding and enlightening experience”.  The Swedish Quality Award highlights role models and is given to organizations that have demonstrated significant results from their successful quality work. The operations are illuminated from a holistic perspective where strengths and opportunities for improvement are identified in detail based on the SIQ Management model, which is a basis for how organizations achieve success with their operations. SIQ – the Swedish Institute for Quality is the national center for business excellence in Sweden. They are a non-profit organization founded in 1990 with the support of the Swedish Government as well as their members association, private companies, institutions, and the public sector. Niklas Hedin, Centiro CEO says, “Challenging status quo and norms, even in quality management, to reach better outcomes for our customer, with a strong people- and culture focus has been our DNA from day one. The tireless efforts of our amazing colleagues, and a crisp vision of how we want to push the possible has now brought us to the top.

To understand, make sense. The industry nomenclature around supply chain software systems is no different. Categories and distinctions were created in a time when the world was different. And the nomenclature around parcel management, first- and or final mile has yet to catch up.\nAnd by the way, you may or may not agree, this is my opinion. But it’s well-founded. A couple of things are making sure the maps have to be updated, and perhaps new categories invented. Digitization, Pandemic, well, I think I’ll stop right there.\nSure, we have a cloud offering in the space of Parcel Management. It does what it says on the tin really well. It’s just that it is used to do so much more, or perhaps even for other reasons than to just ship a box, and few of our customers – many of which who are changing the game out there as you read this – use that nomenclature. Piling bricks or building a cathedral? I know the winners out there think different.\nIntelligent balancing of network capacity across partners. Real time, consumer-facing optimization that takes network capacity, carrier service portfolio, economy and sustainable aspects into consideration while maintaining that the important part – the promise for a given delivery date – is kept. Double-digit percentage savings while increasing capacity, reach and on-time performance. Rapid on-boarding of network partners and thousands of stores to create a virtual, digitally connected network that executes far and beyond your own assets, increasing inventory availability while shortening distance to market, resulting in strategic supply-chain capabilities on par with the biggest and best in the market. Parcel Management? Perhaps. I suggest it’s more than that.\nAnd yes, at the core lies strong functional capabilities that seem trivial at first glance. Of course, there are additions and modules you can extend our Parcel Management offering with like visibility, financial control etc. - still functional, useful and value-creating. Couple that with a clever strategy and assemble the parts and systems in a different way than normal. Boom - that’s when magic happens, and Parcel Management as a tool and even category can move from a System of Record and Execution to become a System of Innovation – a strong catalyst that is core to the empowerment of disruptive strategy, where timelines from ideation to business impact and excellence, shrink. Where differentiation truly happens. I have a lot of good observations, which involves anything from seemingly trivial items like clothes and shoes and transformation of retail to seriously important items like enabling and controlling the distribution of vaccines to fight the corona virus.\nSo those are my two cents. There is of course more to talk about. There are lots of things to do, to change and to make better, smarter and faster. Perhaps you are in the middle of these challenges and are wondering how to get a grip and structured thought on what to do. Well, don’t be a stranger. This is in fact our daytime job, to help and to modernize supply chains.\nIn the meantime, I present you with a market guide for Multi Carrier Parcel Management Systems. It’s a good read, and our company is in it. Modules, geographic coverage and all. But I wouldn’t stop there. I encourage you to reach out, as there is so much more to talk about. We’re on a mission. Are you?\n{{cta('38967cde-b2f3-48a8-8751-0aaf4db673d5','justifycenter')}}17FebRead more   ReportsCentiro recognized as Representative Vendor in Gartner Market GuideCentiro recognized as representative vendor in Gartner 2021 Market Guide for Multicarrier Parcel Management SolutionsWhat is in the Report\"Parcel delivery levels and returns are accelerating.

And this is a field in which Centiro has considerable experience, both with its software and wider expertise within the company.\"At a time when sustainability, circular models and the issue of how to create a better world are all in the spotlight, entering into a partnership with Humanium Metal feels perfectly natural. The idea of getting rid of illegal weapons and at the same time creating a multitude of new benefits is absolutely right.

Our proprietary smart containers and cloud-based platform does away with rigid silos and competing priorities across the middle mile, and instead brings together all the players—from shippers and carriers, to 3PLs and end-consumers. In this game,EVERYONE CAN WIN.Thought PiecesARTICLEWhy Switching to CloudSort Containers Makes Financial Sense for Your BusinessIn today's fast-paced and competitive logistics business environment, finding ways to optimize costs while maintaining efficiency is essential for success. CloudSort offers a game-changing solution that not only streamlines logistics operations but also delivers substantial cost savings compared to traditional shipping options. Read MoreARTICLEThe Multiple Advantages of Reusable Containers in TransportationAdoption of reusable containers is trending higher within the transportation industry. While the primary incentive for adopting reusable transport packaging tends to be cost savings related to reduced consumables spend, other factors have also contributed to the increased adoption of reusable containers. Read MoreARTICLEUnlocking the Full Potential of Zone SkippingToday's supply chains are increasingly complex, leading to a maze of touchpoints that can introduce inefficiencies and raise costs. For every additional touch—each time a package is handled, sorted, or stored—the risks of delays, damage, and ballooning costs escalate. This fragmentation also degrades the overall customer experience. How can businesses minimize these issues?Read MoreInsightsPurpose-Built Containers Can Enhance the Effectiveness of Your Cross-Dock StrategyCross-docking can streamline operations, reduce handling time, and accelerate delivery to meet rising customer expectations. In the context of transporting goods such as packages or inventory, cross-docking refers to when these goods are transferred from one load to another without individual items being sorted. CloudSort containers help organizations increase cross-dock opportunities - transforming how goods are handled, stored, and distributed.Read MorePressCloudSort Containers honored in Fast Company Innovation By Design Awards 2024!CloudSort was honored in Fast Company's Innovation by Design Awards for 2024 in the Best Circular Design category and Best Design in North America category.

In a world of close box software solutions, this was so refreshing.\nShipWise is the third shipping software we've used in production environment over the last 7 years, and is by the far the best I've encountered. As a 3PL, we ship thousands of packages per day, with the need to account for a multitude of variables in our order data at any given time. DSX has inherently been able to handle these situations in most cases, and the ShipWise team has generally been able to accommodate even our edge cases.

Because of their auto rate shop feature, we are able to ship over 80% of our orders without even touching anything on the computer. You place the item and package on the scale, scan the packing slip barcode, and within 5 seconds the label is printed! BOOM.Richard A.\n, Dollar Hobbyz\nDollar Hobbyz\nElevate Fulfillment used multiple solutions before implementing ShipWise.

PIPE17\nHighly flexible and great implementation support team\nPipe17 is serving as the central hub for our retail order data pipelines between our front end carts, Amazon, NetSuite and our 3PL WMS. It’s capable of handling a wide variety of data sources and connections. Implementation support team is amazing.\nJeremy H. | G2 review\nEase, navigational friendliness & support\nIt is a solution that works great in the short term and the long term. Pipe17 helps me manage orders and connections. Their team understands my vision and has provided excellent support and assistance.\nRob C. | G2 review\nAs a CTO, Pipe17’s transparency made me feel very comfortable.\nPipe17 allows us to focus on where we think we can bring the best value to the consumers. Everything is auditable. Everything is explainable. Every single action the system takes is documented and explained and can be influenced.\nRoi Zahut | CTO| Aterian\nGame changing\nWe needed a capable middle layer between our storefronts and fulfillment providers and we wanted to automate order routing to minimize time spent dealing with individual orders. We were pleasantly surprised by the granularity of order and inventory status, and the level of automation we could achieve with Pipe17.\nRichard W. | G2 review\nGreat product that creates optionality for your business\nPipe17 has a wide range of features that help businesses take back control of their operations from their vendors. For example, the order routing engine gives us optionality that our competitors likely do not have and we would not have just by going through our 3PLs.\nJake W. | G2 review\nPipe17 has been a game changer for our company\nIt was a straightforward process to integrate our ecommerce channels with Pipe17. The Pipe17 staff are helpful and very knowledgeable. All of my questions were answered in full detail. Their main priority is to maximize your companys success. Highly recommended!\nMerv G. | G2 review\nPipe17 has been transformational for us\nThe onboarding process with Pipe17 was very smooth – within one call we were almost entirely operational. I was able to set up bundles without any support in a couple of hours. Now we are fully flowing and rarely have to intervene with any orders. I only have amazing things to say about Pipe17, one of our best partners.\nVerified Customer | G2 review\nPipe17 team is f***** awesome!\nTheir customer support is unparalleled. They respond so quickly its almost like texting. Plus they help you solve complex solutions almost as good as having an operations manager at your fingertips. I went through multiple order management systems before finding Pipe17 and they are the only ones who can pull it off.\nVerified Customer | G2 review\nGreat tool and great team\nThe software is easy to use for non-technical people, making it possible for us to monitor the status of our orders at a glance. Pipe17 has been able to create new connections, specifically for our needs (i.e. to a new 3PL) efficiently and timely.

Then You Need More Than Simple Label Printing.\nGone are the days of relying on a single parcel carrier to handle all your deliveries. Higher shipping costs, omnichannel fulfillment, and customers demand for faster, flexible, and free delivery options are making shippers diversify their carrier service offering. But deciding how, when, and where to use those carrier services has become increasingly complex.Finally, there is a way to automate intelligent decision-making throughout your fulfillment processes: Sendflex Parcel TMS.\nLEARN MORE ABOUT SENDFLEX SOLUTIONS\nCOMPLEXITY SIMPLIFIED\nSendflex Parcel TMS Adds a Data-driven Layer of Intelligence to Your Shipping Processes\nSure, legacy shipping systems do a good job weighing, rating and label printing. But with costs and complexity increasing that isn’t enough anymore. Sendflex’s Parcel TMS platform enables you to diversify your carrier network and automate cost-effective decision-making in eCommerce storefronts, order allocation, fulfillment, and, of course, shipping and returns.Best of all, Sendflex’s no-code wizards enable managers to configure and apply instructions to orders to reduce cost and waste, while optimizing capacity and customer delivery experiences. Use Sendflex instructions to run “what if” simulations against historical shipping data. And then easily re-configure instructions to adapt your operations to changing business conditions. No more costly programming and long project timelines.\nLEARN MORE ABOUT THE SENDFLEX PLATFORM\nCONTROL COSTS, CAPACITY, CARBON, AND CUSTOMERS DELIVERY EXPERIENCES\nHow Sendflex Works for You\nDiversified Carrier Network\nWith eCommerce still in its early growth stage (only 19% of retail), parcel volumes are expected to double in the next two years. That means you need a more resilient carrier network to reduce the risk of delivery disruptions. Our powerful optimization engine makes it easy to manage our extensive network of final mile carriers.\nSuperfast Carrier Rating\nWhen you are quoting delivery costs in shopping carts, optimizing plans, or running simulation models, you don’t have time to “ping” carrier rating APIs. They are too slow and unreliable, and carriers are starting to levy surcharges for overuse. Sendflex Parcel TMS features an onboard rating engine that will accurately calculate over 20,000 rates per second.\nOptimized Carrier Selection\nSendflex enables you to configure instructions to simplify complex carrier service selection processes based not only on carrier rates, but also on transit time, shipment attributes (SKU size, fragility, hazmat, order value, etc.), carrier performance (on-time delivery, damage, etc.), DIM factors, customer preferences, and more.\nCarrier Contract Compliance\nThe gap between expected shipping costs and actual invoice costs is widening. That’s because rating is becoming increasingly dynamic and complex with incentive tiers, surcharges, and daily pickup limits. Sendflex monitors shipping activity in real time and automatically controls routing to alternative carrier services based on your primary carrier commitments.\nOptimize Cartonization\nUnexpected dimensional weight adjustments on carrier invoices are eating into shippers’ margins. Sendflex automates transportation cost-effective packing by applying cartonization algorithms and rules to reduce dimensional fees, waste, corrugated costs, and ensure a better customer sustainability experience.\n“What if” Simulations\nIT professionals have “sandboxes” to test new programs and technology. Sendflex Simulator enables logistics managers to test the cost and service impact of their decisions against historical data. Ex: “What if I had used a regional carrier last November?”, “What if I had fulfilled these orders from a different location?”, “What if I had used different sized cartons?”.\nPOWERFUL RESULTS\nSendflex Makes Everyone a Winner\nLogistics\nAutomate data-driven decisions to expand capacity, control shipping costs, and make and keep your delivery promises using a more diverse carrier network.\nIT\nReduce cost of ownership and time to benefit with secure, cloud-native deployments. No-code configurations and connectors eliminate long IT project timelines and costs.\nFinance\nNo upfront license fees and minimal pro service costs. Only pay for what your organization needs to use with no hidden costs.\nMarketing & Sales\nTake the guesswork out of freight quoting. Instantly calculate rating and time in transit for more carrier options in shopping carts. Make and keep your customer delivery promises.\nCarriers\nUse Sendflex Simulator to prove your service’s cost savings and delivery improvements compared with your customer’s existing carrier historical performance.\nShipping System Vendors\nEnhance your offering by minimizing complex, inflexible scripting, and long IT project timelines. Sendflex shifts control of business rules from IT to logistics managers.\nLEARN\nDownloadThe Case forParcel TMS Simulators\nEBOOK\nHow Intelligent Packing and Parcel Optimization Rules Reduce Margin Erosion, Carbon Emissions, and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nDiscover how Sendflex and Paccurate's combined technologies optimize every stage of the order-to-delivery process, significantly improving margins and sustainability.

Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) and Voice Picking\nReal-time Distribution Software (RDS) Order Release and Pick by Voice, combined with our Gen 3 advanced AMRs, support both large capacity batch cart picking and mixed case pick-to-pallet applications. The RDS application module, Batchbot™, unites people and robots to enable faster picking by reducing walk time by 50% and increasing operator pick rates by 50-100%. Numina's latest generation 3,300 lbs. capacity AMRs can pick up to 30 orders per mission, boosting productivity to the industry's highest hourly AMR pick rates.\nLearn about high performance AMR order picking\n2. Robotic GTP\nRobotic GTP optimizes product storage, retrieval, and order picking. Voice and pick-to-light order consolidation walls at the GTP workstations batch pick 32 orders at a time, increasing picks per tote visit and achieving over 300 line picks per hour for higher productivity. Our conveyor-based pack automation technologies combine pick and pack to carton processes with in-line scan-weight vision content audit, automatic and semi-automatic documentation print & insert, taper-sealers, scan-label-auto-manifest, SLAM, and shipping sortation for end-to-end GTP pick, pack, and ship order fulfillment automation.\nLearn more about Goods to Person\n3. Voice Directed Batch Cart Picking\nPick by Voice using mobile wearable computers, hands-free camera-based scanners, and wireless headsets improves pick rates by 20-30% over RF terminal picking technology. Combining voice picking with optimized order release, cartonization, and batch cart order assignment logic reduces walk time, pick time, and enhances pack validation for a leaner, faster, and highly accurate single-step order picking process.\nLearn more about Voice Directed Batch Cart Picking\n4. Voice Directed High Speed Module\nOptimized multi-level storage and picking solutions provide high-capacity A, B, and C mover product storage in the same module, with 225+ lines/hr. pick rates using RDS Voice Picking for case picking and pick direct-to-shipping carton applications.\nLearn More about Pick Modules\n5. Pick to Light\nRDS pick-to-light (PTL) displays include push-button confirmation for each action, directing the fastest pick rates in dense storage, high-moving SKU pick zones. PTL is also well-suited for sort-by-light and order consolidation put walls used in Goods to Person picking and warehouse order picking when consolidating picks from multiple zones.\nLearn More about Pick to Light\n6. Auto Scan, Weigh, Vision Audit and Labeling\nAutomatically scan, label, apply and manifest (S.L.A.M). This technology scans, weighs, dims, and captures images of cases and carton contents for order validation and improved customer service. This data can also be combined with print and apply labeling to automate the application of retail compliance, carrier shipping labels, and manifesting.\nLearn More about Scan Weigh Vision Audit & Labeling\n7. Print and Apply Labeling and Manifesting\nAutomatically manifest, print, and apply shipping labels without any manual touches. Automatically print and apply shipping labels, parcel carrier and LTL order identifying labels, packing slips or a full 8.5” x 11” packing sheet.\nLearn More about Pack and Ship Automation\n8. PFI Document Print and Insertion\nAutomatically insert packing slips, product specific instructions, marketing materials, or compliance documentation at a rate of 12 cartons per hour.\nLearn More about PFI\n9. Pack Work Station\nRules-based solution for void insertion, packing sheet insertion, and automatic taping of shipping cartons. It automates these tasks, cutting labor costs, boosting accuracy, and enhancing productivity. With a single operator, it can process 6 cartons per minute.\nLearn More about Pakt\n10.

If it wasn't for them, we would have made expensive mistakes and just been Googling random things to figure out how to best capitalize on high-traffic ecommerce events.\"Brea FullertonFounder & CEO\"We wouldn’t be where we are today without the awesome space and business resources Saltbox provides (shout out to the amazing Denver team), and we look forward to being with Saltbox for years to come!\"Charlie GenryHead of Operations“We’ve had problems in the past with carriers losing packages or customers saying an order wasn’t delivered when it was. It negatively affects my small business because I have to ship out another order without reimbursement for the original shipping costs. When shipping with Pandion via Parsel, you can see exactly where your package is in the shipping process and receive confirmation of its exact delivery time and location. It’s saved us both in money and headaches.”Angela HawkinsOwner and Founder\"Before I found Saltbox my entire condo, garage, and spare bedroom at my parents' house was lined with boxes and garbage bags full of inventory and I didnt know how to even open and sort thru everything. When I went looking for options for a storage and/or work location for my business, Saltbox not only offered me space at a reasonable rate but they host small business crash-courses on-site and have so many answers to logistics I didn't even know I was going to encounter as I started really scaling my business. I absolutely love the staff at my location and the flexibility they offer for scaling up or down is such a mental relief. I love being a member at Saltbox!\"Michelle MildredFounder\"Having someone accept shipments at our Saltbox warehouse allows us to focus more on growing the business instead of waiting around for packages and freight to arrive.\"Ken RobinsonGeneral Manager\nDallas, Carrollton\nPhoenix\nLos Angeles, Duarte\nAtlanta, Upper Westside\nWashington D.C.\nDallas, Farmers Branch\nMiami\nDenver\nAtlanta, Westside Park\nSeattle\nMinneapolis\nLos Angeles, Torrance\nDenver\nWashington D.C.\nDallas, Carrollton\nPhoenix\nAtlanta, Westside Park\nDallas, Farmers Branch\nSeattle\nMinneapolis\nLos Angeles, Duarte\nAtlanta, Upper Westside\nMiami\nLos Angeles, Torrance\nAtlanta, Upper Westside\nMinneapolis\nLos Angeles, Torrance\nSeattle\nDenver\nDallas, Carrollton\nLos Angeles, Duarte\nWashington D.C.\nDallas, Farmers Branch\nMiami\nAtlanta, Westside Park\nPhoenix\nFind your new workspace todayJoin a community of businesses working to shape the future of ecommerce and entrepreneurship.Speak to an expertBook a tour\nNot ready to join your local Saltbox yet?Access exclusive carriers and save on shipping with the Parsel app.Try ParselSaltbox for\nEarly stage startupsFast growing brandsScaling businessesSaltbox services\nLogistics servicesParsel AppSaltbox spaces\nWarehouse spacesOffice spacesCommunities amenitiesGet involved\nPartnershipsReferralsCommunity\nBlogMembers storiesinformation\nCompanyFAQ’sCareersContact uslocations\nLos Angeles, DuarteLos Angeles, TorrancePhoenixSeattleDenverDallas, CarrolltonDallas, Farmers BranchMinneapolisAtlanta, Upper WestsideAtlanta, Westside ParkWashington D.C.MiamiSaltbox SpacesWarehouse suitesOffice suitesCommunity spacesSaltbox ServicesLogistics servicesParsel Shipping PlatformSaltbox ForEarly stage startupsFast growing brandsScaling businessesLocationsLos Angeles, DuarteLos Angeles, TorrancePhoenixSeattleDenverDallas, CarrolltonDallas, Farmers BranchMinneapolisAtlanta, Upper WestsideAtlanta, Westside ParkWashington D.C.MiamiGet involvedPartnershipsReferralsCommunityBlogMembers storiesInformationCompanyFAQ’sCareersContact us\nNot ready to join your local Saltbox yet?Access exclusive carriers and save on shipping with the Parsel app.Try ParselHQ Address:169 Madison Ave 2041 New York, NY 10016Contact:info@saltbox.com\n© 2024 Saltbox.

The human element, Premonition claims, is worth an average 30.70% increase in win rate, which translates to substantial savings for clients.”\n“Law has historically been a credence good. This means the market relies on elite credentials and firm reputation as a proxy for skill.”\nProfessor William Henderson, Maurer School of Law\n“I do not have to tell you the significant and revolutionary role Premonition.ai is playing in altering the landscape of the profession.”\nProfessor Michael Hunter Schwartz, University of Arkansas at Little Rock\n“Like other disruptive technologies, Premonition has the capacity to completely recalibrate the way in which clients instruct legal professionals and legal professionals instruct each other.”\n“For our legal financing opportunities, Premonition delivers a quantitative analysis of legal risks that is unique and provides invaluable insight.”\nAdrian Chopin, ORCHARD GLOBAL Asset Management LLP\n“Told my attorney she had a great record in front of Judge Doherty and the Plaintiffs Counsel did not.

(I usually find shoving a pencil through my ear more gratifying)! I really do like the service that we have been getting from your company.  You can thank Jim Bullard, the owner of Interim Healthcare in Lubbock for suggesting I try your service!Brad SwensonThank you! Have used LSO for many years. Not 1 complaint. We appreciate ya’ll.Christine KDee was PERFECTION!!! Fast, qualified, prepared, friendly, knowledgeable and very friendly! A breath of fresh air! Kudos to you and her!Dave GarciaA Texas-based company with Texas employees, providing stellar Texas-friendly service on a daily basis. I use LSO three times a week and usually, everything gets to its destination on time or early, but the important part is that, if something goes wrong, I can reach a live person almost instantly and they always stay with my problem until it’s solved. Every time. With a smile. Can’t beat that with a stick.Diana DowI love having LSO deliver my packages. I can actually communicate with them by phone. Jessica just did a tremendous job in tracking my package and making sure it was delivered within my specified time frame. LSO is head over heels better than the other two.Don CookI don’t even have to enter a contest to validate how great LSO is! We at the San Antonio Salvation Army utilize Lone Star & have for years. I used to work at our Divisional HQ in Dallas & always knew when we got a package from SA because it was always in an LS envelope. After transferring here, I quickly understood why. I use the automated system for packaging slips & pick-up. Customer service has always efficiently assisted me with any problems.Geneva MurphyWe have been Lone Star customers for many years. They meet our demanding expectations.Haydeline SolisWe highly recommend LSO for all business and home deliveries.Howard BielGreat company. I received notification that I was to receive delivery but I was going on vacation that same day. I called to let LSO know and they arranged to get my delivery to me early. The woman I spoke to on the phone and the driver who delivered my parcel were both so polite and helpful. I would not hesitate to recommend this company!!Jackie CThe extra level of service by a regional carrier such as LSO makes the difference in gaining and maintaining clients.John TOur firm, McCall, Parkhurst & Horton, has been an LSO customer for 30 years, and we have always appreciated your service and staff, but tonight your employees went way beyond your great company and service, and we thank you. Please let the San Antonio courier Manager, the Customer Service Representative, and the courier know how much we appreciate getting our package picked up after it was accidentally deposited in the LSO bin shortly after the 6:00 pm deadline. We called customer service to see if the courier could come back, and they did!! Your dutiful customer service rep, Andrea (I think that is her name) and your night Manager and the pickup person, should all be acknowledged as exemplary team members and recognized by LSO. Again, thank you, and we are loyal customers and so appreciate your loyalty to us to get the job done of delivering our package to Austin Monday morning. Again, so grateful, and thank you for having employees that care.Kathy S. cooperOur trust in them has been unblemished.keith patricioWe have exceptional response times with LSO. The nature of our business, plus our steady business growth, requires a number of capabilities in the regional shipping partner we choose – reliability, responsiveness, flexibility and price – to name a few.Maryann StoddardWe take shipping seriously.

She went out of her way to make sure my package is delivered today. It’s very refreshing to know there are still people around in this day and age who are outstanding in the jobs they hold.

I am extremely pleased with the service that our company received. Kevin first communicated with another employee from my company. I was then given Kevin's contact information and quote. Within the hour, everything was all set up, and within less than 2 hours - the item was picked up from the warehouse and on its way to the customer. Kevin was very professional, thorough in his communication, and very friendly and pleasant to speak with on the phone. I will definitely be doing business with them again in the future!!\nAffiliated Water\nWonderful experience — Kevin Carpenter is a fabulous customer service rep. We needed the services for an URGENT IMMEDIATE SITUATION. He and his team jumped right on it and got everything taken care of very quickly and so professionally. We made our deadline time even with lots of hiccups on the pickup location and they still came through. I would recommend this company to anyone.\nLisa Carter\nSun-Maid Growers of California\nWow is all I can say! Found you through Google. Filled out the online request and received a PROMPT reply. The quote was received quickly. We were able to book with you faster than we had anticipated. BOL was also provided - saving us time and hassle. And the shipment status was relayed to us throughout its journey. The pick up driver was courteous and the custom van was rigged to slide a palletized shipment in effortlessly! And talk about good old fashioned customer service — it is alive and well with your employees! Thank you Chris Noe!!! You are the BOMB! I know who we will call if we ever need a \"hot shot\" shipment service again! Thank you for having your \"act\" together with your service!\nColumbus Fan & Machine Corp.\nI had an emergency shipment that needed a non-stop hot shot delivery run from Texas to California and they were able to get it picked up from the warehouse within one hour of me calling. I worked with Justin P., and received great service and communication, and these guys are awesome in a rush. Everything went smoothly and delivery was made right on time. Would recommend!\nThomson Air Conditioning\nAn absolute lifesaver. Steve was a dream to work with. I phoned him after leaving our passports in a Las Vegas hotel and needed a same day pick up and delivery to Los Angeles in order to make our flight home that night back to New Zealand. Dealing with some very unhelpful Hotel staff, Steve's fantastic driver diligently located and collected my items and swiftly had them to me personally at our Los Angeles Hotel lobby. I am extremely grateful to have found a company who were able to help me out of a very stressful situation. They are caring, professional and I would highly recommend using them.\nMag & Turbo\nBest service for product transport and delivery! Kevin was in touch with me via text constantly with updates and responses as soon as I sent them! He got me the highlight piece for a wedding overnight from New York to San Francisco, CA! Something no one was willing to guarantee! He made sure I got my delivery done at night, when I even gave him leeway for an early morning delivery if it came to it! I mean this company and especially Kevin are amazing! And really really came through! Plus they were reasonable as compared to FedEx and UPS! And much much MUCH easier and more personal to work with! I didn't have to talk to hear a computer or navigate through a pre-automated answering service!

Reberger\nAs an export company dealing with clients overseas I spend half of my days delivering packages to freight forwarders. Comet Delivery has become the solution to my problems allowing me more time to spend with my customers. When I call to have a damaged box inspected or change in address for a package to be delivered, the Comet team is always more than accommodating. I would highly recommend Steven and his team at Comet Delivery.\nA. Ray\nComet Delivery provided excellent service in a critical time. We first used them to pick up medical reports from Martin County North Hospital in Stuart and drive them directly to a specialist in Miami, (111 miles). They were there in 2 hours. The following day they picked up the medical files from the specialist and drove them to UM Medical Center. Perfect service both times in a critical situation.

While a quote may appear inexpensive, what are the hidden costs to you, your company, and your customers? …How can you limit the frequency of these unwanted expenses?Learn more by exploring the insights below.missing freightWhy do carriers lose my freight?Other carriers use the same barcode on each piece of your shipment. When pieces go missing, they’re difficult to locate because each scan looks identical. In contrast, our TRUETRAKTM system assigns a unique barcode to each handling unit. This gives us more precise tracking so you have fewer headaches with missing freight.Start Shipping With UsDamaged freight Why do carriers damage my freight?Reasons a carrier might damage your freight.1Load CapacityEvery carrier tries to maximize load capacity (cubic space and weight), as they should-- it's fiscally and environmentally responsible. What sets carriers apart is their technique in pursuing this target. Many stack freight directly on top of your product or try to cram freight into tight spaces.We securely mount freight onto load bars, avoiding the potential of crushing freight beneath it. This precaution helps us fill trailer volume while reducing damage so we can deliver freight to your customer instead of a landfill.2CultureHuman error accounts for a portion of unintentional damage by carriers. How well does your carrier manage the frequency and severity of this human error?We carefully hire like-minded individuals who have a balanced attitude towards safety, quality, and productivity. Then we give them the tools and training to successfully protect your product in a fast-paced LTL environment.3PackagingLTL freight is handled many times in transit and shares trailer space with various other commodities. Packaging your product adequately to withstand the rigors of LTL shipping will reduce the likelihood of damage. Some of the most common packaging oversights are freight that overhangs the pallet, unprotected loose freight, product that's not properly secured to the pallet, and top-heavy freight with an insufficient base.We dislike claims just as much as shippers. Damage not only involves freight but also injures reputations and relationships. Our Sales and Operations team members can provide valuable input while partnering with you to protect your product.Start Shipping With UsDelayed freight Why do carriers delay my freight?There are three main reasons carriers delay your fright.1Low Route DensityMost carriers only deliver to rural locations when they have enough freight built up, leaving your customer wondering when or if they'll receive their shipment. For predictability, our remote points get a scheduled service day, so customers know exactly when to expect their freight. In addition, our high-density coverage allows us to service rural locations more frequently and consistently than competitors.2MisroutesAnother reason freight could get delayed is misrouting. Human error while loading trailers is unavoidable. Generally, carriers catch these errors once freight reaches the incorrect terminal which often causes your freight to be delayed multiple days.Through use of barcode scanning on our docks, if freight is initially misloaded, system alerts notify us immediately. This allows us to correct the mistake before it becomes a service issue.3Lane CapacityYour freight could also be delayed due to lane capacity. When carriers see an influx in requests, your freight may not receive top priority, causing your shipment to be held until capacity becomes available.Two-thirds of our customers submit requests electronically. Our drivers also send electronic versions of BOLs while on their route. This allows us to see early indicators of heavy lanes with time to react and adjust capacity when possible.Start Shipping With Ustruckloadsolutions thatdeliver results tailored solutions   •   dedicated service   •   trusted partnersWe've expanded See Our Locations\nNew ShipmentsQuoteQuick Pick UpSet-Up ShipmentsAddress BookShippedTrack A ShipmentShipping HistoryEmail AlertsFile a ClaimInvoices‍Shipping PortalResourcesTransit TimesLocationsPoints LIst XLSPoints List PDFDensity CalculatorRules TariffTerms of UseAccessorial ChargesFormsFuel SurchargeHoliday ScheduleAPI/EDI DocumentationTeam ResourcesPrivacy PolicyAboutWho We AreLocationsNewsCareersOpen PositionsWhy Join Us?ContactPhone: (800) 521-0287cs@ccfs.com©CrossCountry Freight SolutionsREVIEW US ON FOLLOW US ONShipping Portal / Log InNew to our online tools?

Said:\nNo hassle and Reduced Cost\nGoShare is my now go-to for transporting materials. We manufacture building materials that require testing at 3rd party test facilities.  Before we would fly someone into the town and rent a truck.  Now with GoShare we simply arrange a day before and the next morning materials are delivered with no hassle and reduced cost on our end. Thank you GoShare!!!\nCarmen A. Said:\nLove GoShare\nLove GoShare! I purchased furniture at Homegoods.  I was in direct communication with a GoShare rep as it was July 2 a holiday weekend. I driver accepted for next day when Homegoods opened.  I spoke to the driver and you get updates to your cellphone.  I will continue to use GoShare for all me delivery needs. The cost of transport was very reasonable too!\nRebekah B. Said:\nGreat, No Hassle Service\nThis is a great service. We booked online and the request was accepted within minutes. A few hours later our driver picked up our couch at Home Sense with no issues and delivered on time at our home shortly after.  Such a great no hassle service and our delivery guy was great!\nCrystal B. Said:\nSuper Easy, Convenient and Fast\nSuper easy. Convenient and fast. I was needing a pickup and delivery of a package so of course I went to Google and found GoShare. Being reluctant,  I did it, and the outcome was great. If you are in need of a quick, super easy and convenient delivery company GoShare is your company.  I'm from Atlanta, GA I did try reaching out to other companies before this with no response.  GoShare allowed me to do everything straight from the app, including track my package.  Thank You GoShare.\nDimitar B. Said:\nPrompt, Professional, Friendly\nGoShare was recommended in store by Bob's Discount Furniture. Signing up through the Apple iPhone App Store was easy. The process is intuitive and as simple as possible. I requested a service before we left the store - 10 minutes from start to finish. We were linked to a transport company within 10 minutes before we managed to leave the plaza. The service we received was prompt, professional, friendly, accurate and with great care. Will recommend to any friend who needs fast, reliable transport avoiding the overpriced premiums of others. Will definitely use again.\nFrancesca P. Said:\nGoShare is incredible\nGoShare is incredible.  I have used them three times now and every time they are getting me out of a bind in such an efficient and cost effective way!  This third time I used bigger truck - with one day's notice! - that was clean and big and the driver and helper were fantastic.  And it was a long distance delivery!  I am so tired of the pricing and rigidity of the traditional moving industry.  I am so grateful for GoShare.\nBrittany L. Said:\nHelpful and Professional\nGreat service! Downloaded the app and my furniture was picked up and delivered in about an hour! Musa, our driver, was helpful and professional. It's kinda like the Uber for furniture (or other heavy duty items) delivery! Highly recommend.\nAndy S. Said:\nOn Demand Courier and Freight Services\nI had been looking for a service that could provide on demand courier and freight services for my business. I came across GoShare through a Google search and could not be happier with the service thus far. I've done about a dozen orders in the past few weeks and each time the driver has been on time or early, friendly, and very helpful.\nWill J. Said:\nGreat App\nGoShare is the Uber of when you need a \"truck or a van and a guy\". Great App. Fast Response. and reasonably priced. This will become more & more popular when the word gets out. I had a guy come out with a beautiful new cargo van he bought just to be a GoShare Driver.  Great attitude and excellent service.\nBeth V. Said:\nGreat Service!\nI have found pieces of furniture at Home Goods in the past but neglected to purchased due to not having the right truck to transport- yesterday I found 2 gorgeous pieces to use in our rental home at the beach & was so happy to see the advertisement right there on top of the tv cabinet I wanted- I signed up while waiting in line & just had both pieces delivery by Henry! Very professional & punctual! Love this service & will ask for Henry in the future!\nCurran D. Said:\nAmazing Service, Fair Prices\nLoved my first experience with this company and app. The driver was able to pick up the furniture on his own without me having to meet at the store I bought the furniture from, which was convenient with my busy schedule. The driver took very good care of the furniture, using blankets and tie downs. The driver also helped move it into my house, and wow was it heavy. The driver went above and beyond, I couldn't be more pleased with this app. Thanks for running a great service.\nM. Panday Said:\nProfessional and Punctual\nHad a wonderful experience using GoShare to get a power recliner sofa with 6 big boxes delivered from local Costco store to my apartment. The individuals were very professional and punctual. The Goshare platform was simple and straight forward and I got response within minutes of submitting move request. I would recommend anyone looking to do moves or pickup to use their services. In fact while at Costco many people enquires about how and what I am using to move. The plus was that the platform allows you to add a helper to your request.
