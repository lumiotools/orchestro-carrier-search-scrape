Had to start an inquiry thru the HM Passport office in England.  They found a notice saying the passport was delivered to my house on 16 Oct and was signed off on by me. Fabrication, never signed off on anything. DHL made it up.  After hours and hours of trying to find out what happened I now have to apply again for another passport. DHL lied about the delivery.

They left my heavy item, weighted 3x kg to my neighbour. They said that nothing they can offer and asked me to bring the heavy item back to my house which involves some steps up and down. What\u2019s the point to allow recipient to change delivery date if you can\u2019t able to offer such service! A terrible and disgusting shipping company!

Tell me why this delivery driver is on my camera walking to the SIDEWALK, turning around, and walking back to the truck. No attempt to knock at the door 5 feet in front of him. I called customer service. Apparently there\u2019s no possible way to get in touch with the driver. I\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s ridiculous. There absolutely is but they just want to take the piss.

Got contacted by somebody to contact them back, so they can 'HELP'. Spoke to a lady over a chat, she took all the details and said the person responsible will contact me within 24 hours for updates. It has been a week AND OF COURSE NOBODY DID. Today I contacted them again to find out what is going on and I have been told that THE CASE HAS BEEN CLOSED AS THEY LOST THE PARCEL AND THAT'S IT. My money gone, my parcel gone, my belongings gone and they didn't even bothered to let me know as they mentioned within 24 hours, but decided to close the case. ABSOLUTE JOKE, HORRIBLE SERVICES AND AS I USED FEDEX FOR THE FIRST TIME I WILL MAKE SURE I WILL NEVER USE THEIR SERVICES AGAIN AND MAKE SURE WILL SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT THIS. Even Evri or Yodel did better then FedEx, WOW!!!",

She even lies and says in her report that the side of the street, where anything could be easily stolen or ruined by mud, rain and snow is leaving it on our front porch.  This is rediculous.  She knows this is completely unacceptable yet has done it at least 4 times now.  Amazon and UPS understand the difference between front porch and filthy ditch on the street.

The delivery manager page doesn't function and the overall experience is so horrible that I will never again buy from retailers who use fedex. Over ten years of poor to no delivery of my goods. Over 50% of my deliveries from fedup, either are lost or require additional days spent waiting because of the high error rate of the tracking system which often states that it has no information about my package.

I clicked on the FedEx tracking number, and indeed it indicated that my order would arrive on November 13th by end of day. Around 3:00pm today, November 13th, I checked the tracking again, and my order never indicated that it is out for delivery. I even used the FedEx chat to check on the order which said I should expect my order today. I decided to call their support because the online tracking never showed the order was out for delivery. Well low and behold, I was told that my order was never scheduled to be delivered today that it's scheduled for tomorrow by 5 pm. So basically FedEx lied when they said my order would arrive today. First of all I despise FedEx, they are the private sector equivalent to the USPS. A very poor run company, and from all the one star reviews I see here on Trustpilot, I know I'm right. So, I called Walmart Customer Service to informed them that FedEx actions will most likely cause me to never order online from them again. I don't need the aggravation. If I never got the email stating my order was coming today, everything would be fine.",

I am lucky that the staff to my apartment complex are so nice to help me, because FedEx didn't do anything to help. They just told me, \"we'll just mark it down that we will make sure that this won't happen again and we're sorry for the inconvenience.\" That was a horrible experience that day and I dread if any package I order if it's a large package gets this carrier. UPS does their job to actually follow instructions and delivers to the address that is listed, even if it is a huge apartment complex, so why not FedEx? It's because they hire lazy delivery drivers that don't care what happens to people's packages or if a person can easily retrieve their package if it's larger than a small or medium package. Definitely the worst delivery carrier.",

The call center representative was giving me lame excuses as to why the delivery person couldn\u2019t leave the package at my door. Now I have to deal with another driver, more headaches and maybe have my package sent back to Walmart. All because I don\u2019t have a car or time to head out to your aldergrove location to get my package all because I work. Thanks a lot fedex you have terrible service",

The place where it was delivered to had returned it to Amazon Shipping with my correct post code amended  on it. Amazon then redelivered it straight back to them have scrubbed out their amendment and putting the original WRONG postcode back on it, so they sent it back to Amazon again, did a bit of detective work,found my details online and emailed to tell me they had sent the package back to Amazon again.  Zara dont want to know. I have spent nearly 3/4 hour on a Chat with Amazon trying to get them to put me in contact with my local depot. That request was ignored several times and I was told to contact ZARA who just hang up on me. It really isn't impossible to contact the local depot, locate the parcel (you'd hope there isn't a mountain of long forgotten parcels to sift through) and redirect it to me. The really frustrating part of this fiasco is that the day the parcel went missing Amazon had delivered two other parcels to me at 6:30pm before swanning off and dumping my parcel ten miles away underneath the signpost for another village - not my village, not my road or even the same name as my road, and definitely not the same door number. So beating my head against a brick wall will get me further than trying to resolve this with Amazon. Absolue rubbish service",

They have refused to repair something that they caused damage to, and now are not communicating with me. They claim on their website that they will cover damages. This is false and misleading.",

        "review_content": "I THOUGHT Dolly.com was my hero. I've spent the past week straight packing and loading up my entire life into a 15' truck and moving from the Bay Area to LA, with help from friends here n there. But the bulk of it I've done alone. Needless to say, I'm exhausted. So by the time I arrived in LA I decided you know what, I'm going to hire movers to help me do the unloading so that I could focus on cleaning and preparing, as I had to be at work the next morning. So I looked online for same day moving help, and dolly.com was one of the first ones that came up.It was between 2:30-3pm on Tuesday, I booked and paid up front for two workers for 2 hours, to arrive at 6pm. I still had a lot to do, so I spent next 3 hours looking for refrigerator, taking care of some work on my laptop, and I even went to the store to buy some waters for the workers & to Harbor Freight to purchase a dolly to help them with the unloading. On my way back home, I received a call from Dolly at 5:52 pm saying that they did not have team members to assist with my job, and informed me that they would be able to find me some team members tomorrow. I could not believe what I was hearing. I informed the representative that tomorrow was not possible, as the truck needed to be returned tonight, and that I would be returning to work tomorrow. I was devastated. I told her that they should have informed me much earlier in the day, as I have now wasted 3 hours of daylight that I could have used to unload the truck that needed to be returned that same evening. Although she did seem sympathetic, and did say that I would receive a full refund, which now being Thursday, the charge is still pending.I hope that I don't have issues with the refund.Dolly is UNRELIABLE  and UNPROFESSIONAL. Granted I only booked 3 hrs in advance, but they advertise  \"on-demand/same day\" service in Google search, which is misleading. There is NO excuse for them to have waited nearly 3hrs, only 8mins before the job began to inform me that there would be no job.",

Again no moving essentials provided and 2 men nothing else. Did bring a little girl tho!! They broke my stair when they dropped my elliptical and I put in a claim. Movers didn\u2019t even apologize but sure sent that tip reminder.

Also, I scheduled a Thumbtack pro to assemble the piece of furniture the following day at 2:30 PM, and I had to cancel 24 hours in advance not to incur a cancellation fee. Because the driver texted me that he was on his way, I thought everything was fine. Now I need to pay $50 to Thumbtack (which is only fair, not faulting them), find a new mover with enough insurance for my building, get the COI approved, and work my way onto the freight elevator schedule.

I paid for 1 driver and 1 helper, I received a 2 in 1, driver and helper combined. Why would they send one person to manage to HEAVY ASS cocktail table. When the driver arrived at my home he struggled with the table after knocking down a piece of existing furniture in my home. I was informed by Dolly that I would receive a refund for not having proper help. Within an hour of my delivery I received an email stating we regret to inform you that we can not issue a credit @this time. DO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE THEY ARE F$#?

Then when  the move is completed they charge you for the full amount. Then you have to wait between one and three business days for that hold to fall off your account. On my fourth business day I contacted Dolly. This was 02/15/2024 because the hold hadn\u2019t fallen off my account. The customer service agent said he put in a request with his supervisor so that money could be credited back to my bank account.

They could not find any workers to do thr job. Which I didn't even know was how the job is done. I had to keep calling to check the status of my delivery and each time they kept saying, \"we don't have any workers\". I was confused because how the heck doesn't a company have workers? Bob's furniture didn't explain to me how this company operates so I was confused. We rescheduled the delivery time frame 3 times on 3/2. By 6 pm, I was over it. They rescheduled the delivery for the following day for 11-1pm. It is now almost 2pm and still I received NO UPDATES and NO FURNITURE!!! I called back to inquire about the delivery and once again they replied, \"we have no workers\". To make matters worse, I ordered the delivery on Wednesday and NOTHING has gone as planned. They are unprofessional, are unable to honor their commitments and when you call, are unable to provide you with updates or possible suggestions. The representative are CLUELESS about ways to best help their customers. I'm seconds away from getting a Uhaul and moving the furniture myself (as I live alone).I ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS COMPANY! It has inconvenienced me in so many ways waiting for my furniture to arrive. I will NEVER recommend this company to ANYONE! I wouldn't care if the person was moving bags!STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!",

        "review_content": "Dolly is the worst experience you\u2019ll have moving. I will never ever move from them again, let alone purchase something from a retail store that requires them to be the delivery service. Background: I purchased a 3 piece sectional sofa that needed to be delivered 12 miles, and the store partnered with Dolly to be the delivery service.Scheduled Dolly for Tuesday 10am-2pm as my building has a strict rule of no , and take time off work during the delivery window. Multiple \u201chelpers\u201d message me saying they requested delivery just waiting for dolly to respond.Dolly eventually calls me and says they can\u2019t find a helper. Wait what?? That makes no sense. I ask to be escalated to a manager or supervisor and get told \u201cno\u201d. Over 2 hours is spent on the phone and I get told to pretty much eat dirt.Eventually I reschedule it to Wednesday 10am-1pm, again taking more time off work. I had a flight this afternoon at 5pm (was not a concern given that Dolly was scheduled have delivered item the 24 hours before the flight)A helper finally picks my request. I feel relieved as messages me he should be available latest 1pm after his first dolly, and he is aware of my 4pm cutoff time + flight.Except, Dolly scheduled him that morning to drive over to Long Island, 2 hours away. My helper informs me that because of traffic he can\u2019t get here until 4:30pm. I call customer service saying this won\u2019t work out let\u2019s please reschedule again. The rep Gregory McIntosh tells me since a helper already accepted I cannot cancel as he\u2019s in the way and stuck in trafficOkay, well my building has a strict 4pm rule, this delivery was scheduled to be done from 10am-1pm, and you already didn\u2019t deliver my item yesterday. I literally get told \u201cyou should have read the terms and conditions\u201d.Again: If Dolly has your delivery coming 4 hours later than originally told (and that doesn\u2019t work), be prepared to eat you Dolly fee despite Dolly screwing up.I end up having to wait for my helper to deliver my item at 4:30pm. Overall here is my experience with dolly:- 8 hours of PTO used for nothing- 3-4 hours on the phone with \u201ccustomer support\u201d, including being hung up on once- 1 rescheduled flight at the cost of $200- 1 couch delivered 30 hours late- 5 different times I had to reschedule my service elevator with my buildingI can\u2019t say this company has the worst customer service because they don\u2019t have any real customer service. I will never ever use Dolly again, and will refuse doing business with a company if they require me to use Dolly.",

For example, a bottle priced at $17 at Dan Murphy\u2019s costs $22 on DoorDash, plus a delivery fee. Similarly, sushi priced at $14 for in-store pickup is $19 on the app. This markup makes it hard to justify the convenience \u2013 it feels like we\u2019re paying a premium on top of a premium.",

How could you hold on to folks money after completing deliveries I'm a timely manner.  If there are securities issues , they should stop the delivery and address issues promptly and not putting customers at risk .   You can't be holding on folks money after working for you. This.

DoorDash over charges customers when they order and under pays the delivery drivers. Most customers don't tip because DoorDash says: free delivery. It's the dashers time, vehicle wear and tear, gasoline ect and dashers get only $2 pay from DoorDash. Getting paid per hour would be a rip off too. I only DoorDash when we need extra money. Oh and peak pay is very rare. DoorDash takes out around $70 at tax time.",

The refund was not enough to cover the missing items ($37/$100 order), which I didn\u2019t even want a refund, I wanted someone to go back 2 miles to pick up the rest of our dinner so my three children under 4 could eat. We were stuck at an airport hotel and had no way to get dinner. After multiple super frustrating calls with doordash, I opened up the two items and it had fish (instead of tofu). Sigh.

Ill be filing a charge back with my bank and I suggest everyone else with similar issues to do the same! And don't EVER believe them if they tell you to order first cuz your code is not working and then they will refund the coupon amount to you cuz they lie about that too!! I even took screenshots where the rep told me to go ahead and order and then they would refund me the coupon since it was not working but was valid and even seeing the screenshot with a message from THEIR rep telling me this, they STILL refuse to give me the credit for the coupon now!

I was immediately disconnected and they charged my credit card the $9.99 unauthorized amount and I cancelled membership.They still cheated me out of $9.99 and were unresponsive to my complaint.This is Consumer theft and should not be allowed. It is Fraud! Do not use Door Dash for Delivery Service!Deceptive Practice - Don't Care About Consumers. This review is based on my personal experience and I stand on it \ud83d\udcaf percent.

        "review_title": "Refused to properly compensate me for missing items",
        "review_content": "I made a huge order through doordash from McDonalds. A couple of my items were missing from my delivered order. The missing items was an entire large meal plus an extra order of fries. I was charged for over 15 dollars for these missing items (im not including the costs of sales tax, delivery fees, doordash fee, and tip for the driver). I notified doordash, hoping they could re-deliver the missing items (at no additional cost to me), but they refused. Giving me only the option of doordash credits. Worse, they credited me only $6.17. Since they refused to have my (missing) food items sent to me, and since they made me accept their credits as my only option, I would think they would have to reimburse me in full. $6.17 in credits for something that cost me over 15 dollars just doesn't suffice. I appealed, and made a complaint and they bumped up my credit from $6.17 to $9.72. This still isn't a full, proper reimbursement. So, I kept on complaining to doordash, demanding they reimburse me in full. Their agents just would tell me things like they're kicking my complaint upstairs to their special team (assuming they even exist) and/or it would take 24 hours for a resolution, things like that. But I never heard back, let alone got my credits properly increased to what I'm truly owed. After getting a run around from one of their agents, I'd re-apply my complaint with a new agent. After a few times of this and not getting any resolution (well, according to them, they resolved my issue. But not properly according to me.), I finally threw in the towel. They just dug in their heels and refused to properly compensate me without openly saying so. I'm sure multi-billion dollar door dash (10 billion annual revenue. market cap: 71 billion) needs the 6 extra dollars they still owe me more than I do. Lousy crooks.",

I received multiple cancellation notices from DD.  The order was already late.  I contacted the driver who did not speak English, but managed to explain that he had not yet picked up my order from Outback.  I told him that I believed the order was canceled.  He tried to reach DD, but no one answered his calls.  To be on the safe side, I put a cancellation on the order.  I ordered hamburgers from Chili\u2019s, and after we finished eating them, the driver showed up with the cold steaks.  We did not accept the meal.  I chatted with 3 different DD representatives, who refused to grant a refund.  Also, DD erased the communication screen showing their multiple cancellation notices, then it claimed I lacked evidence showing the notices were sent.  Buyer Beware.",

I understand things happen, and I reached out to customer service online which promptly said they couldnt help me and disconnected. I called the support number and was put on hold ten times over 47 minutes, then told they would have a supervisor reach out that never did. Bad Business. Bad Customer Service and I question how legal it is to take an apple pay agreed amount and then up charge.",

Excuse me? How are you to say what is or isn't a demand for a customer's order? How are you able to deceive the customer and still continue business? How are you able to only have arbitration boards and no one can actually use you? Over and over again you are consistently not even slapped on the hand and allowed to pay out pennies to the dollar to end these court cases taking absolutely zero responsibility in the mess that you've caused?. Out of my 40 plus years of being in this world this is by far the most disgusting business practices I have ever seen.

This company has a fake escalation team that does not even communicate with you continue to deny your request to have your refund back to you. When I never received the order when you put a note in the description these dashes does not even listen to that. This company has broke policies . And refusing to return my money back to. And all these supervisors are not trained as a professional personnel. When they state to me they can't do anything about it it's a problem. Besides make a complaint who does that it's a horrible service. Food be tampered with from these dashers. So to for them to make a falsifies statement like that it's not correct. They that I am not eligible for a refund on a order that has never got received to me has not provided no photo has not provided me absolutely no compensation or anything This company should not be operating at all they should be closed. Unfortunately this is a very bad business they are not but a scammer. And they refuse to return your money. It takes up to 2 weeks for them to return your money. Then they sit here and screen the phone call. I am a very unhappy customer I don't like how business is being ran have very poor service. And I never seen no company when you request to talk to a supervisor. The only thing they say that oh a supervisor will give you a call back within 24 hours. Then customer service is going to basically sit here and try to argue with you about the issue and try to State the policies. Customer service and supervisors are very unprofessional they hang up the call on you.",

One of the most Rudest encounters I\u2019ve had just occurred and I am furious. I placed and order Oct 26, and it was cancelled. I was provided with 2 options to either receive a credit or a refund and I opted for the Refund. I reached out to your team right after I selected the refund and asked how long it take and if I could switch my options. The agent explained why he couldn\u2019t do it and I understood. Fast forward to today, I have no sign of a refund much less any tracking of the funds even coming out. However, if I had taken the immediate credit then I would have that same money in my account to use. The banks send me back to you guys so I inquired about my money. I\u2019m sorry but the Rudeness was uncalled for especially when I\u2019m extremely frustrated.",

I hung up. the next thing you know the man called me back time and time again calling me names and saying more and more nasty things.

        "review_content": "This is the email I sent to DoorDash and they will do nothingOn November 3, we ordered two pizzas at approximately 6:00 from a restaurant that is about a 20 minute drive away.  There was an increased delivery fee because of the distance which we were aware of however, our pizzas were picked up about 20-25 minutes later by one of your \u201cdrivers\u201d and he didn\u2019t arrive until over an hour later.  Unbelievably the reason was that he was delivering on a bicycle \u2013 a distance that is a 20 minute drive!  By that time, the pizzas were soggy, cold and inedible.  We tried to contact customer support but only got automated offer of a $5.00 credit.  As you can see on the attached receipt, between the fees and tip to the so-called \u201cdriver\u201d, we paid $29.00 to have food delivered which we couldn\u2019t eat. I called customer service on Monday and explained the whole situation and she said she was the wrong person to talk to and was transferring me to the correct person.  That person, instead of interrupting me, let me go through the whole problem before telling me she was the wrong person because she was dasher support.  She certainly could tell I wasn\u2019t a dasher when I started to tell her the problem.  She said she was transferring me once again and I waited on hold for quite a while.  She then came back on the line and said no one was answering but someone would call me back in 24 to 48 hours.  It has now been past that amount of time with no callback, no resolution. Because of this abysmal customer service experience \u2013 from your dasher to your customer service support team \u2013 I would like to see if we can get a refund for this order.  The email address for the account is xxxxxx.  Please advise if you can help.",

To make matters worse, he only gave me half of my order keeping the other half.

Well, half my delivered orders, if delivered at all because a handful don't get to me, are incorrect and i had complained often. They cannot figure out how to utilize accountability for the restaurants in the first place, otherwise this may not be much of a problem. But you gamble when you order from apps. im done. it's expensive anyway. The novelty is gone lol",

They still charged a $35.00 background check fee even though they never intended to approve the application. They gave the excuse that their APP says the fee in Non-Refundable but the APP also states that a Background Check would be performed AFTER approval and before the APP can be used. Low life companies like this just steal background fees from anyone who applies. I actually disputed the charge since it is ILLEGAL charging someone for something that you didn't provide. I will also be filing a complaint with the FTC so they can check out the scam they are playing on many drivers.",

I write an email saying this is unacceptable and I receive another automatic email that they will come on Thursday.  So, I am here at 9am, waiting.  I write them at 12pm and ask when they will arrive.  I receive another generic email that they will pick them up thursday, but now with another drivers plate number. If I hadn't written, they wouldn't have come at all. And they hide behind robots and 3rd party firms, so you can't really talk to anyone about it.  I would NOT recomend them to anyone.",

It was subcontracted to another delivery company. However the Portuguese company refused to call a French contact number and demanded a Portuguese phone number. After providing such and making arrangements for delivery, I waited the whole day without receiving any call on the Portuguese phone number. Still waiting, my package is insured and I will get reimbursed but what an inconvenience due to GEODIS incompetence. That company deserves the low rating, stay away from using them.",

Update: That said, I managed to contact a person at the Paris headquarters of Geodis who was quite sympathatic and cooperative and who promised to have a general manager get in touch with me to work out a new delivery at a time convenient for me. It's clear that some people in the company in Paris do care about customer service. Three stars out of five.",

So I waited 2 days at home for it (after the second day being told there had been an accident). Being that I work, and couldn't waste another day, Geodis recommended I pick a designated day that week, which I did... HOWEVER... Update (1 day later - 3 working days late): Have just had a David Lynch moment and received a notification saying that my parcel has been signed for, by 'myself' however I have not been home all day (this was not my 'new' designated delivery day). I will not be happy if this has been left with a neighbour as it clearly states to check the item thoroughly. Very stressful experience thus far.Update (later that evening)Well... Not to worry, it wasn't responsibly left with a neighbour as I just got home to find my \u00a3750+ digital piano hanging out, on my doorstep (in South East London) in the drizzle, in full view of any Tom, Brian or Harry, with the name of the product on full display and the box battered like a good piece of Weymouth cod.After unpacking the piano, everything seems to be ok, however it does sound a bit like soggy bagpipes, hopefully this will resolve itself as it dries out.If you want your goods dropped on your doorstep for all to see, whatever the weather, go for it. Bonne chance.",

        "review_content": "Avoid, avoid, avoid. For reference, I purchased a large expensive mirror from Maisons du Monde, and had no prior information that the courier company they deal with is Geodis. In short:Geodis is the most appalling courier company I have ever had to deal with. Hermes/DPD look like the saintliest of angels in comparison.1. The lack of pre-arrangement is beyond worrying (given Maisons du Monde sell expensive furniture items) and I had no way of tracking my item. When clicking on the tracking link in the email sent by Maisons du Monde, on the Geodis website it stated \"no consignment found\". A helpful start. 2. An unknown number of days later, I received a call from a random driver from DX Courier (who? where?!) who had my name and delivery but the completely wrong postcode and address. I had to rectify this by calling DX and having the correct address re-applied (the lady on the phone told me that the French aren't great with postcodes - how helpful for UK deliveries!!). She told me that I would be able to rearrange my delivery online with the same shipment number we both had recorded, but alas, this number did not provide any tracking on both DX and Geodis websites, naturally. **I am appalled at the lack of transparency as to where my delivery was, between different couriers, given it was a large, expensive item.**3. I rang Geodis to \"rearrange\" my delivery date as the driver from DX Courier told me there was nothing he could do. The person I called from Geodis seemed pretty ambivalent about the whole situation, and that an email would be sent out \"within the next couple of days\" to change my delivery date. 4. Just one day later, when I came home from work, my mirror was dumped outside my front door - I had no prior warning and no email to rearrange the date. This is disgusting business practice and the only reason I refuse to send this item back is because I do not want the hassle of dealing with Geodis again. Maisons du Monde should remove this courier from their services.",

Set up table. We asked for them to wait while we inspected so we could sing off. They said we didn't need to sign off and we could take up any issues with the company. The table was damaged. On the way out the drivers left a mess. This visual company lacks the process and infrastructure to provide an appropriate customer  experience.

One day the item sat in one location according to their map for an entire afternoon until I finally received a delivery attempt unsuccessful. My question is why get a job doing last mile if you don't want to deliver a backpack to an apartment building. What's the issue?  I've never left a negative review but this feels really annoying. I can't get a hold of a real person. I did receieve a  text from AMNINDER SINGH October 3 asking for door code. I texted back and also double checked delivery info - door code info was there. It's now 5 days later and I'm still waiting. Truck hasn't moved on map.  Not great",

This approach gives users the full power of a non-custodial wallet\u2014complete with essential features like WalletConnect\u2014right alongside the convenience of a personal IBAN account. While non-custodial services can sometimes be slightly slower or come with extra network fees, the ability to maintain complete control over your crypto holdings is well worth it and aligns perfectly with the core principles of cryptocurrency.Looking forward, with upcoming European regulations like MiCA, Nash appears well-positioned to thrive. From day one, they\u2019ve embraced a compliance-focused approach, setting a solid foundation for sustainable growth within the regulatory framework.I wholeheartedly recommend Nash to both beginners and intermediate users. They provide an incredibly straightforward gateway into and out of crypto, backed by a feature-rich wallet and the seamless functionality of an IBAN account.",

Very bad solution from a customer who actually used the services and shared the services with friends. I tried to contact you and solve the matter differently, but I realized that the prizes will not actually be paid due to a number of unusual actions that occurred: extension of the prize payment deadline to 30 days, announcement of the 2nd tranche of the prize payment, strange, inappropriate additional verifications or even logging out of the account. all users after the update where a large number of people had problems with logging in (they reserve the right to take over the funds if you do not have access to the account)",

        "review_content": "Nash may be good for the common users/traders, but it's just bad from an investor's point of view.Formerly Neon EXCHANGE, coming from an ICO where they raised $25.000.000 with the premise to create a groundbreaking regulated non-custodial exchange and to give 75% of the fees collected from the exchange to the investors. Sounds nice uh?It took about 2 years to get the exchange online, meanwhile, the hype about it died, the exchange was nice when it first got out, but then it has been totally abandoned, and now they say it was their choice, that the focus is on being a crypto BANK (yes, really).They refused to add new pairs to the exchange, they didn't add new features, bad marketing, they made a mobile app which is nice but it's not enough, they made a fiat ramp which is ok but not enough to compete with coinbase/binance/etc. even if you save a little in fees, and now they are trying to not drawn in a crypto space that meanwhile evolved at the speed of light (DeFi and better technologies).The result for the ICO investors who invested only for the dividends (because otherwise, the token is useless) is less than $100.000 volume per day, and the dividends in years have been near to zero.And good luck buying NEX tokens, they still couldn't list it in their exchange because \"we're a security, we are regulated\", switcheo dex is closed, tokok is shady, and uniswap liquidity is close to 0 and anyway no-one gives a monkeys about it because there's no point in buying NEX tokens, and of course the price reflects this, so guess what... It seems that being religiously regulated doesn't pay in the end.",

I have no idea when the order will actually come, completely ruining my planning for the rest of the day.

When I spoke to someone on the phone they mentioned they couldn't deliver the package because the area is inaccessible. I live on a public street, anyone can walk up to the front door so it was all BS. She promised to call me back and of course never did. STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY AS POSSIBLE. You'll never receive your items. I assume they're stealing them and making up excuses.",

I guess my repeated emails to customer service did some good, albeit they never answered me. Original Review: I had a package from Temu that was supposed to be delivered by May 6. At 10:57pm on May 6, the piggy ship driver uploaded 3 pictures of my package in his hand in his car and the package in his backseat and also a picture of some random person\u2018s front door with a random thin package on the ground, which obviously was not my door and not my package because my package was thick and bulky and contained a lot of items. Called piggy Customer Service and they don\u2019t answer the phone. All voicemail box are full. Emailed piggy for them to only tell me the package shows delivered in the system. I sent an email asking for an escalation for an investigation as to the driver\u2019s theft of my package and haven\u2019t heard back. I\u2019m so angry because 3 of the items I ordered or have been discontinued and I can no longer get on Temu!!",

I ordered thru temu before and the first two orders were delivered from piggyship, no issue those two times. Now, this third time i order, the driver is marking the deliveries as #1: failed delivery, no access code. i called piggyship and the number on their contact info on temu isnt even in service anymore. tried calling the the number they had provided on the recording....ended up on hold for 6 hrs. emailed piggyship and they only responded because i filed a complaint about the delivery issue to the BBB. temu said they contacted the driver and requested they come back here. #2 attempt: the driver marked the package as \"failed delivery. address is unaccessible. i reached out the same way as the first time but didnt stay on hold for more than 30 mins. im not staying on hold for 6 hrs again. so i emailed the bbb and told them the delivery issue still hasnt been resolved. I asked the manager and the employees of my apartment complex if someone from piggyship came to deliver a package to me and they said no. so i told them the same thing. the apartment complex  manager said it sounds like the delivery driver for the piggyship delivery company is planning on stealing my packages. currently waiting for the bbb to respond back. with the gate currently not working, the apartment complex left the gate wide open. i dont understand how the complex was not accessible when people are coming and going, as well as other delivery companies were able to deliver. even walmart delivers to tenants at my complex. unfortunately i too have a strong gut feeling that with there being an issue delivering my package, the delivery person marking \"no access code\" and \" address is not accessible\" when it is, has me getting extremely strong feelings that the delivery driver(s) handling my package is working on stealing my order.",

I will be calling the BBB / better business bureau tomorrow! I do not understand how TEMU or others continues to partner and ship with this last mile shipping company aka piggyship. There are complaints all over the internet. They are literally stealing peoples hard earned money / packages that are just MIA! No updated tracking info. My packages have been in their warehouse 11 days now & all a sudden on Labor Day it says out for delivery which is bull, no one delivers on Labor Day/ RARELY an if so not this apparent non trust worthy company. You guys are losing partnership & customers due to incompetence & neglect & theft! Google this shipping company everyone. I have $200 invested in the packages I\u2019m waiting on & have been waiting on since August 20th but purchased Aug. 14th my packages have been in their warehouse since August 21st. It\u2019s literally a scam this company. I believe TEMU & other large companies are dealing with this company trying to cut costs & are cutting the wrong costs. Future business will be impacted through regular faithful customers & companies of these companies! Who\u2019s items get shipped with piggyship/express with no say or choice in the matter. I\u2019ve never had an issue with DHL, UPS or USPS then this company comes along with nothing but complaints and my packages MIA. I took a loan out for my items I ordered through TEMU. I need my packageS! It\u2019s been since August 14th when I made my purchase. TEMU & others, STOP dealing with this scam of a company Piggyship. Your going to lose many customers & partnerships! If this issue is not resolved today or tomorrow, I will be calling the better business bureau on TEMU For continuing to use this last mile shipping company AND THIS particular shipping company PIGGYSHIP/PIGGYEXPRESS for scamming, incompetence & neglect! However, if I by some miracle happen to receive my packages, I will come back and edit this review, better yet & I\u2019ll write another review if allowed piggybacking off of this review for my doubt & misjudgment if that\u2019s even the case! Based off what I\u2019ve read online, I do not have confidence in receiving my packages through this company unless I happen to receive them I will never have confidence and knowing my items are safe!EDIT- I apologize, my fault! I should have waited, at least the day out because like I said, it did say it was out for delivery today/Lavor Day & moments after leaving this review, of course my package was delivered successfully! However, there is part of my package that is still yet to be delivered which I really hope it makes it to me safely. I had 11 items in my package today. Everything was accounted for nothing was missing. Nothing was damaged. I am waiting on one last package with three items. I will edit this again once that arrives. This may be a last mile shipping company, but the two drivers were very nice & respectful. Also there have been complications with my address before, we have issues with food delivery and other deliveries because my mailbox doesn't point to the street my address says. It's actually on the street beside me, it's complicated but I figured it was them and flagged them down. I confirmed my information and got my package. Luckily I was paying attention tho and looking out because I'm already aware of the complications we have from time to time & complications with my address from the past, but yes, at this moment my choices of  calling the BBB is put on hold because I had no issues with PiggyShip yet, I'm still waiting on one more package though. I will edit this review once I receive it and here is proof that I received my package today. Kudos to the company for delivering on Labor Day as well.",

I than asked to speak with a supervisor and was told NO supervisor here bye.. Like Really! Very unprofessional. I will be reporting them to BBB Expeditiously...",

The photo posted on their site [PiggyShip's]  on where they claim they delivered the product is a totally different address than mine. So I went to that address and there was no delivery. I suspect their driver is stealing the packages. I have filed a police report, but what's really frustrating is you cannot get anyone on a call, it goes to a voice mail that is full and they hang up, Clearly the worse delivery service in USA.",

Once the package is ready, we will deliver it in the next two days, thanks a lot!.\" When I asked a simple follow-up question about what caused the delivery not to be made the day it was out for delivery and why I had to reach out to try and have it rescheduled the guy replied \"thanks for your enquiries, have a good day!\" and ended the chat.I don't understand how this company hopes to survive in the US market with this type of service.",

I pointed at the mailbox and said \"NO!\" again and again, then pointed at my gate and made gestures on where to leave it. So, he comes back a week later and puts it in my mailbox AGAIN! I sent an email to Piggyship, and they replied a day or so later with this boilerplate response: \"Dear customer, we have received your message, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience. We will ensure to enforce strict standards for our drivers. Thank you, and we wish you a pleasant day!\"The same message was sent to me both times.

If you wish to try it for yourself the phone number is (800)  690-2256.  Next time I order from Temu and they ship with Piggyship I will cancel the order before it leaves the warehouse.

I was still working as a shopper last week and thought nothing of it.I'd understand if customers give big complaints regarding being late for few minutes at a time. Shipt doesn't understand the pain that shoppers consistently get with add on orders for some customers and using lots of time for the long winded communication with the customers. The weak Wifi In the stores delay the process even further. And to spend more than 15-30 minutes time to try and find the customers apartment in many huge complexes is very nerve wracking for trying to be on time. Not to say many customers don't answer their calls and leave me hanging for minutes and have delayed me to be on time. The added steps to make sure it's delivered also takes time when there's no network reception in majority of apartment complexes. I wish SHIPT's \"on time\" standards can be more lenient for shoppers. We work hard to satisfy the customers needs but overall it's the company who decides who they choose to let go. I had good ratings of overall 4.86. I often go above and beyond looking for items not on the shelves. To substitute items also takes extra time. This feels like a slap on my face for working hard for this company and customers. I love the opportunity to serve others but this type of corporate decision is sucks",

There were so many more problems with the order that I think the person who did the shopping had no clue about what they were doing.If you rate the shopper 1 or 2 you won't get them again (maybe).",

First, everything is around 5% more expensive on Shipt (they even admit so in help.shipt dot com /pricing/how-are-your-prices-determined ) -- so why do they charge shipping & handling on top? Scammy.On top of that, free shipping only applies above $35, which means that you'll probably pay the same or less ordering directly from the source even with a delivery fee (esp. if small).On top of that, you don't find the same products or ofers on the Shipt platform! E.g. CVS and Walgreens have great discounts for vitamins but those never come up in Shipt.I made several test runs on different stores and it's consistently more expensive on Shipt.Who comes up with these \"business models\" ? \"I know, let's become a middleman and have people pay MORE to order in a more complicated way!\" Do they think that we are dumb?",

Tips are the only way to make money. Shops start at $4 and up. Tips is where you make a living. Another downside is their help line has some who help but mainly copy and paste of what you learned in the lessons. So if you have a question or problem check the Hub. They will also deactivate you for no reason and claim a reason in the contract but not be specific. Don\u2019t get comfortable with 100 Preferred members and all 5 stars and they will drop you while delivering. They don\u2019t care for their customers or their shoppers they just care about the money and if you are making 900- $1000 working 20 hours they will deactivate you with no legitimate reason and if you try to find out you will just get the run around and a bunch of copy and paste from customer service. I would beware and not get too comfortable. They rather shoppers who deliver melted food 3 hours later than shoppers who take the gig seriously",

Second order was scheduled for the next day because they couldn\u2019t find a shopper. No apology. When I called customer care, she kept on going on and on how short they were of drivers I explained that was not my problem and she continued to tell me that they had a shopper but she bailed on my order. I\u2019m not sure why I would order something to be delivered tonight if I wanted it tomorrow. I asked the agent if she needed diapers for her baby, would she be happy if I told her she wasn\u2019t getting them till tomorrow. She didn\u2019t understand my point. No apology. Like it was my fault for placing  the order tonight. I told her I was going to cancel my Shipt membership because I don\u2019t want to pay h do or a service that delivers my groceries on THEIR schedule. Isn\u2019t the whole purpose of delivery having the customer get them Jen they want them?",

        "review_content": "Using the Shipt site means you pay a membership fee either monthly, semi-annually or annually. My issue is even though we are paying these fees for access to Shipt, they are actually gouging prices. I found out that shoppers aren't suppose to give receipts to clients. I found out why. The prices in the store are considerably lower than the price given for the same item on the Shipt site...anywhere from $.50 and higher. My issue is  we're already paying and annual fee. Why the need to gouge the prices to get even more money? It's definitely NOT going to the shoppers. I am a senior on a fixed income, so paying extra for items that are originally priced less is disconcerting to say the least. I cancelled my membership after being made aware of this.",

It was to be deliver to my husband\u2019s work before 5 PM & it was to be signed for. They arrived 2 hours late & threw it in the bush took a picture & sent text & told us to come get it. A $500 iPad. You\u2019re kidding right? There was someone who was still there so my husband asked him to get it but it was already stolen. We called Best Buy customer support but got nowhere but was sent in circles & then they were closed so we called the store but they weren\u2019t taking calls so we were sent to a call centre in India who couldn\u2019t do anything. I know this is about Shipt but Best Buy had them deliver it.",

It's cold, otherwise road conditions here are generally good. If this an example of SHIPT's routine operational efficiency, the company needs to clean up its act.SEQUELWe called four hours after the shipment's promised arrival only to learn it would be arrival this morning. Again, we had to pursue the update-neither SHIPT nor TARGET initiated an update. From the start, we made it clear we simply wanted to be updated. It was not to be without our persistence.At this writing, we are about four hours from the earlier projected arrival of the items.",

(As last time I had a lost product it was also sold out and you know how long it takes from china. )  Well by some miracle, two days later on Sunday morning - the package was really delivered.",

Business hours are super reasonable. SpeedX has attempted to deliver my package after business hours or before! Even after notifying them the hours of operation. I don\u2019t understand why a package is out for delivery at 5:30 AM in the morning and doesn\u2019t get attempted to be delivered until 11pm at night. Makes no sense! 2nd time 11pm, 3rd time 8am, 4th time is still out for jury today. But extremely dissatisfied. I\u2019ve reached out to Speedx several times reiterating the business hours. SMH!",

I received my package on time, the location of the package was perfect and the driver took 3 pictures as proof of delivery.

Just happened to be apart of my process in getting my business legitimized. Across the board, each person I spoke with had so much patience, understanding, appreciation, and courtesy for me. This is my first go around starting a non profit and I must say the process can be very intimidating but this team's people are truly created for helping people. The slowly walked me through, encouraged me to ask questions and even when i was double charged for fees, they were MORE than willing to help me to get everything corrected! As I said, this is my first time doing this so I cant compare to any other companies providing the same services but SWYFT FILINGS set the bar for me! I will choose them for every business endeavor!

        "review_content": "Not normally one to write reviews, but will do so here as this was just an instance of abnormally high quality customer service. Story goes: Called in about a secretary of state compliance issue that was brought to my attention from one of our vendors. Upon calling, was transferred within ~60 seconds to an actual person rather than a machine. Got ahold of Jodin, who was absolutely fantastic. Basically right off the bat, they were well aware of the compliance requirements, were able to assist me with figuring out where the hiccup occurred, proposed what would have likely caused the issue (which I confirmed was spot on following the call!), confirmed that we were in good standing in regards to the issue, then gave a quick rundown on the processes they undertake to avoid any hiccups on our companies end.All of this happened in about 6 or 7 minutes from dialing the number to ending the call. I don't think I've ever had a customer service interaction that was resolved so thoroughly, let alone one in such a short period of time. Props to swyft filings on this one, an issue I thought I'd be working on solving throughout an afternoon took less time than making coffee.",

I texted them and they sent a grainy picture of part of my building's outside not even the door and certainly not the interior vestibule.

Then after they apologised I went back into the chat and all their chat communications had disappeared except to say they took full responsibility but it was the merchants responsibility to provide a refund. Either the driver was incompetent or dishonest, and the person responding to my chats (of which I had already forwarded on to Cook Unity) deleted their texts so it seems dishonest to me. Also, the photo of the delivery disappeared too. It all seems very shady to me and I plan to cancel Cook Unity deliveries because of the issues.",

After reading all the reviews on Trustpilot, I really don\u2019t need to say anything more  because everything has been said. I don\u2019t know why any company would use them at all.  they are absolutely horrific. I have gotten more refunds from my food delivery company for orders that I didn\u2019t receive or that were delivered to the wrong address or delivered so late that the food was spoiled. There has to be another viable option.",

Even after customer support said that the driver made a mistake, they proceeded to not do anything about the mistake. Essentially saying it is out of our control when they\u2019re the ones that made the mistake and are refusing to correct it. All major store companies, specifically Zara, do NOT use this service for deliveries. What kind of delivery driver thinks a mechanical room is a place to deliver a package. Unacceptable.",

Their drivers don\u2019t speak any English here in the Austin area, which means if they call with trouble if you don\u2019t speak Spanish you\u2019re out of luck.  They are lazy, and when they don\u2019t feel like working anymore they just return all the rest of the deliveries to the warehouse.  Their customer service people told me that directly, it\u2019s not an assumption on my part.  I was going to cancel HomeChef, until they told me Veho only delivers Mondays and Tuesdays, so I moved to Wednesday and now FedEx is delivering in the future.  If Veho is the only shipping option anywhere you shop, I\u2019d go elsewhere.",

The front and back door are always open for deliveries and have concierge. But the lazy bum wants to take the one side door that is closed. There\u2019s like 10000 doors there. You can at least talk your lazy ass to the front or back door where it\u2019s for people to go in and out of. Couldn\u2019t believe the lazy bum would lie to me like my building is preventing people from coming in. Got UPS, FedEx, USPS, door dash, uber eats\u2026been at the apartment over a year ain\u2019t never had an issue with any of them until a lazy Veho bum employee does it \ud83d\ude02. Of course a lazy bum would pick a company that let its worker decide if he\u2019s too lazy to go to another door. Bum company and bum ass employees.

These last mile providers could not give a damn about your package. One buyer told me that Aramex made him go to their office to get his order if he wanted it. When the postage is so low, and fuel and other costs have risen, it makes you wonder how much motivation they have. Best to use a service that employs the national postal service.",

FOUR to FIVE WEEKS for a small package to Australia is very poor service. Unfortunately I've had this issue multiple times as the Online Store I deal with use Apc.

This package is a donation to help fundraise at Given To Live. Post pandemic funds are at a premium so this delay (or has it been stolen by a member of staff, hence avoiding communication?) is keenly felt.Absolute disgrace. Original - Absolutely shocking customer service\u2026to be exact zero. No tracking update & shipped on 20th May. Perspective - package of same size shipped from US to us in UK arrived with tracking all the way within 6days.I\u2019ve tweeted. No response.Emailed twice. No response.And I notice here that Apc only respond when they can pass the buck. Appalling.",

Suffice to say, I'm switching back to Canada Post because even without tracking, at least they export the packages out of the country quickly. I've had multiple overseas packages sit in APC's US warehouse for weeks without moving. I had an order delivered to the completely wrong address on the other side of town, I know this because the delivery person added GPS delivery location of the WRONG ADDRESS. This company is beyond incompetent, and I advise any small business to not use them, however appealing their prices and delivery times might be.",

Only option is to leave a message because selecting the option to speak to an operator sends you back to leaving a message. It's an 0845 number, so the call is at my expense. Had no response after leaving a message. If someone from Asendia is reading this, please reach out to try and resolve.Update #2: Had an e-mail reply, but was told the matter was for the UK delivery partner. Yet the UK delivery partner tell me it is a matter for the sending postal authority. I am stuck, and my parcel is going round in circles, and looks likely to be exported back out of the UK a second time.Update #3: Parcel returned to sender because according to the UK delivery partner the CP72 address label and the CN22 customs declarations were missing",

There is no option to submit a complaint, though even if there was it would probably be another form they choose to ignore.

The parcel was shipped and received (not just \"information received\", actual acceptance of the parcel) by Asendia on September 26.

The vendor had to reach out to Asendia, who did not respond to her, but suddenly the parcel left Sweden (again?) and took three further days to make it to Ireland and be handed over to the Irish post. I could have walked the parcel to Ireland from Finland in the time it took Asendia to ship the \"express\" parcel. Bad form, Asendia. I guess we'll see whether the parcel has been tampered with when it arrives tomorrow.Edit: In response to the offer of contact below - I contacted your customer service on the day of the original review and was promised a response that has yet to be given.

        "review_content": "Ich bin eigentlich nie jemand gewesen, der Bewertungen schreibt. Aber ich habe auch noch nie mit einer derart inkompetenten Firma zu tun gehabt! Ich habe bei Temu etwas aus China bestellt, alles bezahlt, und laut E-Mail ist von deren Seite aus alles gut gelaufen. Nun ja, auf einmal bekomme ich am 21.10.2024 eine Mail von Temu: \"Herzlichen Gl\u00fcckwunsch, Ihre Bestellung ist in der Schweiz. Klicken Sie auf Tracking, um sie zu verfolgen.\" Gesagt, getan! Als ich das tat, landete ich auf einer Website von Asendia. Dort steht bei der Bestellinfo: \"Retourniert \u2013 nicht abgeholte Sendung.\" Aber es war immer noch der gleiche Tag, der 21.10.2024!Diese reudige, inkompetente Drecksfirma hat mir weder eine Info gegeben, dass ich etwas abholen sollte, noch sonst irgendetwas! Au\u00dferdem, wof\u00fcr bestellt man nach Hause, wenn dann so eine rotzfreche Firma daherkommt und verlangt, dass man seine bezahlte Ware abholt! Die haben doch nicht mehr alle Tassen im Schrank... Fazit: Jetzt habe ich einen halben Monat auf bezahlte Ware gewartet \u2013 f\u00fcr nichts! Die Produkte wurden um die halbe Welt geschickt, und das nur wegen so einem nutzlosen Betrieb wie Asendia!Au\u00dferdem kann man diese Firma weder \u00fcber die 0800-Nummer, die nicht funktioniert, noch per E-Mail kontaktieren. Laut anderen Bewertungen erh\u00e4lt man auf E-Mails keine Antwort. Ich habe trotzdem eine geschrieben. Aber warum, zum Teufel, gibt man eine Kontakt-Nummer an, die nicht funktioniert? Das sagt doch schon alles \u00fcber diese Firma aus!I\u2019ve never really been the kind of person who writes reviews. But I\u2019ve also never dealt with such an incompetent company before! I ordered something from China through Temu, paid for everything, and according to an email from them, everything went smoothly. Well, suddenly on 21.10.2024, I receive an email from Temu: \"Congratulations, your order is in Switzerland. Click on tracking to follow it.\" Said and done! When I did that, I ended up on a website from Asendia. There, the order info said: \"Returned \u2013 unclaimed shipment.\" But it was still the same day, 21.10.2024!This lousy, incompetent company didn\u2019t even give me any information that I needed to pick something up \u2013 nothing! Also, why would you order something to your home if some pathetic company like this comes around and expects you to pick up your paid goods! They must be out of their minds\u2026 In conclusion, I waited half a month for paid goods \u2013 for nothing! The products were shipped halfway around the world, all for nothing because of a useless company like Asendia!Furthermore, you can't contact this company either through the 0800 number, which doesn\u2019t work, or by email. According to other reviews, they don\u2019t respond to emails. I wrote one anyway. But why on earth would they provide a contact number that doesn\u2019t work? That alone says everything about this company!",

        "review_content": "I'm amazed that FlashBox has such a high rating. Whenever I am forced to use this company my tracking number magically disappears\u2014every time. As I do every time, I reached out to support who gave me the same response as the last 2 times- the seller didn't send the package to them. Contact the seller. Odd because I watched the package arrive at their sorting facility when my tracking number was functional. The last 2 times they delivered my package after telling me this generic response. Terrible customer service and that isn't to throw the agents under the bus. I don't believe they are equipped to be great by Flashbox.",

She even sad bye and waved as she walked away. Excellent service!",

I called right away to figure out what what was happening. They told me that the driver was here for 20 minutes and called me. I didn\u2019t get any call from this driver. What scumminess.

My initials MP it\u2019s not that hard to put an M in a P but the delivery person put a random thing and told the company because I made a complaint about it that I did sign for it which is not true.The company has proof that I did not sign for it because the initials is not what I would put and the guy didn\u2019t even take a proper photo. Clearly he never dropped off any merchandise. He just took pictures far away and that was it. That\u2019s why they\u2019re blurry. I have surveillance cameras he doesn\u2019t even pick up on my front door camera because he was never there that close.When I told the company well obviously, he\u2019s lying because it would make me look bad if he knew what my hair colour was which is pretty rememberable, because he said he passed the package to me, never happened and they didn\u2019t even ask him that they believe the driver who forge my signature, which is against the law!I would not recommend this company at all to anyone! Liars, scammers the drivers are not reliable and they forge your signature and take your package.",

It went from Vegas to Ontario Canada on 9/6.....a little out of the way to get to Texas! It was supposed to arrive by 9/12. It hasn't moved since 9/6 and is still in Canada. I did live chat with GLS and explained the issue. The customer service rep simply said \"you will have to wait for dispatch to update. Please bare with us! Anything else?\" While typing a response it says \"this chat will now end\" and they were gone. Thanks for all your help GLS!!

We learned three years ago never to use GLS after they consistently failed to deliver goods to us in rural Sicily, claiming they couldn\u2019t find the address or had come but we weren\u2019t in, despite our staying home all day and sometimes several days waiting in vain for the to arrive. But, we can\u2019t always convince other companies that are sending us stuff not to use them and we\u2019ve just had the same experience three years\u2019 on, so they clearly haven\u2019t learned. This time, rather than wait days in vain getting increasingly angry,  I shot down to their regional hub in Siracusa & collected our package myself. Their excuse for not delivering it was that they didn\u2019t have enough information to find our house despite having our full address, phone number and a dropped pin. This company is owned by Britain\u2019s Royal Mail? Is Her Majesty The Queen aware of the royal seal being used by these sharks?",

At no point during the four day period where they claimed to attempt to deliver my package, did I receive a phone call of any kind. I work from home so I am always home. I just don't leave. Yet each day the driver said I was not home. They just flat out lied each day and didn't attempt delivery. The building concierge even verified that GLS had not entered the building.Now, apparently my package is on the way back to the shipper. I called their customer service and they told me in the most rude fashion possible to go complain to the shipper. This is the most unprofessional company I have ever had the displeasure to deal with.",

Absurd. And let\u2019s not start with the with their \u201creal-time updates\u201d. I\u2019ve never in my life seen a delivery company using different domains to update a package! One domain says that the package is stuck in their depot, another one says it\u2019s delivering and another one hasn\u2019t updated since it left!

I have been in contact with them each week once noon hits and I don\u2019t have the package like I normally do to tell them it has to be delivered before 5 pm, once they managed to call and said will be there by five every other time it\u2019s a crapshoot and it either gets delivered the next day or it doesn\u2019t get delivered on time and it gets delivered after hours to a locked business and stolen.  This is a trash, logistics company.",

Most recent experience: item shipped 24 July was received in Secaucus, NJ on 27 July...and has now been there for over a month. OSM denies they have it, claims Secaucus is NOT a facility, but just \"a zip code.\" Status shows \"Picked up by shipping partner\"; guess who \"shipping partner\" is: OSM Worldwide. Two Customer non-Service reps say \" Picked up\" doesn't really mean what the entire English-speaking world thinks it means...turns out it means \"logged into the system\". Who knew?

To be fair, we are still inside the original guesstimate time of arrival. I was in no big hurry to receive this package (a book). Part of the reason I purchased from the eBay vendor was it was so cheap with shipping included. I am guessing OSM rents the book out for a few days to subsidize their costs.",

I would understand if the package had to cross borders and border patrol and customs however, it did not need to cross any of those as the route was all US states.Never order from anysite that uses OSM such as dbrand",

Ask for a manager as this is continuous problems almost with every shipment. No manager called me. I am canceling the account as it\u2019s is just not worth the follow up on packages.",

Being a sole operator I'm stuck at my office all day till he turns up -- that is, IF he turns up. A simple response to my text would be fine, but no, he simply can't be bothered to tell me he's not coming. There goes another day that I'm held captive at my premises. It's extremely frustrating.",

This is unaccepatable and over time what we found out is that they hide this information because they rarely provide any refunds.

I was also put on a NO SENDLE list.. I love they exist so you can get other couriers to deliver instead.WHAT is scaring the Sh@t out of me now... I just ordered a guitar... paid the delivery..Australia Post was suppost to be the handler.. instead I got a message saying SENDLE are delivering it to me from Melbourne to South AustraliaGOD HELP ME, THEN.. the supplier said make sure you check the guitar when it arrives before you sign it as once you do the courier no longer have responsibility for the item.This company is Sh!t in every way",

These guys do not have their own couries/drivers, they pick up your possessions and then find the cheapest nastiest couriers to deliver them.. if they ever deliver that is! Pay a few dollars more and use a reputable courier service,  you wont regret it, I wish I did!If you dont believe me, try them, disappointment is guaranteed.

        "review_content": "Finding a trustworthy and reliable fulfilment warehouse is such an important decision for a product based business. They are one of our biggest outgoings on the balance sheet and if fulfilment goes wrong it can be really damaging. So we are so grateful to Sprint Logistics for their constant professionalism and dedication. We had a previous bad experience with another warehouse, so were feeling like we had our fingers burned, but what a breath of fresh air they have been! Every single person within the team, from the warehouse to our account manager to the founders have given us 5 star service, and always go above and beyond for us and our customers. Long may it continue!",

        "review_content": "This review is aimed at the management of Sprint Logistics Peterborough and should not reflect negatively on the hardworking team members who are just following instructions.Our four years of loyalty as customers with Sprint Logistics turned out to be deeply disappointing. Initially, they projected trustworthiness and customer-oriented service, but over time, deceptive practices came to light. The company seemed focused on squeezing more money out of unsuspecting clients, which eroded trust and fairness in their business dealings.One concerning aspect is their tendency to inflate the number of pallet fees per week, seemingly driven solely by profit-seeking motives. Additionally, charging the same pick and handling fee for both regular B2B orders and the collection of \"expired\" products destined for destruction, lacked transparency and fairness.When I tried to terminate our collaboration, they insisted I was still under contract from four years ago, forcing me to give a three-month notice period. This tactic appeared to extend our collaboration and cost me an additional \u00a3255 in Managing Account fees.Furthermore, they billed us weekly pallet fees for three months, even after the stock in question had been removed. This demonstrated their financial desperation and willingness to resort to any means possible to gain more money.Potential clients should exercise extreme vigilance when dealing with Sprint Logistics. Scrutinize billing statements, challenge dubious charges, and be cautious of hidden contract terms.Let this review serve as a stark reminder to remain vigilant and protect yourself from unscrupulous practices.\"",

It's great reading here people call them out though and then them claiming they can't find them in their records. I won't be answering any text or calls from this company what so ever. It's clear they are scamers trying to scare people into debt that's usually not actually theird in the first place. If anyone wants to take this further then again I have physical copies of all my bills iv paid so go for it.",

Resign today. You should sleep better at night working almost anywhere else.If you were thinking of working here \u2013\u00a0DON'T.

        "review_content": "I made a terrible decision in the past, a decision to use 1&1 for some web hosting. We all start projects that we eventually lose interest in and forget about. Almost every web hosting company on the planet wants you to set up a recurring subscription, usually using a debit card. If your debit card expires or is cancelled, you web hosting won't be renewed.Not with 1&1. 1&1 will still keep your contracts going with them for as long as they can (forever even) if you don't cancel them. Even if they have no payment details from you. That's where Arvato come in. They use Arvato to try and scare you into paying for services that you don't actually have to pay for. Infact, I actually had contact from 1&1 live chat which said I was under no legal obligation to pay for the web-hosting that was renewed by them, but not used.That does not stop Arvato from harrassing me. Calling me with robotic voices, texting me sometimes twice a day. A few letters also. I have more than enough money to pay Arvato, but they won't see a penny of it. It's not even a big amount. I was actually gullible and stupid enough to pay Arvato for my 1&1 contract that was automatically renewed in the past, thinking that was the end of it. However 1&1 still kept renewing it even though I believed it was finally cancelled. I couldn't even have access to my 1&1 account anymore as they deleted it.Arvato who are in partnership with 1&1 are extorting people. It's likely illegal and I'm assuming authorities will be investigating it. If not now then in the future.Obviously, you will always expect these types of companies to have very low ratings online. Nobody likes a debt collection agency. However these are the most immoral and questionable ones I've been the target of and I'd advise anybody being harrassed by them to NOT PAY A PENNY.",

First things first: the dashboard is very similar to Amazons website (Seller Central), so it will not take a lot of time to learn how to use it. It is not overcomplicated, which really is a big plus considering that we are people that do not have a lot of time.You will also get an onboarding that really pays off. The onboarding team is great, they will support your journey with everything they have, questions get answered pretty fast and you really have somebody you can count on. Last but not least the fulfillment itself. The costs are lower than for example amazons. You have the option to provide your own packaging material. Branding is also possible when having byrd as a partner. For me personally the byrd option to change your parcel services daily and always using the one with the lowest cost, is the best experience.All in all I really enjoy byrd as a business partner. Everything simply gets done, works out and just does exactly what it has to do.(I am from Germany, please have mercy if there is any comma missing)",

Marc supported us in every way beyond his actual scope of duties and was the main reason for our positive experience. At this point once again: Thank you Marc!!!When all processes are set up correctly, fulfillment through Byrd works really well and very quickly. However, the communication channels after the onboarding process (and before the offboarding process) are quite complex and lengthy, making quick responses to issues much more difficult. However, these are due to the overall structure of the Byrd system and not the employees. In any case, the team has been very helpful and accommodating.Therefore 7/5 stars for the team and a few deductions for everything else.",

They made a concerted effort to understand our situation and work towards a mutually agreeable resolution. This level of service is a hallmark of a great company. I strongly recommend Byrd for their reliability, excellent service, and hands-on team.",

The Byrd portal is user-friendly and well-organized, making it easy to navigate and manage orders. Additionally, our onboarding manager  Marc has always been super friendly and eager to help, which we greatly appreciate.However, there are several areas where Byrd needs improvement. There is often a lack of communication within the team, leading to situations where one person doesn't know what the other is doing. We've encountered several instances where invoices were incorrect, and costs were charged for services that weren't agreed upon. There have also been a few mistakes in the fulfillment process that differed from what was discussed. The internal communication seems slow and inefficient, and there have been times when it felt like we were the first clients of Byrd because simple queries about processes and integrations couldn't be answered.Overall, there's significant room for improvement. We hope to see smoother operations in the future. Many thanks again to our onboarding manager Marc, who was always at our side with his full commitment.",

Onboarding & offboarding went very well with a single point of contact.After onboarding, the nightmare started with the technical support. Extremely slow answer (multiple days to weeks) and sometimes simply no more answer. You need to open a new ticket to remind them to answer.They didn't respect the contract we signed with multiple issues (incorrect carrier, incorrect weight, incorrect charges...). Also not respecting the shipping time frame (all orders before 12:00 will be shipped same day, is simply a false statement). We didn't have an account manager despite the fact we asked multiple times. They ignore. We also asked multiple times a meeting, ignored as well.Finally be aware that BYRD doesn't own anything. They don't own the warehouses and they don't own their shipping label system. They use a third party company - SENDCLOUD. So everytime there is an issue it's either the warehouse or sendcloud and this is why it takes ages to answer or solve the issue.They simply don't care to solve the root cause of their issues. They only try to fix the current problem but it will ultimately repeat again.We stayed there 2 months and left before our trial ends. Thanks god!",

We track our team working hours and we spent 2.3x times what we spent with Kubbo.We needed to leave and the offboarding process was a nightmare. They didn\u00b4t send it all together, requested for picking charge when the material arrived just as we sent it.Seriously, just don\u00b4t do it. This happened in our lowest time when we had 50 orders a month. If it had happened in our highest months with 1000 orders we wouldn\u00b4t have been able to follow up with the problems there were and would have lost so mnay clients in the process.CONCLUSION: It\u00b4s not worthy to put your business in risk, trust us.",

It is evident that she and the team at byrd genuinely care about their clients and go above and beyond to provide top-notch service.Beyond being a mere service provider, byrd has proven to be a true business partner.

        "review_content": "We were customers for 2 years had a terrible experience with Byrd. During the off-boarding process, they lost our stock. They refused to provide  provide a packing list, and provided no other proof of what products were sent in the off boarding. Despite their mistake, they refused to take any liability for the lost items (about 900 products to be exact). Even though some of the representatives have been really nice and helpful, it's clear that their service is ineffective and unprofessional from the management team. The fact that they don't own their warehouses means they have no control over what happens to their customers' inventory. We would never recommend working with them to anyone, and strongly advise others to avoid doing business with this company.Update 31st March 2023The last communication we recieved from Byrd was 3rd March 2023, stating that Byrd is rejecting liability. If your stakeholders are truly looking into finding a solution, then we have not been informed. In response to your sentence ''Logistics can be a mess sometimes.'' - Yes this is true, but it's not the response you expect to hear from your 3PL when they lose your stock.",

        "review_content": "We wish we never engaged with Huboo. We have been let down over and over. Latest issue is their b2b service. Over 50% of our orders have either been lost or damaged in transit or have been delivered to the wrong address. But worst of all, Huboo have refused to follow up on orders where Fedex staff have opened our packages, stolen products, repackaged poorly so they arrive damaged even when we have supplied photo evidence. Huboo simply say they did their part and refuse to follow up with Fedex. We are not able to follow up directly with Fedex as it is the Huboo account. Huboo also do not offer protection or cover for b2b orders so we just need to accept the significant financial impact and disgruntled customers, which are hurting us as a small growing business.I wish this was the first issue we had with Huboo but it is not. From being miss-sold in the sales process to changing prices that make the storage costs ridiculous compared to other 3PLs... I have had their head of customer service contact me to discuss ways they can improve which I really appreciated and then stayed with them in the hope they would change... but then when more issues arise, they hide behind the customer service team who inform me I can no longer contact them.",

Check the Google reviews for a fair representation of their business. There also seemed to be a lot of incorrect orders, and our stock numbers on Shopify were frequently off despite updating this regularly. The final straw was a minimum price cap of \u00a3650 with less than a months notice, something that came completely out the blue and had the potential to massively harm our business going into the busiest time of year.

We are small to medium e-commerce company, selling D2C and B2B to retailers.Shipbob has great software which is slick and easy to use but beyond that the service they deliver is a joke. Their fulfilment centres are not owner or operated by Shipbob meaning everything becomes a huge cumbersome, slow issue. Their pricing & billing is purposely unclear, vague and borderline deceiving. If you need support or a quick question, forget it. No-one ever online on the live chat, no-one answers the phone, email support takes over 24 hours to get back to you. I won't detail our full horrid experience as it's not worth the time but simply put, if you are considering Shipbob, I can't strongly enough recommend that you look elsewhere & avoid this company.",

Finally, building off that previous point, hopefully we'll be able to get lower TFC shipping rates in the future.

Sorry about that, all fixed!\" Not even an attempt at any remediation, and then another 3 weeks go by and the SAME THING HAPPENS. Somehow they managed to put in the system that it was sending from the wrong location TWICE. It has now been over 9 weeks since I placed my order. Not only has it not even shipped yet, I can't even get a response regarding what's going on at this point or whether I have a new tracking link since my last two both just say \"Order Canceled.\" How on earth can a company be allowed to run this way? The only reason I even want my couch anymore at this point is so this awful experience can finally be over. I don't care how much of a discount you think you're getting on some name-brand furniture, just buy it directly from the actual company. I promise the hassle and headache you'll experience from this operation is not worth a few hundred dollars in savings. I don't think I'd want to put up with this anymore if they tried to give me my order for free.EDIT: After 10 weeks, they lost my order. All that time wasted. Absolute garbage company.",

I contacted customer service, who appear to be short-handed. They were still quite helpful, and after a couple weeks found the legs and hardware that were missing. Those arrived, and now I have two great couches for MUCH less than retail! So in summary: It took a long time and there was a shipping hiccup, but if you are patient, it is well worth it.",

Evidently it had already shipped but the system failed to update me. The delivery window was 4-6 weeks so was incredibly surprised to have them schedule a delivery with me for December 12. (For scale, I live in Chicago and the warehouse was located in NJ)No problems with the delivery, the couch was missing a charging piece which FloorFound promptly sent a replacement for.

My order came from the Perth Amboy, NJ warehouse and I received my order within about 2 weeks of purchase (delivered to California). Delivery and communications from the fulfillment company were prompt, clear, and accurate, and my couch was exactly as described (like new condition). I also received very prompt and friendly responses from Floor Found customer service when I had a question about billing, so I was pleased with that element as well.I don't doubt that others had bad experiences, but with my experience being as good as it was it sounds like Floor Found has major inconsistencies between warehouses, fulfillment/shipping companies, and quality control for inspection of items. For what it's worth, I'm really happy with my order!",

        "review_content": "While there may be some deals, my experience left me feeling that not everything is as it seems.I was interested in a rug that was $4,500 marked down to $875 by a brand called 'French Coastal'. I wanted to read some reviews and understand the quality and the process that made this rug more expensive that some designer rugs I had seen.I'm already familiar with other brands on their website such as Burrow, Castelry and assumed this company must be similar.After googling French Coastal I realised that this \"brand\" only exists on their website. There's zero trace of it online.After speaking with Sasheika on their chat function they confirmed that French Coastal is in fact their OWN brand.When I enquired further about what made this rug, a rug by their own brand, a whopping $4,500 to begin with, the reply was that \"pricing was not their department\", with no offer to put me through to someone whos department it is.Since Floorfound deals in recommerce I asked if they might have a link to this rug at it's Full Price so that I might try to understand where the $4,500 price tag came from and was told that they are only authorized to talk about items on their website.Since this is their own brand, I found it strange that they could not give me any further information on this item. After much back and forth and talking around my line of enquiry I very much began to feel that this rug probably has never been $4,500, it's probably never been sold anywhere at $4,500 and it made me doubt that $875 is even a good deal for it.I felt that the \"deal\" was perhaps misrepresented and decided not to purchase on this occasion. If I were to purchase it would be from one of the brands that actually exist so that I could verify quality and fair pricing.",

I was hoping for great things and rooting for them. I love their company mission and was hoping the reviews were from grouchy people. I should have believed the reviews on this company. Even Outer said what an awful company they were when asked about buying through them. The first part of my order wasn\u2019t fully delivered. The second time to fix the first part, the wrong cushion was sent. I was told I could source my own replacement and when I told them the cost to replace the part from the original company, they refused to pay.  Instead, I was ordered an entire chair replacement that I would be in charge of recycling.  It defeats the purpose of their core mission. This could be an amazing company, but it is absolutely horrible. Christopher doesn\u2019t follow up and didn\u2019t offer anything for bri g outside of delivery schedule quotes of $499. Kat did follow up and tried to make things right before the second error was made. She tried, but the shipping companies and floorfound do not communicate with each other. Do not buy from this company until they figure out their quality control.",

I had two previous orders with FloorFound that went well, but after this experience I won't be using them again. The chairs I ordered are now on sale with the original retailer with free 3-5 day shipping and a lower price than FloorFound's. Order at your own risk and expect to stay on top of Metropolitan Warehouse via phone email and tracking links to make sure they actually bring you the items they paid for. You'd think paying $300 for shipping would actually get your items delivered, but apparently it's not. In the future I'd just wait for a sale from the original retailer.

I needed to place a large furniture order after having all of my belongings stolen by a moving company and figured it would be worth it to save some money by buying used, but my god, what a nightmare.1. The first item, a nightstand from Burrow, arrives still flat-packed in the box. Appears to have been a brand new item that someone just didn't like, but after taking out all of the pieces to being assembly, I find that I have two left sides instead of a left and right side, can't actually assemble the stand. I reach out to Floor Found about getting a replacement piece, but Burrow can't ship a single piece, so I literally have to toss this in the trash, though Floor Found does refund me the purchase price and shipping costs.2. I order three (3) pieces of sectional from Floyd. Though I order them at the same time, I get the ottoman right away but wait weeks for the other pieces, only to be told that first, the left side of the sectional is not in the condition as described and is (in their words) \"not suitable for sale\", so they find another one of similar quality that I eventually get a few weeks later. The right side somehow gets \"lost when they moved warehouses\", but they find me another one in similar condition. I wait a few more weeks only to be told that oops! They accidentally already sold this to someone, and their website didn't update in time. They have no other similar pieces, so I now have half a sectional.3. The dining table I ordered appears to have been handed off to Metro Delivery, but I keep getting told that it's not at the local hub and that they'll reach out to me when it is. Finally, a week after I check the tracking information and see that it has (allegedly) been sitting in their local warehouse, I call Metro only to find out that Floor Found canceled the \"ticket\" (whatever that means) and that they don't have this item, so queue reaching out to Floor Found AGAIN to figure out what's going on.4. I'm still waiting on a media console that has now taken almost three months to be shipped, after which, I don't think I'll ever order from Floor Found again, which is unfortunate, because it's a great idea, but it's just too inconsistent and poorly managed to be worth it.",

Or how they say their shipping timeframe can be used as an excuse that all your order didn't arrive together because it's lost???So if you happen to receive your order and take off work and parts are missing they aren't responsible. For reference this is a sectional and only 3 of the 5 parts were on the delivery truck! From FloorFound: following up with you on your order that was missing pieces. Since your order was placed on January 14, 2023, and we quote a delivery timeframe of 6-8 weeks, management is not granting permission to proceed with a full refund at this time.The next step will be to request a Dock Search to be performed at the warehouse so all 5 of the boxes containing the Harper Sectional may be located and delivered to you. This can take up to 7-10 business days to complete, but please rest assured, we will do our best to still get this to you within the quoted timeframe for delivery.BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!

The Rip off Rebound 'portal' gave me a royal mail drop off option of \u00a36.20 and an InPost locker drop off option of \u00a37.10. If you can pay \u00a33.39 as a consumer for a tracked and picked up service, just imagine how little they actually pay with bulk discounts. I had to phone NBA and request the return address so I could send it myself without being ripped off by Rebound. Yet another example of corporates exploiting the consumer for all they can get and no regulation to prevent them.",

I\u2019ve contacted ASOS who haven\u2019t received the order, and have told me they can\u2019t help me any further as they need a proof of return. When I try and check the tracking with ReBound it comes up with an error page. I\u2019m now \u00a3399 down.. top tip - if ASOS give you a returns label using ReBound refuse to use it!!!!

They took my money and refused to give me a full refund. As a beginner, I wanted to try their service to help with my business, but it has been a frustrating learning curve. After the trial ended, they automatically enrolled me in an expensive monthly subscription without my consent. I reached out to cancel and requested a refund, but they ignored my request and continued to charge me.

Crazy..I explained to them that I couldn\u2019t afford it, especially since I borrowed the money to cover important bills. Still, they only offered to refund $167 out of the nearly $500 they took from my bank account. It's disheartening because I trusted them, and now I\u2019m left in a tough situation. I hope others can avoid the same experience. I know they probably delete every negative comments. Guess what I been trying to talk to them they just egnore me for sure.. Sad..",

        "review_content": "Tldr: Do not use this company. They wasted 8 weeks of our time and money, lost our order, refused to take ownership, blamed everyone but themselves and used our phone number from our order [without our permission] to contact us about another customer\u2019s lost order that was sent to us instead of the correct destination. 2 stars because we received a refund and the samples were nice, but overall the experience was a nightmare and a huge waste of time and money. ------------Where to even start with the full story. I guess I will start with a positive because there is only one. The samples we ordered from Arka turned out beautiful. Mainly because of the design we created, but the print quality was also good so we will give them that. One important thing to note [something we didn\u2019t find out until our boxes were lost] is that Arka is just a nice website interface - they outsource everything. Despite taking 7 weeks to receive our 10 sample boxes & not receiving a tracking email until 3 days after our samples arrived (I will also mention that the \u201ctracking\u201d  email did not include an actual tracking number or link - we should have taken that as a sign), we decided to move forward with placing our full order.We placed our full order on January 4, 2021. On January 25th we received an email saying my order was preparing to ship & some questions to answer to coordinate delivery. We responded immediately & followed up a few days later asking for a tracking number at which time Arka responded saying providing a delivery date was not possible and once they had tracking information available they would provide it to us.On February 7th (10 business days after being originally contacted about our order being prepared to ship) we followed up again with Arka because they had still not provided a tracking number. Finally, after having to loop in the owner to our email, we received a tracking number on February 11. The tracking number stated our estimated delivery date was February 11 - the same day we received \u201ctracking\u201d but the link Arka provided had NO tracking history. So, we had no idea where our order actually was.We noticed a freight logo on my tracking so we reached out to that company directly. That company told us they handed over the shipment to another company so we called that company only to find out that due to a logistical error, our shipment had been placed on hold & had been sitting for TEN days. Something we could have looked into sooner if Arka had provided a tracking number, but instead we lost another 10 days.We contacted Arka again at which time they told us it was a weather/COVID delay, which we knew was a lie since we had email proof stating the logistical error from their vendor causing the shipment to be cancelled and ultimately put on hold.A million calls and emails later [with no help from Arka], we were finally able to release the hold on February 15 & received a new ETA of February 24-26 (TWENTY BUSINESS DAYS after our order allegedly shipped) . On February 22, after our tracking hadn\u2019t updated in TWENTY days and no one had contacted us to coordinate delivery we recontacted the freight company who told us our order was lost (after spending HOURS on the phone).We wasted EIGHT WEEKS, thousands of dollars on boxes, thousands of dollars on the delay of our launch of our business and thousands of dollars in rent/ingredients for our kitchen space because we were fooled by a pretty website interface and chose to work with Arka.The crazy part is this story doesn\u2019t even end with OUR lost boxes. On March 10th we received hundreds of someone else\u2019s boxes. Not wanting someone else to go through what we did, we personally reached out to the other company to tell them that we received their boxes. After them not hearing back from Arka, we personally contacted the printing facility Arka uses and coordinated a pick up for redelivery.THEN at 5:30pm on a Friday after we didn\u2019t respond to an email from Arka because we had already scheduled a pick up for their other customer, we got a text from Arka\u2019s owner blaming FedEx for the lost boxes. Not only do we find it completely inappropriate for him to use our phone number from our order to contact us without our permission, he still didn\u2019t accept responsibility for the lost order - he blamed FedEx. FedEx didn\u2019t lose the order, Arka did! The other company\u2019s order was delivered to exactly who it was addressed to\u2026 US.In full transparency, the owner contacted us again on March 18th (2.5 months after we placed our order & a month plus after losing our order) offering 50 free boxes and blog post to make it up to us. We declined his offer because it was too late to try and \u201cmake it up to us\u201d as we had already encountered too many losses because of Arka. We also did not feel comfortable with Arka promoting our business when we do not support theirs.",

Esiste una chat incompetente che ti rimanda a qualche agente che non richiama. Altrimenti ti devi infilare nel coacervo delle varie FAQ con risposte precostituite che non contemplano mai i reclami. Come fosse tutto rose e fiori e l'azienda immacolata. Questa \u00e8 un'azienda arrogante, ha un atteggiamento dispotico che forse si pu\u00f2 permettere solo in Italia. Non credo che in altri Paesi europei e mondiali e nemmeno in Spagna da dove proviene, gli sia permesso di esercitare questa arrogante posizione dominante in tutta tranquillit\u00e0. In conclusione: per sporgere un reclamo devi scrivere una raccomandata all Sede spagnola (spendendo 10 euro), i quali non ti rispondono dopo 1 mese. Pertanto Auctane si arroga il diritto di sbagliare e mandarti una fattura fasulla, per la quale non hai usufruito di un servizio, e poi non mette a disposizione degli utenti i mezzi per richiedere un rimborso. Questo \u00e8 un atteggiamento estorsivo.",

They will lead you on with constant promises of all the savings they will get you, but once you sign up you find out all the things needed to actually update your inventory programmatically all cost extra and that savings somehow involve you sending truck loads of inventory. They don't tell you everything has to be done manually through your side down to actually adding available inventory from their warehouse to sellercentral. Once we figured this out, they had our inventory and wanted us to pay $200,000 in monthly fees to buy out our contract that wasn't even a month old. We hadn't even sold $500 yet, and they held less than 10k in inventory. When we pointed out that they failed to meet even basic obligations for a company our size, that all fulfilment and even receiving cost were MORE than what we were already paying, they responded that they needed more time and that they met all responsibilities. Don't waste your time with this bait and switch company. There only concern is roping you in and milking you to get out.",

        "review_content": "In my 7 years of business, the \"partnership\" with Cahoot has been the worst business mistake of my career. Stay far away!They constantly made errors with shipping, i.e a simple 60 piece wholesale order took 2 months to ship when they promised 2-3 days, they also promised they'd be able to use customer supplied labels but then redacted it and we had customers constantly emailing us the wrong products were shipped or missing items. Finally the worst part is now we want to break away from this scam, move our 6k pcs of inventory, (less than 100 boxes), they're requiring we pay $22,000 USD. It's a 5 hour job to move inventory yet they are pigheaded we must pay that amount to release our property. They misguided fees in intro calls, saying removal fees are billed as a wholesale order, ($45 an hour) - however they have a hidden fee which they claim entitles them to a $2.99 removal cost + additional BS fees ontop of it.",

The potential for service disruption without recourse for mission-critical business operations is something that needs to be vetted up front.  The potential for miscommunication and immature software further exacerbates these issues making Cahoot.ai a high risk option for businesses without strong cash reserves and/or high margins.

They took care to analyze our business in detail before we onboarded so they were certain they could fulfill their promise of service and cost. The onboarding process was extremely easy. The Cahoot team did all the heavy lifting and the Cahoot platform is simple and easy to use. Working with Cahoot provides us with the flexibility to store product near our customers. The team continue to work with us to ensure we distribute our inventory to the right locations across the US to reduce our SPD label costs. Rather than buying an app or a service, it feels like we have begun a great partnership with the Cahoot team who have a genuine interest in helping our business to succeed.",

        "review_content": "Cahoot is a great company with a team of real innovators and a fantastic software. My review will be focused more on the software:The Cahoot software is very well thought out, with many unique features that set them apart from the competition. What was really a game changer for us is the fact that the software does rate shopping automatically and when we came in each morning to the office the labels were ready to be printed, saving us a tremendous amount of time and giving us the peace of mind that we are paying the lowest rates for our shipping. This enabled us to keep up with spikes in demand, such as when COVID-19 hit and Amazon FBA was backlogged for 2 months.I also love their built-in WMS tools, such as \"Scan to verify\" which essentially guarantees we are shipping the correct item every time!Finally, Cahoot has a customer support that really listens to the feedback of their users, and is constantly looking to improve their product. We started with them when the software was still pretty new, and they implemented many changes based on our feedback. This is not something to take for granted!",

They also set up a HAZMAT shipping solution to ship our products that contain lithium ion batteries which was previously a challenge for another large 3PL company we were using. They do a good job with this and we've had almost no problems so far.",

        "review_content": "Cahoot has been an amazing addition to our business. We needed a partner that allowed us to ship faster, have shipping labels created automatically, and control our shipping costs. We could find other products that did one or two items well, but they never did the entire package and at the same time continue to be affordable. With Cahoot we are able pick, pack and ship so much faster. Before, we were routinely rushing until 6pm to get orders out, but now, we're done most days by 4pm and that leaves us a 1-hour break to clean up and ensure everything is completed successfully. Our shipping supervisors are actually able to supervise the entire process rather than just the shipping label process, which will make our entire team more efficient. As a result, we've changed our team's hours and they get out of work earlier and we are getting more done than just taking care of orders (cleaning, maintenance, etc.). The best part - we've been able to reduce our numbers by 2 employees. The ability to make sure that team members know what boxes to use is also invaluable. We are able to maintain inventory of boxes which means we know when to order more and can better budget for this cost. It also means that all team members are using the same box for items and it's the most cost effective box.Additionally, the Cahoot team is amazing to work with. They are organized and have the training expertly set up. They are responsive and always helpful. I look forward to seeing what they come up with next because I know it will be great. I also appreciate their knowledge in the industry and their understanding and leadership on what it takes to meet all the ecommerce and marketplace requirements.Cahoot will not dissapoint you!",

The technology is easy to use and I feel confident in the quality control methods implemented to make sure orders are accurately fulfilled. By requiring operators to scan and verify each item as they're packed, the error rate is essentially zero. If any issue does arise, it's always a quick and easy support ticket away from resolution. Usually they respond within minutes and there's no delay in shipment. As a fulfillment partner we are also required to conduct bi-weekly cycle counts which helps to keep all parties on the same page. To this date, we've never been unable to fulfill an order due to missing inventory. Operating as a fulfillment company is not easy. It takes a ton of organization and flexibility but the Cahoot system really takes on a lot of the work. I'm hopeful that Cahoot will continue to innovate and update their technology. I love that they actively reach out and talk with us about our needs and what features we'd like to see implemented. I can see that they're invested in our success and I appreciate their commitment to a long term and positive relationship.",

After we signed on with them and after they took our money for a year upfront and after shipped our inventory into their warehouse, they presented us with a new lop-sided Agreement that no sane person could sign (I apologize to anyone who signed this agreement because you felt you had no choice).  We had to take back our inventory and lost over $10000 with this company. They refuse to refund for prepaid service and damage caused by their warehouse.   (1) I believe that no honest company would present a new agreement and service levels that are undisclosed till after they take your money and hold your inventory hostage.  (2) They accept no responsibility for any intentional or non intentional errors or damage to your inventory while demanding their fulfilment partners accept full responsibility for the same for any errors or mistakes and (3) they are falsifying positive reviews as @Corey Tournet reported in his review.  Many of the reviews here are by ownership or management in Cahoot.",

        "review_content": "Can't say enough good things about this company. \u00a0I am a CFP (Cahoot Fulfilment Partner) so my warehouse and staff fill orders for Cahoot sellers.Over the last 3 years I have had the opportunity to experience the incredible capabilities of Cahoot.ai, and I must say, it has completely revolutionized the way I view order fulfillment. This platform is nothing short of a game-changer for anyone looking for order fulfilment capacity without the expenses of warehousing, staff or all the other costs associated with filling your own online orders. \u00a0Cahoot relies on a network of hundreds of warehouses all over the country and can direct your orders to the warehouse that is closest to your buyer, reducing transit time and shipping label costs.From the moment I started using Cahoot.ai, I was impressed by its intuitive interface and user-friendly design. It's evident that the developers put a lot of thought into creating an environment that fosters seamless communication, efficient teamwork as well as easy and lowest-cost order fulfilment. \u00a0The real-time visibility Cahoot.ai provides for both CFP's and sellers is nothing short of amazing. Sellers can track shipments, monitor inventory levels, and identify potential bottlenecks in real-time, allowing you to proactively address issues and keep clients informed. This level of transparency can greatly enhance customer relationships and instill confidence in the ability to meet buyer needs consistently.The mechanisms in place for me, as a CFP, allow me and my staff to quickly fill hundreds of orders per day and the \"scan verify\" component ensures all of the orders ship with the correct product, quantity and packaging which reduces the sellers shipping costs and eliminates buyer complaints. \u00a0I am very happy to continue my work with Cahoot.ai and look forward to many more years in our working relationship.",

I tried for the longest time to get some resolution with customer support, but they were adamant that they are doing the right thing by double-billing, and they absolutely would not credit back the convenience fee nor make changes to their billing procedure, although I painstakingly described the problem to them. For such abominable billing practices and lack of any effort at customer service, I give them one star.",

        "review_content": "Insured shipment 1ZF1V5924239908938 for $2000. Damaged in transit, which is surprising because most of my customers praise my superior shipping and packaging practices. Sent all pictures of damage and requested the repair amount which would amount to $1200. Then I was told my claim was denied due to insufficient packaging after an underwhelming investigation. Item was packaged perfectly as are all our parcels, and the customer recieved a damaged beaten box with damaged goods inside. I can no longer trust my business with the insurance provided by EasyPost. I had recommended easypost to so many fellow business owners, I will now have to actively go around and let them know my poor experience, unless a solution is provided in a timely manner.",

        "review_content": "We started using Metapack when we first launched online in 2010. The system was fine in the early days. As our volumes grew significantly over the following years, our operation became more complex and subsequently, we required greater resilience and flexibility in our carrier allocation. We found Metapacks rules engine, which was virtually unchanged since 2010 to be clunky and awkward to use. Support was extremely slow, and responses often unhelpful. Adding a new carrier or service was a slow and drawn-out affair. Account management at Metapack, in my opinion, was very poor, and we were unable to improve our label rates despite huge volume growth. Ultimately, we decided to leave. We found another solution, which as well as being cheaper, had a much more fluid and intuitive rules system which has supported our business really well through the massive spike in demand due to COVID-19. 1 year after we left, Metapack drew around \u00a35,100 from our direct debit. They issued no invoice for this. On querying it, an invoice was raised for an account minimum of \u00a3350/month dating back a little over a year. They had not invoiced us monthly like they did when we were with them, so we had no advice of these charges. We have raised this concern with Metapack, and we\u2019ve not been able to resolve it. They said we never formally notified them we had left and they had technical issues preventing them invoicing monthly. For a year. I pointed out how unfair this was and they just don\u2019t seem to care. As we have grown our e-commerce operation over the last 10 years I have dealt with dozens of solutions providers, and I have never experienced anything like the treatment we had from Metapack. I am so glad we left, and with how we have been treated after we left, I will never look back. Account reference10018744",

The platform did help us simplify our RMA process although we've experienced many technical issues since it's not as compatible with Magento. Support has been available to address our concerns although sometimes the solution takes time to work through and involves more back and forth than we would like. The shipment tracker was a much easier implementation which we have been happy with. Our customers prefer the ease of use and the look & feel of the layout.",

When I travel overseas, I usually buy a tube of Acyclovir Topical to keep on hand.  If I catch the start of the cold sore, I can usually prevent a full break out.  Because of COVID, my supply was well beyond it's expiration.  Instead of cream, I requested a prescription for Valacyclovir tablets.  I thought I give it a try instead of the cream.  I went through the online interview and provided my insurance information.  It took several days to approve the prescription, then another few days to be informed I had a co-pay, and another few days before they shipped the prescription.  In total, 11 days and I'm still waiting.  In the meantime, the cold sore came and went. Other online services have been far more responsive, often receiving a prescription within hours.",

If I was forewarned that Narvar was going to be used I would cancel the order immediately. I tried to find an answer to my dilemma - but nobody takes responsibility so I cannot retract my claim against seller, NARVAR, shipping company. So here it remains.Response from NAVAR:Thanks for reaching out to Narvar support. Narvar works with companies to provide a tracking page. Narvar does not have any order information and Narvar does not deliver the products. You will need to reach out to either the company you purchased from or you can reach out to the carrier who is delivering your package. Best,Lisa",

Which, in turn, gives a feeling of trust and transparency during the returns and refunds process.",

This is extra frustrating because I moved on January 12th and not only was I expecting the package to come before then now I have to go back to the old house to check only to get dissapointed each day that my package is still not here Narvar is awful I hope you read this and change the way you do buisness if I ever see you as my shipper again on another item I am canceling immediately!",

The icing on the cake is absolutely their analytics they offer on shipping from a per carrier to service level of each carrier.",

        "review_content": "I purchased a new franking machine from them in 2023. I was told that I needed to have a maintenance agreement with them otherwise they couldn\u2019t install it. The sales person was very pushy and adamant about this so I reluctantly agreed. I told them I would agree to it for a year only and I did not want it to auto renew. In July of this year I received an invoice for about \u00a3350 for a new contract. I rang them to say I didn\u2019t want it and told them of my conversation with the sales person a year earlier. They said they had no record of that conversation and I therefore had to pay \u00a3103 cancellation fee. I disputed this with them and they stuck to the same reason as to why I had to make payment. I invited them to take me to county court to let a judge opine on the matter. This went back and forth for two months - me having to explain to various people what the background was without progress. Three days ago the sent an error code to our machine blocking it and preventing us from using it until we paid. In the end we had no option but to pay. They are the most awful organisation to deal with and bullied us into paying \u00a3103 which we should never have been charged.",

It shipped to the US quickly, got through customs fast, and then... a Pitney Bowes facility for -at the time of writing- one month and eleven days. I have ordered other overseas packages using different shippers that were ordered *after this package cleared customs* which have already been delivered. Based on the reviews I've been reading, I'm guessing they're either trying to fleece the seller for more money or they've lost the package and I'll never get it. What a joke.",

They rarely respond, and on the rare occasion they do, issues remain unresolved.We have had multiple claims, and I\u2019m not just talking about delayed shipments. When products are damaged, even with clear evidence (pictures before and after, and even photos from the carrier\u2019s hub showing shattered pieces on the floor), we have never once received a refund. It honestly seems impossible to win a claim with them or get any reimbursement, even if you are lucky enough to get a response.The last incident? A small, soft plastic hot water bottle was destroyed . Not only did our customer receive an unusable item, but we were also charged \u20ac199.33 because it was somehow weighed at 18.3 kg!

After signing up, I was assigned my account Manager who's name is Serdar. Serdar has been AMAZING. After finding out more about my new business, he has \"held my hand\" every step of the way, Firstly through regular Zoom calls to begin with, helping me set up my SendClound Account and then with telephone calls to check up on how things are going with me and always quick to reply to my emails.Based on my interaction with Serdar, I will highly recommend SendCloud to any business needing software to run properly, first time from order through to delivery including tracking.",

Instead, they revel in letting you repeatedly enter the same ticket, regurgitate all the necessary data... after which they close the ticket, never to be heard of again.Of course all the chat communication takes place along the well-rehearsed scripts of very polite and understanding lip service, so that's nice.

What really sets them apart past the competitive rates is the service, so rarely can you just get something done now in business. It's all emails, 5 days response etc, but not with Sendcloud. The small amount of issues and concerns we've had have been addressed in no time from onboarding to the continual running of the service. As well as regular spot checks and calls from the management to go hand in hand. Thanks again guys we look forward to the future !",

This worked fine for around five months, before all hell let loose.Little did I know that sendcloud\u2019s automation has had issues and was assigning all of my 2-15kg parcels as a \u20181kg\u2019 parcel, which then would cost me around \u00a32.50 of surcharges when they invoice me.I thought it was me at first, but having checked the system for five weeks now, it\u2019s SendCloud themselves who are to blame. Contacted them via a phone call but the number they give you isn\u2019t correct (it took them two months to rectify this, as per emails). This still isn\u2019t fixed, but they\u2019ve promised me it\u2019ll be fixed by the end of the week.Saying I pay \u00a32,500 a month for this service, I thought it would be better. Automations don\u2019t work, SendCloud don\u2019t contact the courier quick enough, and the phone number they give you is incorrect. What am I paying for?",

        "review_content": "At MADISON, we chose Sendcloud as our Shopify shipping partner because of the ease of integration but quickly ran into a few edge cases that needed special attention when we hooked the two systems up. The issues occurred because of the complex nature of our ordering system, and not because of Sendcloud's feature set. Serdar and Ben went above and beyond to help ensure the integrity of the data we imported to Sendcloud, and they had us up and running in no time. This, coupled with the exceptional customer care, competitive shipping rates, and ease of platform use, make Sendcloud a brilliant choice for new Shopify customers, looking to streamline fulfilment or shipping.",

        "review_content": "We\u2019ve been using Sendcloud with our Magento store for several years, and it\u2019s been a transformative experience for us. Instead of dealing with multiple integrations for each shipping company, Sendcloud brought them all together in one platform. This gives us the flexibility to quickly choose and compare shipping rates with ease.After reading some reviews, I felt the need to share my personal experience. Some store owners have mentioned issues with their shipments, customer support, and the ticketing system. While I can\u2019t deny these problems exist, in my experience, they\u2019re not as severe as some people claim.As a store owner, it\u2019s crucial to add a margin to your product costs to cover the risks of lost or damaged parcels. This is something unavoidable whether you use Sendcloud or any other platform. Regarding insurance issues, Sendcloud acts only as an intermediary; they simply convey the information from the insurance company and do nothing beyond that.Another point worth mentioning is that long-time users of Sendcloud (3+ years) have noticed a drop in service quality recently. Previously, customer support was more efficient, and response times were quicker. However, from a technical standpoint, the platform continues to improve and become more user-friendly.The cost of using Sendcloud has steadily increased over time. Although the names of the fees may change, you\u2019ll find yourself paying more. Additionally, we\u2019ve observed that shipping rates we agreed upon at the start were disregarded after a few months, and we don\u2019t believe we\u2019re benefiting from the discounts initially promised.Sendcloud should take on more responsibility for parcels rather than merely acting as a middleman between store owners, shipping companies, and insurance firms. It\u2019s reasonable to expect some compensation for losses, given the amount we pay to Sendcloud itself.In conclusion, using Sendcloud doesn\u2019t reduce the risks your shipments face. The main reason to use it is the ease of use and convenience it offers for managing shipping.",

Be careful.--- update - 19/12/2022 ---notwithstanding our differences and the bad experience highlighted above, the issue has been taken at heart by Sendcloud, especially by the same team I tried to solve the issue with at the beginning. Since then, they remained available to provide me assistance and answer specific questions that require internal collaboration and exchange of information. Hence, I updated my review from 1 to 4 stars. I hope we can have ways to collaborate together in the future so that I can update my review again.

        "review_content": "I tried to create a removal order for stock in the ShipHero US warehouse to ship to our UK warehouse over 5 weeks ago but it is still not ready for collection. It is apparently packed onto pallets but it has taken over 3 weeks to be provided a packing list (which we still don't have!)At this rate, it looks like the stock will not arrive in time for Black Friday in the UK which will cost us a fortune in lost sales. We have been given the run around by the customer service rep who has been unable to provide a simple packing list or reply to an email. I would strongly suggest avoiding ShipHero based on the customer experience we have had.",

His customer care is very prompt, friendly, and he works to resolve issues truly end-to-end. My overall experience with ShipHero has been varied. While they are good at fulfilling domestic orders in a timely manner, there were hiccups when it came to their international partner. There was also quality control for special items like handling artwork, gift packaging, etc. I wasn't told when a special project was needed to ensure those items would survive the packing stage without damage.

Only then was I told that there would be additional costs for VAT compliance, taxes, fees, fuel, etc. It ended up being around $20 to ship a pair of sunglasses! Working with their partner Passport made matters even worse. If you're shipping only in the US and get a better warehouse (like SLC) this might be a good option but if you're doing international, I would steer clear. You're better off shipping from China. I chose ShipHero to streamline operations. It turned out to be a two-month disaster that nearly sunk my business.",

Orders take more than 1-2 weeks to ship out and I have to manually fulfill all of them now and use my own stock. I'm just grateful i can do this because after emailing 3 times and getting the orders \"marked priority\" they still don't go out.

Shippo made an outrageous \"address validation\" invoice for around 9000 orders at once (Nearly $1000 USD) with no breakdown of how these charges could have occurred. The fact we have only used shippo for a handful of orders this year. They keep attempting to charge the card daily, even though it has been reported to customer service and they acknowledge there is a widespread error. We will have to pursue the fraudulent charges through the bank like the other recent review. Very disappointing as we have used the service for around 6 years.",

We hope this review could warn many other businesses to stay away from shippo, unless you are actively using the platform and then address validation makes sense.

If something happens to your product in shipping you are basically not able to actually file a claim. A claim has to be filed within 10 days of it being delivered. This does not work if you ship with Amazon and the customer has 30 days to return the item. You need to get the product back from the customer to get photos to submit the claim within the 10 days of delivering it to the customer. So the customer is supposed to just get it and ship it back right away. This doesn't happen with Amazon customers. Therefore, all claims become invalid and you can not submit. The timeframe for a claim is a joke.",

We opened a \"dispute\" with Shippo and after 20 days, Shippo could tell us no new information. They refused to send us the itemized invoice, would not let us talk to FedEx ourselves, and ignored requests for proof that they were actually in conversation with FedEx. Our bank advised us to open a dispute as we had zero information on the charge and were not getting any information. Immediately after opening the dispute, Shippo \"shadow blocked\" our account, ruined our operational shipping flow, and refuses to continue any conversation until the dispute is dropped. We're not going to pay for an illegal charge- I guess we'll have to switch over to Pirate Ship like so many other people here :-/. It's really a shame that Shippo wouldn't just communicate better to resolve this amicably with transparency.7/31 UPDATE: Shippo reactivated our account, but there is no movement on the dispute. I hope it can be resolved. The invoicing system is severely lacking in shipment details. Sometimes there's just a single line charge with no explanation that doesn't match shipments.",

        "review_content": "I love and use shippo almost daily. It is free, its easy to use, and is great however there is one small feature that I feel needs to be included. I mail to teh same customers repeatedly and it would be nice to have a customer address book where you could save your customers in order to autofill the customers information and address for your labels. This way you wouldn't have to add their address manually every single or via a CSV. The reason being is that I only have a few shipments daily and taking teh time to create a CSV would simply be time wasted. A customer address book is truly needed and I for one would not have an issue paying a small payment monthly for this option to be included.",

However, recently a package was damaged, I paid $22 extra for insurance, and shippo is making it so difficult to file the claim, it almost isn't worth it. They need \"proof\" it's not repairable or 2 repair estimates. I've spent one whole day trying to get repair quotes and nobody will do it unless I pay $280 for the quote. Shippo is basically saying that's my problem. If I can't get repair estimates they won't honor the claim. Since nobody repairs this type of thing, the insurance was a waste. I will never use shippo again. The small savings is lost when you factor in both the time and the $$ spent on insurance and lost or damage goods",

        "review_content": "I've been using shipping for the past couple of months. I would advise no one to use Shippo for their business parcels - there are more professional companies at one's disposal, or just ship from USPS. I have a professional postal scale. I always round off to the next highest pound. 99% of the time my parcels are considerably less in weight -  by more than 6 ounces in weight. Consistently Shippo has charged my account an overcharge for weight - which is impossible. On a couple of occasions I was charged for an oversized box which is also unjustified. Box sizes are exact, size printed on the box, and I don't over stuff. I have a medical supply business, units are well insulated for transportation, I don't stuff my boxes. Today I received a $5.21 surcharge for a shipment made on February 14th! Over a month ago! I've shipped many orders since that date. Dishonest company.  Stay away",

I've had problems getting prices from Fedex due to a \"NOTE: The destination state/province code has been changed.\" (x2) but looking deeper, only Hermes is supported in the UK and therefore this entire product is pointless and support could have said that it is due to this... but nope. Or is it? \"Shippo supports FedEx, DHL Express, and UPS, as long as those services exist within that country and your account is enabled for domestic shipping\" Either way support had no intention of spending any time looking into this. Surely they should know what causes there own system to throw the above error, as they are the ones that created the verbose for the error and therefore the conditions of display.... Either way Shippo doesn't seem to care.",

The multiple user feature means I can restrict what staff see and access. I no longer have to search across multiple platforms looking for orders and having centralised statistics gives me a better overview of our performance.Alex and the team have been really helpful.

        "review_content": "Support is terrible: emails support staff has no idea whether ShipStation offers cubic pricing: 50,000 packages are needed to qulify but I show him cubic pricing labels we created before May 2022. For over 2 months, the case is still open. Then, waited for more than half an hour (41 in queue) finally had to chance to chat. I was told ShipStation does offer cubic pricing. When I show him/her a 0.1 cubic foot package, 6 zone shipping, the rate is $12.03! I said this is incorrect based on Stamps.com or USPS officially published rate, I was told ShipStation has different negotiated rate! That is funniest I've ever heard: excuse me, negotaited higher rates? I showed $9.18 from Shippo, which is exactly same as that from Stamps.com's cubic pricing rate chart! $9.18 vs $12.03, no reason to use ShipStation!",

Similarly sending and sharing locations is now simple on any platform.I'm converted and now a big fan of What 3 Words and am looking forward to on going development. I am especially keen to see dark mode mapping introduced on Android W3W apps. Keep going W3W and don't loose your way.",

I spend most of my life either on my farm or others and simple tasks like drain locations, pipes and other services are really easy to map, save and share with others. I\u2019ve needed a field drain clearing and it take seconds to send a really accurate location to someone instead of the old way of telling them to take 20 steps south and 5 step east from a tree that you forgot blew down 2 years earlier. I also hire storage tanks and it\u2019s really useful to plot exactly where they are if you need to send someone else in to collect them, and when a customer sends you the location for delivery. I have saved hours and countless miles finding everything all the time, first time.",

If you're willing to navigate the landscape of data collection and enjoy being compensated for sharing your purchasing habits, Fetch offers a sweet deal that's hard to resist.Now, let's address the elephant in the room\u2014the data collection. Fetch is straightforward about its approach, collecting and likely selling data about your purchasing habits. While this may raise concerns for some, the compensation offered in varying amounts, leading to gift cards or sweepstakes entries for attractive prizes, is a fair trade-off for those comfortable with this arrangement.While the website aspect of Fetch might not be the main focus, as the platform is primarily app-based, the app itself is a standout feature. Using Fetch feels like turning receipt scanning into a game where winning points is the only option. The interface is user-friendly, making the process enjoyable and effortless. It's a refreshing take on turning a mundane task into something engaging.I highly recommend Fetch to avid shoppers, especially those who frequently succumb to promotional offers. The app is notorious for incentivizing purchases of certain brands and products, accelerating your journey toward gift card redemption goals. For shoppers who don't mind the data exchange and love a good deal, Fetch is a win-win.",

After receiving parcel force tracking saying that my parcel had been delivered to hubbox  store, i awaited my code that did not arrive.  I called the store and enquired and the lady simply said \"I do not deal with the parcels\" and slammed the phone down, tried multiple times to call, with the same result.I emailed hub box on Monday and still they have not even bothered to contact me directly.

I went to the store to collect it and the storekeeper said he couldn't hand it over.  He said there had been some changes and the Hub Box number was no longer on the system. There was no way to enter confirmation of collection and he wouldn't be able to prove that I had collected it.  He told the courier that he couldn't accept the package but the courier said he had to do the delivery and wouldn't take it away. In the end the storekeeper agreed to hand over my package after I had sent an email to the retailer to confirm my receipt of the item but what a crazy situation.  This was the first and last time I use this service as I have zero confidence in it.",

        "review_content": "I work in a shop now dealing with Hub-Box parcels (via Collect+), and have never seen such a disorganized service. Hub-Box have consistently failed to get hold of their customer email addresses to notify them of the parcel's delivery (we return them after 14 days), and to send them the necessary code to collect it. It seems customers rarely even know their parcels are 'Hub-Box' parcels (they're being tracked through Yodel/etc), and 50% of them never receive the Collection Code that is required for them to pick it up. It's frustrating for both the retailer and the customer, since we need that Collection Code to process the parcel correctly, even if we can verify their order, identity, etc, if we don't have the code, we aren't supposed to hand it over. When we first received a random Hub-Box parcel last year, I phoned my manager to confirm if we did it, and he didn't know either (or what it was). I assumed any issues like customers not receiving their Collection Codes would be resolved in the next few months, but it is still happening with the same frequency, and it is destroying the trust between the shop and our customers whenever it happens.Hub-Box's integration into the Collect+ (PayPoint) service seems like another unreliable and unnecessary cog in the wheel, further complicating parcel delivery at the recipient's expense.",

Their slip they left behind stated my name and a date, no other information. I run a business and thus have no idea which of the hundreds of tracking numbers I have this would relate to. I now have a missed delivery with no idea how to get my package nor whatever it is. Being able to search by name and leaving sufficient information to identify the package is the bare minimum of expected abilities of a shipping company. Oh note, I did not ever pick this company to deliver a package. I never will after this experience and will be mandating the companies I purchase from to ban them from shipping my products further after this experience.",

Then, when he reached my floor & started walking down the hallway towards my unit, he noticed I was standing in my doorway waiting for him.  He proceeded to \"run\" down the hallway, so as not to have me wait too long for him. He was also smiling & so pleasant (& it was a Saturday!).  So unnecessary to run, but GREAT customer service!

I contacted Intelcom to request a call from the driver upon delivery, but the driver did not come and falsely marked the package as attempted delivery. When I called back, the office was closed.The next day, I learned that my package would now be delivered on the 22nd. I reiterated my request for a call before delivery. At 1:30 PM, I was told the driver would arrive around 4:00 PM, as I was the 257th delivery. However, at 3:30 PM, I called again to confirm, only to find that the driver once again marked the delivery as attempted without showing up. Intelcom informed me that they would deliver it the following day.This entire experience has been incredibly frustrating. I ordered an item for next-day delivery, and I have no idea when it will actually arrive. I have requested that Amazon lower this company's priority in my delivery options. If I receive another package through Intelcom, I will reconsider my business with Amazon, and I encourage others to do the same to help eliminate this company's operations.",

Every other courier and delivery service manages to do correct deliveries in our building. Usually not Intelcom. I know delivering parcels is not necessarily a great job, but if someone is going to take a job, they should actually do it or find something more to their liking.

I had to go down to get the parel.This time I received a message that at 1:57 stating they would be here in the next 3 hours (5  p.m.). There was a message on Amazon claiming they ran into an issue trying to deliver parcel. Meanwhile there have been 2 Amazon deliveries to this Senior's Apartment building, which has only 2 floors.Well, I was here waiting, can you read or understand English?  Or what is your problem this time? No one rang my buzzer or attempted to deliver the parcel to my door.  If you are supposed to try again, when is that supposed to be?  Please read delivery instructions on Amazon, or have someone read them to delivery person.",

        "review_content": "It\u2019s frustrating to deal with such an unreliable delivery service. Today (Sept 30), I received an email saying my package was delivered, but I haven't received anything. I contacted Zara and Packaly\u2019s customer service. Zara\u2019s representative, told me the system shows the package as delivered, but it\u2019s possible they marked it as delivered even though it hasn\u2019t been and I must wait 48 hours. That explanation doesn\u2019t make sense to me, and this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve had issues like this with packaly, unfortunately. My T & T number is: 069773777262It\u2019s disappointing that Packaly doesn\u2019t seem to care where they deliver packages as long as they mark them as delivered. It shows to me that PacakIy staff is very irresponsible and the company doesn\u2019t care about their clients, therefore they treat them very badly! I find this extremely unprofessional, and because of repeated issues, I will no longer use Packaly for any future deliveries.",

Since so many packages get left with the building anyway, FREE OF CHARGE, it\u2019s absolutely pointless to use this service.Maybe if someone lives in a sketchy place where their packages get stolen, but even then, only a small percentage of delivery personnel even use it.

At first you might think: \"Okay, this is propably just a technical issue\", but is it really?????This has been goin on for over a year, and they've charged me over $100 in $3 payments for packages that supposedly haven't been picked up!

I will be bringing this up on the next board call for the condo association, it's disgusting to pay for a service and be abused like this. They really don't give a rats a$$ and it's impossible to get anyone on the phone.",

So, my account was registered but the system was not registering my username or password. Cheri was able to go in and help with that.

I called again and THANK GOD FOR Jessie Romo - Bilingual Customer Relations. When I tell you she saved the day yesterday she provided top-tier customer service and I am very grateful to her. The other agent is why I won't give 5 stars, I recommend maybe allowing workers like Jessie to provide training to the individuals who do not have the required level of customer service like I said she is TOP TIER.

        "review_content": "In June 2024, I ordered a suit dress from Novara Mode\u2014a fraudulent website that partners with Peddler to \"deliver\" its fake products. Peddler marked the package as \u201cdelivered\u201d even though I never received it. When I reached out, Peddler initially promised to start the refund process, but unsurprisingly, nothing happened. After multiple follow-ups, they claimed there was nothing they could do as a \u201cthird party\u201d\u2014a convenient excuse but hardly reassuring.The real issue here is Peddler\u2019s association with scam websites. By partnering with fraudulent sellers and claiming to handle delivery for non-existent products, Peddler is complicit in misleading customers. I\u2019ll never trust Peddler as a delivery service again and will avoid any website associated with them. They\u2019ve made it to my personal \u201cred flags\u201d list for online scams.Stay vigilant and avoid Peddler if you value your money and peace of mind!",

        "review_content": "I had a really disappointing experience with Peddler\u2019s delivery service. I placed an order that was supposed to be delivered on November 6th. I specifically stayed home that day just to receive this package as quickly as possible. While checking their live tracking website, I saw the driver was nearby, so I waited by the door, ready to answer. No knock, no doorbell\u2014nothing. Then I check the tracking again, and it says \u201ccustomer not answering.\u201d I was literally there, waiting! I immediately sent an email saying that if they couldn't find me, they could leave it downstairs. Did they do that? No. Instead, I got a message saying \u201csorry,\u201d and that they would attempt delivery the next day.So, for the second day in a row, I stayed home specifically for this package. This time, the app said \u201ccannot find address.\u201d Really? I reached out again to explain I was home and provided my address details, but I got the same empty apologies and promises to deliver \u201cas soon as possible.\u201dToday, I emailed them again to ask if they could deliver to a different address, but I received no response\u2014same story with my follow-up email. Is there a phone number to call? Nope. Just dead silence.Honestly, this company is frustrating and unprofessional. They have poor communication, unreliable delivery, and zero accountability. Avoid them if you value your time and sanity!",

        "review_content": "The price of the bed was cheaper than if I bought it directly however on receiving it, I realised that it was too big for the space available. I contacted Peddler two days after it was delivered to find out how I could return it as I could not see an option in my customer account to create a return. I did not receive a response after 5 days so I sent them an email and it is now another 4 days and still no response. Considering the seller has a 14 day return policy, I am weary that I would be stuck with a bulky item I do not need! Really disappointed with the service received from Peddler or lack thereof.Update: Peddler helped to facilitate the return; would certainly consider purchasing through their site in the future.",

I am left waiting for a person to pick up the goods and then have to explain to my customers why their delivery is going to be late.  I have waited for over 3 weeks to get a refund on a pick up order that I had to cancel and deliver my self... because the courier could not pick it up nor could I be given a real ETA of when they could do so.  I have used their pickup/delivery service for most of 2022 with a 50% success rate of them picking up in the window of time reserved.On a positive note, I can always get them on the phone to speak to a customer service person.",

No reply. Now a week later i check the track and trace, which states that it was attempted again (without pre notification or a mail after) and now my package it returned to the sender.

It's crucial for companies to acknowledge that the delivery stage serves as the pivotal touchpoint between the buyer and seller. This final interaction is the ultimate opportunity to leave a lasting impression, fostering consumer satisfaction and loyalty and Peddler offers excellent people and services to help with this.

We did not get any of our money back and basically wasted $1,099! They did not let us know or anything, as they did not respond back to any emails. The only way I had found out that the company had collapsed, was by searching the company on the internet and then boom I found a ton of articles! When I tell you I was shocked! The company was messy, giving alcohol to minors and doing drugs in the office! If you can do drugs, you can respond back to my emails! Stop playing with me and my money. In conclusion, the company no longer exists and if you had booked through them, you will not see your moeny refunded back to you.",

The craziest part is that they have delivered to my house from the same site on 3 separate occasions this year alone.

I contacted customer service and they just keep sending pics of the item delivered to the wrong address saying it was delivered. I finally got frustrated with them and contacted Zulilly who reshipped the product. And once again, TForce delivered the package to the wrong address. Customer service keeps saying they have submitted the complaint to higher but haven't heard back from them. It's been 11 days since the product was delivered to the wrong location, and they told me to wait another 24 hours to see if they hear back from higher ups. Worst company ever",

Supposed two day delivery is now SIX  days - Tforce appears to assume NO responsibilty. Extremely bad experience.***Dec. 04, 2023 - Asked again for address - holding $500 parcel hostage while they try to figure out what to do - NO response as to new shipment date / tracker number - now Dec. 05, 2023 and still no feedback from Tforce - called customer service and basically was told \"too bad\" - we need your phone number **AGAIN** - seriously thinking now of lawsuit",

After seeing my package was out for delivery, I expected it within the day, but came to find it was marked as undeliverable due to denied access.  This was obviously a lie as the same day TFORCE claimed to be attempting delivery, I also received a delivery from Amazon.  The Amazon driver was able to use the keypad at my apartment building and I was able to allow them access to my building.  The next day TFORCE again claimed to be out for delivery and again claimed to have been denied access to my building.  At the end of day two, my package was marked as \"return to sender\". I checked the front of my building and our mail room, there was no pick up slip left by the delivery driver.  The fact that their drivers are not trained on how apartment buildings work and do not allow for later pick up is so strange.  When I contacted their customer service I was told once packages are returned to sender it is out of their hands.  When I asked why my buzzer was never rung or why I was never called to grant building access I never received a response.",

I set up for another delivery as their site says they're to make 2 attempts. Nothing, they never tried again. I scheduled for a re delivery as they said maybe my address was wrong. It was not. Nothing happened for 2 days. I finally called and asked for the product to be re shipped and was told they'd update my order w a new tracking number. I just had another ticket placed that I had an issue but no resolve. Another 2 days I see my package was sitting at the warehouse. I call again and was told this would be escalated to their supervisor because I expressed my frustration. Within 24 hours the \"supervisor\" emailed me that they don't deliver to my area and contact the company I bought from to use another service. Meanwhile, the day before I saw two uni uni packages for another tenant in the mail room and I live in a big city, not a rural town,  for them to say that. They're horrible and liars. I'll deal w companies that don't use them and because of them Shapermint had to refund me but after more back and forth.",

        "review_content": "To be clear, UniUni did deliver my item in an undamaged condition. That's the reason they got two stars instead of one--and that means they did the bare minimum. If you want to use a bare minimum company, these folks are for you!I ordered an item online from someone other than Amazon--something I rarely do. Instead of delivering the package to my door (and dropping it behind a large pillar so it's not visible to package thieves), the lazy slug who delivered my item left it in plain view in front of my garage door. Fortunately, I was working from home and have security cameras that give me alerts, so I was able to retrieve the package almost immediately. How lazy are these drivers/delivery people? Too lazy to walk another 50 feet to ensure my package was out of sight at my doorstep? I'm writing the vendor (from which I'd planned to order other items) to tell them I will NOT order from them again if they are going to use UniUni to deliver. Amazon, FedEx and UPS have spoiled us. Even the USPS is a cut above these goofballs.",

They steal packages, lie about deliveries, and provide false information about delivery attempts. I\u2019ve been forced to stop shopping at stores like SHEIN, Temu, and LuvMe Hair because they all use this unreliable courier to save a few bucks.Since July, I haven\u2019t received any packages at my address, and after I complained, they claimed they no longer deliver to my location. This feels like retaliation, especially since they had previously accepted my packages for delivery. Their customer service is a complete joke and they don\u2019t answer the phone. If you email them, they take days to reply. I\u2019ve had to dispute charges for packages that were never received and have reported UniUni to the BBB and the state attorney general multiple times.Despite the overwhelming number of complaints, they still operate without accountability. I\u2019ve documented every failed delivery and saved all customer service exchanges. It\u2019s outrageous that they\u2019re allowed to handle packages when they consistently fail to deliver. Avoid UniUni at all costs!",

This happened while my wife was momentarily distracted, taking our two-month-old child out of the car and into the house.We immediately reached out to UniUni multiple times, desperately seeking their assistance in the active police investigation. The police were tracking the stolen phone via GPS and needed information about the driver to apprehend them. Shockingly, UniUni failed to provide any meaningful help or cooperation. Their complete lack of responsiveness and disregard for the seriousness of the situation is beyond unacceptable.It's deeply concerning that UniUni employs individuals who engage in criminal behavior and then refuses to take responsibility or assist in rectifying the situation. This raises serious questions about their hiring practices and whether they conduct proper background checks on their employees.I strongly advise anyone considering using UniUni's services to think twice. Their negligence and indifference have caused our family immense stress and violated our sense of security in our own home. Companies like this should not be in business if they can't ensure the safety and trustworthiness of their employees.Would give zero stars if possible.",

I start clicking thru the status links and land on a page for \"UniUni\". It says they returned the package to their warehouse undelivered because it had the \"wrong address\". I had no idea what \"UniUni\" was until I looked them up, and discovered they are the delivery equivalent of a labrador retriever designing nuclear weapons- wholly incompetent. I have attempted several inquiries thru their website, with each rejected as a website failure. I would rather the vendor add in the fee for delivery by the known providers UPS, FedEx, or USPS than save a few coins by using this scam of a \"delivery company\".",

I called when I noticed this by the afternoon when I checked tracking as absolutely no contact or update had been made.

I set up for another delivery as their site says they're to make 2 attempts. Nothing, they never tried again. I scheduled for a re delivery as they said maybe my address was wrong. It was not. Nothing happened for 2 days. I finally called and asked for the product to be re shipped and was told they'd update my order w a new tracking number. I just had another ticket placed that I had an issue but no resolve. Another 2 days I see my package was sitting at the warehouse. I call again and was told this would be escalated to their supervisor because I expressed my frustration. Within 24 hours the \"supervisor\" emailed me that they don't deliver to my area and contact the company I bought from to use another service. Meanwhile, the day before I saw two uni uni packages for another tenant in the mail room and I live in a big city, not a rural town,  for them to say that. They're horrible and liars. I'll deal w companies that don't use them and because of them Shapermint had to refund me but after more back and forth.",

Instead of delivering the package to my door (and dropping it behind a large pillar so it's not visible to package thieves), the lazy slug who delivered my item left it in plain view in front of my garage door. Fortunately, I was working from home and have security cameras that give me alerts, so I was able to retrieve the package almost immediately. How lazy are these drivers/delivery people? Too lazy to walk another 50 feet to ensure my package was out of sight at my doorstep? I'm writing the vendor (from which I'd planned to order other items) to tell them I will NOT order from them again if they are going to use UniUni to deliver. Amazon, FedEx and UPS have spoiled us.

This feels like retaliation, especially since they had previously accepted my packages for delivery. Their customer service is a complete joke and they don\u2019t answer the phone. If you email them, they take days to reply. I\u2019ve had to dispute charges for packages that were never received and have reported UniUni to the BBB and the state attorney general multiple times.Despite the overwhelming number of complaints, they still operate without accountability.

On October 24, 2024, one of their delivery drivers not only delivered our package but also stole my wife's phone right off our front porch! This happened while my wife was momentarily distracted, taking our two-month-old child out of the car and into the house.We immediately reached out to UniUni multiple times, desperately seeking their assistance in the active police investigation. The police were tracking the stolen phone via GPS and needed information about the driver to apprehend them. Shockingly, UniUni failed to provide any meaningful help or cooperation. Their complete lack of responsiveness and disregard for the seriousness of the situation is beyond unacceptable.It's deeply concerning that UniUni employs individuals who engage in criminal behavior and then refuses to take responsibility or assist in rectifying the situation. This raises serious questions about their hiring practices and whether they conduct proper background checks on their employees.I strongly advise anyone considering using UniUni's services to think twice. Their negligence and indifference have caused our family immense stress and violated our sense of security in our own home. Companies like this should not be in business if they can't ensure the safety and trustworthiness of their employees.Would give zero stars if possible.",

Either they are hiring drivers that can't pass a basic very quick background check, or don't have valid ID or insurance. This is not a hard thing. They really really do not care at all about the troops as they have a policy about this that blames the victim who can't get their package and then the vender says it is a uniuni issue and around and around it goes. Do you want your company to look like they hate veterans or are shady AF, than by all means use UniUni.",

I find it hard to believe the time elapsed between out for delivery and missed delivery, 15 min, is reflective of them trying to deliver at all. I called when I noticed this by the afternoon when I checked tracking as absolutely no contact or update had been made. Customer service ended up informing me it could take up to ten additional days for a second attempt as they need to investigate ME for fraud as people keep saying their packages are stolen when they are delivered, I ask how this is relevant to my issue as THEY marked they didn\u2019t deliver and he kept repeating the line about fraud being the reason. I never got an actual answer who knows if ill get my package but I will be reaching out to the seller. update:despite scheduling a redelivery the same day as the missed delivery they went ahead and returned my package to sender, I will never buy from cider again due to this experience.",

        "review_content": "Shopify is not a good platform to host your website. They recently changed their reporting for the merchant account and it is VERY difficult to reconcile your bank account with your sales and payouts. They also hold on to your money for close to a week where other merchant accounts payout the next day. Before this most recent change, there would be about 20-22 payouts per month from the merchant account side of Shopify. Now there are 46-50 payouts per month and sometimes the payouts do not match what went into your bank.Reach out to customer service and they only tell you this is the new way of doing things. If you don't want stress in your life, stay away from Shopify. Find another platform to host your website.",

I soon realized I had 3 stores and by sept was paying for all three. Never used two of them by the way. The whole process was so confusing. I finally figured out how to close all three stores which I did. Or so I thought. Once again this month was charged for 3 stores. At $39 a piece. The kicker is I have no way to even dispute the charges because the only way you can get support is through your store. Meaning I would have to reopen a store I apparently never closed, cuz I\u2019m still charged for them. To even attempt to get this figured out. I\u2019m so unbelievably angry right now.",

It wouldn\u2019t be so bad if they could actually help, but they can\u2019t seem to. One of the support agents was even rude and abruptly ended the chat.

It\u2019s confusing (and concerning) that they enabled this feature before confirming eligibility.Incorrect Document Demands: They\u2019re asking for an official commercial registration, but we\u2019re a nonprofit in Portugal, where nonprofits don\u2019t have commercial registrations. We provided all legally required documents, yet nothing has happened.Customer Support Nightmare: I\u2019ve contacted Shopify Support repeatedly, and they are either unhelpful or just tell me \u201cit\u2019s with another team.\u201d It\u2019s been over 3 months, and still, Shopify is holding our funds with no solution in sight.If you\u2019re considering Shopify, please think twice. Nonprofits, especially, beware\u2014this has been a frustrating and unresolved experience. Our advice: steer clear if you value reliable support and transparency.",

        "review_content": "As an artisan who has sold on Etsy and recently tried Shopify, I have to say that Shopify is challenging for those of us who want to focus more on creating than on marketing. I tried setting up my shop on Shopify, but it felt overwhelming and expensive. Unlike platformslike Etsy, Shopify left me on my own to drive traffic and manage every aspect of marketing.Shopify is great for businesses that want control and customization, but for individual artisans or small creators, it can be a lot to manage. Artisans generally want to focus on making quality products, not spending hours on marketing, SEO, and paid ads just to get a few sales.I think Shopify should consider creating a marketplace specifically for handmade items and unique creations, similar to how Etsy was in its early days. Such a platform could provide the customization options of Shopify but also help sellers by bringing in a built-in audience interested in artisan goods. This way, creators could concentrate on their craft without feeling burdened by all the business logistics.If you\u2019re a creator or artist looking for a marketplace with built-in visibility, be aware that Shopify might not offer the same support as Etsy used to. While Shopify gives you control, it demands a lot more in terms of time, effort, and money to get noticed. I hope Shopify considers this feedback and maybe develops a platform to truly support artisans in the future.",

Recently their 2-factor authentication stopped working, I literally just stopped receiving SMS's from them. Their support is so slow, even for Shopify Plus customers, and they are treating me as though I have done something to prevent the login from working. The hoops I have to jump through now to remove 2factor authentication are unbelievable. I am now in a position where I have not been able to log into my own store for 2 days and I am still waiting for support to reset my account. Shopify has become too big to offer efficient customer support, they are in an arrogant position where they know that it is super difficult to change to another provider, so they are unapologetic in their poor service. We will move to WooCommerce but it is going to take a lot of work and admin to do. If this post helps a handful of online retailers avoid the mistake of choosing Shopify then it has served its purpose.Abundance of success to you !!",

Impossible to complete with platforms like Amazon using this outdated ecommerce platform.To add icing on the cake they deactivated our website claiming we hadn't purchased the theme, we had on a different store which we renamed, per the terms we are allowed to do transfer.. but they gave us one day to do that and before we could figure out how to transfer from an old store which has been closed for close to a decade to our new store, they deactivated the site. There are tons of better options like WooCommerce/BigCommerce, so don't make the mistake we did.",

Discussed internally, realized that we do not need the software any longer after we updated our main shipping software. Reached out to Sifted saying we want to cancel the subscription. Appeared to get into a really bad argument on cancellation with the support team, that was eventually completely resolved, but did cause some nerves.With that, would recommend to track your renewal dats carefully.Returning to the software piece - as originally stated, works well and helps to save money.",

The transition team has been really helpful and responsive. It was always so difficult to get in touch with our old warehouse so I love that we have people available to help whenever it's needed. I also really like their platform. It easily syncs with shopify and you get live updates. It's super easy to change orders as needed and the system automatically picks the cheapest shipping method based on shipping speeds you select, so we're saving some money on shipping too.I can't speak to the longer term relationship but hopeful we'll be with them for a long time!",

Over the course of the 6 months I used them:- They swapped SKUs in the warehouse so customers were consistently receiving the wrong items they purchased. - They were choosing the most expensive shipping options instead of the specific option I specified I wanted used. - Decided to not ship orders to Canada without consulting me. - & Finally, started charging me $550 a month instead of $250 without letting me know. Literally increased my monthly fee by $300 and I had to find out from my bank. Flowspace\u2019s logistics and customer service are such a headache that they are not worth $250, let alone $550. I immediately got all of my inventory out of there and have since switched to ShipBob.com which is 10x better for way less. Do yourself and your business a favor and steer clear of Flowspace.",

Called Ryder office immediately and they punted me off to Pottery Barn rather than bring back what they took. Two weeks later I\u2019m STILL waiting for said hardware because PB had to order it from an overseas vendor. I don\u2019t fault PB because they\u2019re great about taping hardware to inside box with a red ribbon attached so it can\u2019t be missed. Ryder, however, couldn\u2019t be bothered to bring back the box with the hardware they took!",

Today I notified the company I had ordered from that I would (sadly) no longer do business with them wholly due to their use of OnTrac.  Unfortunately we can't see which delivery company is used before we order from companies but this is my only recourse left.  I have had multiple occasions of them leaving packages out on my steps (I have a covered porch two steps further ..... ) even when it is raining.  They must get paid by how few steps they take.

I spent hours on their website trying to get some assistance. I got nothing but dumb auto responses. The phone number I finally got, no one answers or they're self-service - press 1, 2, etc. The answers are standard comments - absolutely no help whatsoever.

I have cameras and confirmed they never attempted a delivery, their local centers have several hundreds to thousands of reviews with the same issue. As best I can surmise they are running a ring of stealing packages and then reselling anything they can for additional profit. They are owned by lasership a now defunct business that went under for doing the exact same thing and resulted in jail time for some managers.

Not only did OnTrac send a notice claiming they attempted delivery, which was a lie, but they have not updated any information on their website regarding my order. I now have to cancel my order. This is not the first time I\u2019ve had a horrible customer service experience with them. I would encourage Walmart and other major companies to not use them. They\u2019re unreliable and their track record speaks for themselves. Stay away from this service.",

However, later that day, I saw an email and realized that my order of vape devices now require a signature from someone 21 and older. I put two into together and realize this was my order for the vapes. So I  go to look at tracking, the package is marked no one\u2019s available. There was never a knock at my door or anything picked up on my ring camera. I text the number back. Sent two emails, now Nov 1, still no response. Thank you to the other review that gave a phone number. I\u2019m going to try that now. I will update this review if it gets any better, but I\u2019m not hopeful at all. This experience has made me 100% certain I will never order from a business again that uses this delivery service.

If its perishable, you'll have to deal with the company you bought it from, as we don't handle any complaints for packages we decide not to deliver.\"It seems a lot of these companies are using these gig based delivery companies and they people that do the deliveries just don't give a damn.I would suggest that you ask ANY company that you buy products from and ask if they use this company for deliveries.

The address is saved on the site, and if they take pictures of deliveries, then they could easily just look at the home in the 3 other deliveries and see they messed up. Their customer service is horrible.  I\u2019d much rather have my packages delivered by USPS. At least they know how to properly follow a gps.",

Never an issue or delay, when UPS or FedEx was the company tasked with delivery after authentication.

The company's use of \u201cindependent\u201d contractors seem to have contributed to the theft of packages. The management offer no accountability, apology, or remedy for the issue. You can literally see a timetable of when your package was stolen. The company is either complicit in the thefts or don't care about the issue. It has been two weeks and no one from management has contacted me concerning the incident.",

After seeing my package was out for delivery, I expected it within the day, but came to find it was marked as undeliverable due to denied access.  This was obviously a lie as the same day TFORCE claimed to be attempting delivery, I also received a delivery from Amazon.  The Amazon driver was able to use the keypad at my apartment building and I was able to allow them access to my building.  The next day TFORCE again claimed to be out for delivery and again claimed to have been denied access to my building.  At the end of day two, my package was marked as \"return to sender\". I checked the front of my building and our mail room, there was no pick up slip left by the delivery driver.  The fact that their drivers are not trained on how apartment buildings work and do not allow for later pick up is so strange.  When I contacted their customer service I was told once packages are returned to sender it is out of their hands.  When I asked why my buzzer was never rung or why I was never called to grant building access I never received a response.",

I personally was working on the receiving dock all afternoon, well after 6 and they never showed up. When I called to question, they said the driver came and \"we were closed\". It is evident that a driver never even came on our premises after video review and our dock doors were open. This caused a customer to be angry with us.Flash forward to today (11/13/24). We scheduled 4 shipments to be picked up yesterday. When we called this afternoon to figure out why they hadn't shown up, they responded with \" you guys cancelled the shipment\" which only one person handles the set up and she DID NOT, and they said the pickup for the other shipments was for today, not yesterday. When in fact, we have the confirmations for pickup for 11/12/24. This again is going to leave our customers angry. They lack transparency and will not own up to the issues they have created.",

Unfortunately we tried them this time after they charged triple the quote for a previous shipment. The company shipping the products uses them, to make things easy for them, we had them handle the shipping again.Backstory, TForce was very good until they broke away from UPS. for the past few years we used them through UPS and we never had any problems.

Then when time to bill, they hugely ignored the bol sent to them and also provided to the driver that finally picked up, and billed incorrectly another company. Asked over and over for the invoice with no luck, Then on top when they finally billed correct party. they charged more without customary report, charged me for asking them to correct their own billing mistake, and they put residential and lift gate charges as penalty for a true commercial location pickup that has truck height dock. Do not use this station.. I have worked with other TF stations and those others have mega rocked. Seen other opinions now and my own, this station should be restructured because they lie, they do not care from the start and abuse the customers with errors. As of today almost 3 months of follow-up, still asking them to fix their mistakes. They are soooo bad that they earned my first review here.",

The products safely took a flight and a truck ride across the border and arrived the next day to our very happy customer. \rI will definitely utilize the services of samedaydelivery.com again and am extremely grateful to Kevin.",

        "review_content": "2nd Update: I posted my review BEFORE reading the other reviews. Now I see almost every single bad review experienced the same as me. Skynet claiming to have attempted delivery but no one came. CCTV and security guards to prove it with no one answering their calls.  I wonder where there packages are going Skynet? Something fishy happening over there?UPDATE: i have tried calling 4 times with no luck. Nothing on whatsapp. Call just cuts now. Their systems and delivery process is the worst i have experience in South Africa. Avoid at all costs.Try give their number a call. I have called twice, first time i sat on the phone waiting for someone to answer. I am now on the phone again and no answer for 12 mins. What do i do?The delivery guys sent a message to say no one was home when someone was waiting all day. We have cctv cameras outsite and no one pitched for delivery, which means they made a mistake and went to wrong house or didnt call.phone them and every 5 seconds this irritating voice says:\"Your call is very important to us, please wait for the next available agent\"and that is why i had to cut to the call. To save my sanityThis delivery company sucks balls. Thats being nice",

I got in touch with customer service and sent a million emails receiving only nonsensical replies, and was finally told that since my parcel contained food, it could not be delivered. I spent more than 40 euros for the delivery (in addition to the money spent on the goods the package contained) and was not even given the opportunity to return it to the sender. I was completely ignored and, what's more, having contracted the Skynet company through Packlink, I was not required to read the strange rules about not being able to send food (written in a guide that can't even be found online), as there are no such restrictions in Packlink. I hope at least in Barcelona they enjoyed the lunch they prepared with MY PRODUCTS paid for with MY MONEY. Enjoy!",

Their delivery guy just left my international parcel (India to New Zealand) next to my rubbish bins outside of my house premises and he didn't contacted me, even though my contact number was clearly mentioned on the parcel.I e-mailed them along with the pics as a proof and they said that they use PBT as their delivery partners and there is nothing much they can do with it. They said that it's PBT's headache not ours. So, he just forwarded my e-mail to PBT. They will keep running away from responsibilities as the person sitting on top is not aware of it's brands face value.So, if you want that type of service, you should definitely choose Skynet Courier as your provider.",

We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused.\u201dTheir advice is to contact the sender for a refund/replacement. It wasn\u2019t a purchased item so refund/replacement isn\u2019t possible.

Call rates between US and Pakistan being what they are, do we have money to burn, that we we will first pay for the package and the shipping and then spend money following up because the carrier is playing passing the parcel with our shipment? Anyone who lives in the US can understand that a package to be delivered to the east coast has no business bouncing around in Nebraska, especially since it landed in NewYork as its port of entry to the U.S. It has gone a full circle from Omaha back to Omaha in the last 4-5 days, while I wait for it on the east coast.

        "review_content": "They confused the house number of my delivery, supposedly delivered it to the address that DOESN'T EXIST. So it took me days to find our through FACEBOOK and kind neighbours where my parcel was - and it ended up being delivered not only to a wrong house number but also to the WRONG STREET. No picture of delivery, no sms or email about change of address of delivery - nothing. And customer support couldn't even help me on the weekend cause \"the department that was meant to add the delivery picture on friday was away till monday\".",

Super disappointing as this package was sent from the UK to Sydney for work purposes. How can a package be marked as delivered when I haven\u2019t received it! Very frustrating and very difficult to contact the company. Link directs to Twitter\u2026I can now see every reviewer had the same experience. How are they still in business with a 1* rating.",

Honestly what is wrong with skynet, they won't be in business for long if this is the kind of service they offer. Terrible terrible terrible the worst. After 3 days of calling and I finally get through to customer service, I am then told that the driver got hijacked, it's like a joke, they don't take their business seriously. I'm disgusted by this",

Did I receive any call back or updates, of course not... This is what happens when you're a useless and incompetent company.

        "review_content": "Today I had a horrible experience with trinity logistics. I booked a load with Ryan a load from Maximus crane in Louisiana and delivered to Odessa, Tx 900 mile run. I agreed to move this load for $2400 which is less than $3 per mile. Due to the weather being horrible at that time and I blew an airbag, it set me delivering the load 2 hours late. I informed Ryan what was going on When I finally made it to delivery the warehouse was closed. I slept overnight at location until the next morning and delivered the load once the place was open. Today my factoring company called me and said trinity logistics refused to pay the load.On the RC it clearly states that they couldn\u2019t take no more then 500$ but These guys took the entire load.I drove 900 miles paid 600$ in fuel out of my pocket for nothing,I didn\u2019t get a penny for this load which is Insane I never heard of this before for being late.Im calling there insurance in the morning and filing a claim.Ryan was the broker I was dealing with but when I talked to him today he put me off on some guy named cotter.If you carriers haul for this company please stay away from Ryan and cotter ,this is not the first time Ryan was mentioned in the reviews.Will keep you guys posted on how this thing plays out.TO ALL MY TRUCKERS KEEP TRUCKING\ud83e\udee1",

On the day of delivery, I made sure there was someone at my flat at all times, but they just phoned me and never rang the bell. This caused significant delays to the building of my kitchen as they would not come back until almost a whole week later. When they did come back, they forgot several key items including the worktop - which took additional days before these came and I was never phoned or consulted if these new rearranged delivery times suited.  When I repeatedly asked for the proof of delivery photo from the first original attempt, I was only send this a week later when they had come to my flat 2x and the timestamp on the photo was way before when they phoned me to announce the delivery. XPO also did not provide any compensation for this whole ordeal, leaving this to Homebase who in my opinion did not provide suitable financial compensation for the extent of the issues I experienced. I would highly encourage anyone to stay away from any companies that use XPO for their delivery.",

Still have no reason for it not arriving! Finally 1 week after they originally said they would deliver it has arrived. The delivery drivers were extremely rude, wanted me to sign before even seeing the item (that was still inside the van) and wanted me to carry a shed by myself out the van and round the back.

I purchased an electric wheel chair which was shipped from the east coast to Portland, Oregon.  It was put on the wrong truck in Salt Lake City, Utah and was delayed by 3 days.  It is now at their depot in Oregon, about 10 miles from my home, but will not be delivered to me for 2 to 4 days from now.  I asked to pick it up at their depot but can't because it is in another truck going to their contracted delivery company which is about 40 miles from me.  Does not make sense and is very inefficient.  A projected 4 to 7 day delivery by the seller has now been 14 days and I still do not have the chair.",

        "review_content": "I purchased a 12-foot ladder from Home Depot.  Swift Transportation was the delivery company.   Yes, I had to pay for the shipping.   They delivered my ladder this morning.   One side of the ladder was destroyed...bent metal support, broken rivets, and the aluminum steps bent.  The delivery driver concealed the damage by laying the ladder on the ground with the damaged side down.  Then he drove off instead of returning the ladder to Home Depot and letting them know that a replacement would be necessary.  I got an email within a minute of the delivery and found the damaged ladder outside.  I immediately called Home Depot, who in turn called Swift.  Within 5 minutes of the delivery, they had Swift on the phone and asked them to pick up the ladder since they were only 5 minutes away.   The delivery driver refused to come back to pick up the damaged item.  This is a company with poor ethics...and I'm imagining that this is what they trained their employees to do.  Otherwise, they would be taking responsibility for the shipping damages. Failure #1:  damaging the itemFailure #2:  delivering the damaged item and concealing the damageFailure #3:  refusing to come and pick the item up while they are still in the neighborhood.

        "review_content": "WARNING:  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY or you will regret the decision.  They will send you every invoice from the freight company (upcharged of course) even when they know it is not valid.  If you ask them to dispute a charge, most often they will not put it thought.  If you call to ask for disposition, you are ignored.  If you file your own claim for damaged goods and the freight company (in the unlikely event) pays the broker for the damages, you will NEVER see that money.  This is because they apply it to your open invoices EVEN IF THEY ARE IN DISPUTE.  These guys are out for your money.  Don't expect to see a dime from disputes and expect to receive unexpected add-on invoices months after a shipment is closed.",

The BOL created by GlobalTranz lists a phone # 888-706-4381 which is a Vacation Club. Using the internet to get contact number I have called everyday and have tired claims and customer service, I have been on hold each time for up to 45 minutes and I am never connected to an agent. This company seems to be a scam, no where to be found when you need them, wrong contact numbers and will not answer the phone.",

        "review_content": "My experience with GlobalTranz was a complete disaster. They initially lost my products, and after several weeks of waiting, they finally located them and delivered them to us. However, upon receipt, we discovered that the pallets were unpacked, and many items were damaged and missing. Despite the driver noting the damage and losses on the POD, filing a claim with GlobalTranz was a nightmare. The agent handling our claim was extremely reluctant and took days to process it, all while being rude and disrespectful to our team. We were even pressured to pay the invoices first, despite them being inflated with reclassifications and added fees. Despite our compliance, our claim, filed over a year ago, remains unresolved.Overall, GlobalTranz is dishonest, unprofessional, disorganized, and has the worst customer service imaginable. While I typically refrain from leaving negative reviews, I feel compelled to warn others about their poor practices. I sincerely hope no one else has to endure the same ordeal. If possible, I would give them negative 100 stars. Proceed with caution if considering their services, as you may end up regretting it as much as I do.",

Previously, closely to 50% of the shipment was smashed and beyond redemption. This time, I have been waiting for a delivery since last week, and each time there is a different story, and I have to keep repeating myself including correcting my phone number at least three times so far! Worse, they work with a home delivery partner called \"Humble\" in Massachusetts, who are even more ridiculous than Estes. Phone messages are not returned, and information is provided as drip-drip-drip, so each time one has to go through the torture of navigating their phone system, then speak with someone at the other end of the Pacific whose responses are so obtuse, you wonder if they are lifelings on Mars! Henceforth, I will always check if a vendor ships through Estes or Humble first, and if so, will not do business with that company. Rob Estes, where is your leadership?",

        "review_content": "Estes shipped a very expensive, non replaceable piece of machinery for my Metal Fabrication business. The forklift driver drove into the machine instead of picking it up from under the pallet. They damaged the front panel and broke all of the controls, all of the linkages and the foot control pedals. They caused $16,000 in damage to my equipment. I paid for the damage and submitted a claim with proof of cost and payment and they denied my claim. How can a company cause $16K worth of damage to someone\u2019s equipment and then get away with not paying for it. I am a small business owner that makes American made products and keep employees on payroll even through the Covid downturn. This is a substantial hit to my business and a logistic that doesn\u2019t care. Don\u2019t use this company, they have no values and will not cover the damage they cause. They get bonuses based on how much they deny in claims so they are quick to deny you. This is a horrible business practice, they set up their employees to deny claims so they get bigger checks.",

        "review_content": "Worst delivery company I ever dealt with... do not use them if you can avoid it. they only have semis with trailers for delivery and no drivers that can back one up a long driveway. Our order instructions (from them) was they would deliver it to the nearest dry spot by our home. Instead they left it alongside a 2 lane highway and did not even notify us they did so...after we had told them we have no way to move a 200lb box on a pallet up a long driveway. Their last response was they would find an 'experienced' driver the next day to deliver it. Instead they drop it on the highway roadside and when we call they say the delivery is \"curbside\" which to them is along the highway. Then they hung up on us. I have personally run large distribution systems myself and never even heard of such poor practices, lack of communication, and irresponsible people. What a mess! Cannot say anything good about this company. They do not deserve 1 star.",

He would not return my text or calls, he instead had his supervisor call me. He was no help either, he told me the crate would be easy to break apart with a claw hammer. Then he told me\u201dmaybe a family member could help me\u201d. I do not have either. Then he told me the driver could not come back before the next day. I could not leave the mower because someone could come by steal it. I sat out in the heat over 5 hours before I finally found someone to help me. I called Home Depot & they sent someone out to help me.  I would not recommend this company to haul my garbage.",
